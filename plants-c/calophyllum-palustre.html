                    <h1>Calophyllum palustre</h1>
<p>Calophyllum palustre, commonly known as swamp calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, spiky shell. It thrives in moist, swampy soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
