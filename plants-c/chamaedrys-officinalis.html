                    <h1>Chamaedrys officinalis</h1>
<p>Chamaedrys officinalis, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, upright growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>
<p>Chamaedrys officinalis has been historically valued for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
