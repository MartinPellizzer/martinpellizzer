<p>Cousinia sagittata subsp.</p>
<p>sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf cottonthistle, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, arrow-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
