                    <h1>Cladium palustre</h1>
<p>Cladium palustre, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in marshy areas. Sawgrass is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions.</p>
