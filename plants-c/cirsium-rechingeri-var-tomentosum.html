                    <h1>Cirsium rechingeri var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Cirsium rechingeri var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spherical shape known as a "globular head.". It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
