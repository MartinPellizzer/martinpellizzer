                    <h1>Cereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus</h1>
<p>Cereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and rock gardens.</p>
