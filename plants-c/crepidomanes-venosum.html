<p>Crepidomanes venosum, commonly known as the veiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, often found in still or slow-moving waters. It has a unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms using its bladder-like structures, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of clean, oxygen-rich water environments.</p>
