                    <h1>Camaridium pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Camaridium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf camara, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Camaridaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short, compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed around its central stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
