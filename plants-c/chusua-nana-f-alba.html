                    <h1>Chusua nana f. alba</h1>
<p>Chusua nana f. alba, commonly known as white alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils at high altitudes.</p>
