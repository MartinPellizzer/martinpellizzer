<p>Chaenactis mainsiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves and a single, elongated flower stalk that bears a single flower. The plant typically grows in high-elevation habitats, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pale blue or white, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
