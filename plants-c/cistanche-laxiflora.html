                    <h1>Cistanche laxiflora</h1>
<p>Cistanche laxiflora, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, primarily those in the genus Artemisia, through its haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems.</p>
