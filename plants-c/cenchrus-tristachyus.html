                    <h1>Cenchrus tristachyus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus tristachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or goat grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Cenchrus tristachyus is often used for forage by livestock and has some traditional medicinal uses in certain regions.</p>
