                    <h1>Carex leporina f. nana</h1>
<p>Carex leporina f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes.</p>
