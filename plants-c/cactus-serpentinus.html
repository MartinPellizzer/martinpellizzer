                    <h1>Cactus serpentinus</h1>
<p>Cactus serpentinus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
