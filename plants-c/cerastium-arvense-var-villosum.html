                    <h1>Cerastium arvense var. villosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium arvense var. villosum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
