                    <h1>Carex gracilis f. graciliflora</h1>
<p>Carex gracilis f. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered sedges, is a variant of the slender sedge, characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often green or brown, depending on the season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
