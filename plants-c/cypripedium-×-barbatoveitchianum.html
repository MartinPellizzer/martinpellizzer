                    <h1>Cypripedium × barbatoveitchianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × barbatoveitchianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium barbatum and Cypripedium vovkii.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>The species is also of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and hybrid origins.</p>
