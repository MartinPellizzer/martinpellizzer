                    <h1>Cyclogramma</h1>
<p>Cyclogramma, commonly known as the needle-scale burr or sand mat, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Cyclogramma species are often found in desert or semi-desert habitats, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic conditions and ecological restoration projects.</p>
