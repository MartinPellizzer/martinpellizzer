<p>Cyrilwhitea, commonly known as the white cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in cones. Cyrilwhitea species are slow-growing and have a long lifespan, often reaching several decades.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered threatened.</p>
