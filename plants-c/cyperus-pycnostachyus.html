                    <h1>Cyperus pycnostachyus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pycnostachyus, commonly known as the thick-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it often grows in wet or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
