                    <h1>Ceratozamia mexicana var. robusta</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia mexicana var. robusta, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
