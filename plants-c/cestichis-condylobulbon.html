                    <h1>Cestichis condylobulbon</h1>
<p>Cestichis condylobulbon, commonly known as the red lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a crust-like growth on tree bark and soil.</p>
<p>It has a bright red or orange thallus that can be easily distinguished from other lichens. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is simple, with no true roots, stems, or leaves, but it plays an important role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
