<p>Coryphantha pycnacantha subsp.</p>
<p>sniceri, commonly known as the Mexican golden barrel cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular stem that is covered with dense, pale green spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience.</p>
