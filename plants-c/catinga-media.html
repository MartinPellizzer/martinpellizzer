<p>Catinga media, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown hue. The plant has a straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces woody pods containing flat, oval seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its high value for musical instruments, Catinga media is critically endangered due to overharvesting.</p>
