<p>Chasme teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chasm, is a rare and striking plant native to specific high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Chasme teretifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
