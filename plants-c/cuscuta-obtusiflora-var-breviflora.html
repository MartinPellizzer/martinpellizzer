                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. breviflora, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked.</p>
