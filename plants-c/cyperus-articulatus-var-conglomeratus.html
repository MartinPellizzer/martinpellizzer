                    <h1>Cyperus articulatus var. conglomeratus</h1>
<p>Cyperus articulatus var. conglomeratus, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
