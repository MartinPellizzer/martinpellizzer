                    <h1>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. peirsonii</h1>
<p>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's corethrogyne, is a rare and striking member of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress or in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with bright yellow stamens, which are typically borne on slender, upright inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
