<p>Copiapoa solaris, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment.</p>
<p>Copiapoa solaris is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering.</p>
