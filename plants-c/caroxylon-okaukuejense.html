                    <h1>Caroxylon okaukuejense</h1>
<p>Caroxylon okaukuejense, commonly known as the Okaukueje cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, fibrous bark, which provides structural support and protection against pests. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan, often exceeding several centuries. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves arranged in spirals, typical of many conifer species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon okaukuejense is considered critically endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
