                <h1>Chelonistele clemensii</h1>
<p>Chelonistele clemensii, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often grow along rocky substrates, anchoring it to steep slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Chelonistele clemensii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
