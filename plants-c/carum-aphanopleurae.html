                    <h1>Carum aphanopleurae</h1>
<p>Carum aphanopleurae, commonly known as the ghost caraway, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of other caraway species, often leading to confusion in identification.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carum aphanopleurae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
