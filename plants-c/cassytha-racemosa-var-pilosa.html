                    <h1>Cassytha racemosa var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Cassytha racemosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy false dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its specialized parasitic lifestyle, relying entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
