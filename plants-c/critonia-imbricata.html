<p>Critonia imbricata, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Critonia imbricata is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
