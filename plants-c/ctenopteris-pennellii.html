<p>Ctenopteris pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's water fern, is a species of marine fern found in tropical coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in shallow, brackish or saltwater environments, often attached to submerged rocks or mangrove roots. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris pennellii plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
