<p>Ceratozamia mixeorum, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
