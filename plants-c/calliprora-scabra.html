                    <h1>Calliprora scabra</h1>
<p>Calliprora scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a rough, uneven texture, while the lower surface is usually lighter and covered with tiny, rounded lobes. The thallus is composed of a complex intergrowth of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form the symbiotic structure of the lichen. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
