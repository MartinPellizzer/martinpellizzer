<p>Conami conami, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
