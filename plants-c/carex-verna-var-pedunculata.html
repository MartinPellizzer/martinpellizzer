<p>Carex verna var. pedunculata, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers in early spring. It is often found in association with other early successional plants in forested areas.</p>
<p>The variety pedunculata is distinguished by its elongated flower stalks, which elevate the inflorescence above the foliage.</p>
