<p>Cypripedium orientale, commonly known as the oriental lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a deep, velvety pouch that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Cypripedium orientale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
