<p>Cistus villosus subsp.</p>
<p>corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
