                    <h1>Cyperus cyperoides var. brevispicatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyperoides var. brevispicatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. Its flowering structures are adapted for aquatic pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its short, broad-based spikelets, which set it apart from other Cyperus species.</p>
