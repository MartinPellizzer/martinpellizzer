                    <h1>Campanula raveyi</h1>
<p>Campanula raveyi, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
