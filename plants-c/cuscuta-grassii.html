                    <h1>Cuscuta grassii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta grassii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant forms a dense network of filaments around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants in various habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species.</p>
