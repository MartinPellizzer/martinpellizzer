<p>Coriophyllus purpureus, commonly known as the purple coralplant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Coriophyllus purpureus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
