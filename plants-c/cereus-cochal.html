                    <h1>Cereus cochal</h1>
<p>Cereus cochal, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, often closing by morning, which is a unique trait among cacti.</p>
