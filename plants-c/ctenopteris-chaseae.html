<p>Ctenopteris chaseae, commonly known as the Chase's sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in marine environments. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize sediments and provide habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris chaseae is also noted for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, which contributes to its ecological adaptability.</p>
