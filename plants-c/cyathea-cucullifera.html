                    <h1>Cyathea cucullifera</h1>
<p>Cyathea cucullifera, commonly known as the hooded tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, almost hood-like shape at the base. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy.</p>
