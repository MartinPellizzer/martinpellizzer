                    <h1>Cathartolinum flagellare</h1>
<p>Cathartolinum flagellare, commonly known as the whiplash fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its elongated, whip-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its rhizome system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rare occurrence and ecological significance, Cathartolinum flagellare is considered a conservation priority in its native habitats.</p>
