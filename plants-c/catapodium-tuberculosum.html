<p>Catapodium tuberculosum, commonly known as the tuberculate catapodium, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
