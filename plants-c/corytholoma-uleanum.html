                    <h1>Corytholoma uleanum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma uleanum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-orange berries that contain sticky seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it also photosynthesizes to a limited extent. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, making it a significant ecological concern in certain regions.</p>
<p>The golden mistletoe is often found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
