                    <h1>Cactus lehmannii</h1>
<p>Cactus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus lehmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
