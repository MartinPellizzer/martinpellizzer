<p>Carex ampullacea var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>

The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and pond margins. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a tight rosette, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
