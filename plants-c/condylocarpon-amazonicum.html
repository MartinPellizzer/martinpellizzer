                    <h1>Condylocarpon amazonicum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in the humid tropical environments of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a crucial role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest by contributing to soil formation and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of environmental health and stability in the region.</p>
