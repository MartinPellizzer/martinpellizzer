                    <h1>Cereus dasyacanthus var. neomexicanus</h1>
<p>Cereus dasyacanthus var. neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth habit is typically solitary, though it may form clusters under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert regions.</p>
