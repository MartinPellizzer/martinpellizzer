                    <h1>Cassytha guineensis var. livingstonii</h1>
<p>Cassytha guineensis var. livingstonii, commonly known as the slender cassytha, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often twine around other plants, and its small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats.</p>
