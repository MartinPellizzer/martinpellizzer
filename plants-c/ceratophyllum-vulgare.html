                    <h1>Ceratophyllum vulgare</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum vulgare, commonly known as hornwort, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has a dense, branching structure with small, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its stem and leaves. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers, where it provides habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum vulgare is also used in aquariums due to its ability to oxygenate water and support fish populations.</p>
