<p>Cyperus multiglumis, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet soils effectively.</p>
<p>Cyperus multiglumis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
