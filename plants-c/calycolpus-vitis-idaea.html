<p>Calycolpus vitis-idaea, commonly known as trailing arctostaphylos, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species but are generally not consumed by humans.</p>
