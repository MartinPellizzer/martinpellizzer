                    <h1>Chamaerhodos corymbosa</h1>
<p>Chamaerhodos corymbosa, commonly known as the red cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The red cholla is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to maximize water absorption.</p>
