<p>Caragana cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and parts of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Caragana cinerea is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It has been used historically for erosion control and as a source of fuel and forage.</p>
