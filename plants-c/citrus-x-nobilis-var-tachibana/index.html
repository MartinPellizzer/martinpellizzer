                            <h1>Citrus × Nobilis Var. Tachibana</h1>
<p>Tachibana orange, scientifically known as Citrus × nobilis var. tachibana, is a unique citrus fruit native to Japan. It is prized for its sweet, tangy flavor and distinct aroma, making it a favorite in both culinary and traditional uses. The fruit is smaller than typical oranges, with a thick, textured rind that is often used in Japanese cuisine. Its juice is rich in vitamins and antioxidants, contributing to its popularity in health-conscious diets. Despite its limited commercial cultivation, the Tachibana orange remains a symbol of cultural and agricultural heritage in Japan.</p>
