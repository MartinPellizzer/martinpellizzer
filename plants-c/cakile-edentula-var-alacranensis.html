                    <h1>Cakile edentula var. alacranensis</h1>
<p>Cakile edentula var. alacranensis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to reduce water loss, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
