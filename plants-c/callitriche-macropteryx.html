<p>Callitriche macropteryx, commonly known as the broad-winged water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and are clustered in small umbels, making it attractive to pollinators like beetles and flies.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
