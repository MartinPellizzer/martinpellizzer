<p>Catabrosa elodes, commonly known as water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has thin, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, allowing it to maximize light absorption in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found above the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Catabrosa elodes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
