                    <h1>Cassytha remotiflora</h1>
<p>Cassytha remotiflora, commonly known as the creeping grapevine, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, serpentine stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground or through trees. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Cassytha remotiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
