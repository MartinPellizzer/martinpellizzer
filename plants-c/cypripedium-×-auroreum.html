                    <h1>Cypripedium × auroreum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × auroreum, commonly known as the golden tassel lily, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow hue and a distinctive tassel-like structure at the top of the lip. Its leaves are typically dark green and heart-shaped, and it is often found growing in rich, humus-filled soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
