                    <h1>Croton regeneratrix</h1>
<p>Croton regeneratrix, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is notable for its ability to survive extreme dehydration by entering a state of dormancy. When rehydrated, the plant can "resurrect" itself, rapidly regaining its turgid structure and green coloration. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This remarkable adaptability makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural practices.</p>
