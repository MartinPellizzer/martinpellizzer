<p>Carduus talassicus, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, while its deep root system allows it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Carduus talassicus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
