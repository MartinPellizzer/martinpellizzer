                    <h1>Caropodium armenum</h1>
<p>Caropodium armenum, commonly known as Armenian moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottioideae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body that absorbs water and nutrients directly. It typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
