                    <h1>Cyperus orbicephalus</h1>
<p>Cyperus orbicephalus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist soil and is often found in marshes, swales, and other waterlogged habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus orbicephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
