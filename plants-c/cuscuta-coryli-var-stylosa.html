                    <h1>Cuscuta coryli var. stylosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta coryli var. stylosa, commonly known as the horse chestnut dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that attaches itself to the stems of host plants, primarily horse chestnut trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in woodland areas where its host trees grow. It is an annual plant with a short life cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or ornamental settings.</p>
