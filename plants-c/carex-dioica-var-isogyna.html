                    <h1>Carex dioica var. isogyna</h1>
<p>Carex dioica var. isogyna, commonly known as the smooth sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has two distinct forms, with the var. isogyna being the male form that lacks the female flowers found in the typical Carex dioica.</p>
<p>This variation contributes to its role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
