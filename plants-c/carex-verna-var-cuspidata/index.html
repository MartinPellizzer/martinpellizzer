<p>Cuspidate sedge, scientifically known as Carex verna var. cuspidata, is a striking member of the sedge family found in moist, temperate regions. This plant is recognized for its slender, triangular stems and clusters of small, grass-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. It typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Often growing in wetlands or along stream edges, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its resilience and beauty make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
