                            <h1>Cryptantha Rigida</h1>
<p>Rigid cryptantha, scientifically known as Cryptantha rigida, is a hardy flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Despite its resilience, it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
