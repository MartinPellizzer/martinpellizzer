<p>Ctenitis subconnexa var. alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and intricate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
