                    <h1>Cassytha polysperma</h1>
<p>Cassytha polysperma, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender stems. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread widely across different environments.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and providing resources for certain insect species.</p>
