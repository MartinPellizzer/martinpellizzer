<p>Ceropegia arcuata subsp.</p>
<p>mirkinii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or silver vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often visited by specific pollinators, such as moths. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies mirkinii is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other members of the species.</p>
