<p>Chaenotheca, commonly known as the "buttercup lichen," is a genus of foliose lichens belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is usually green or yellowish in color, and is often found on tree bark or soil. The genus includes several species, such as *Chaenotheca clavata*, which is known for its distinctive, club-shaped apothecia. These lichens are typically found in temperate regions and play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Their simple structure and ability to thrive in moist environments make them important indicators of ecological health.</p>
