                    <h1>Cephalanthera pallens var. collina</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera pallens var. collina, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, dark purple to black inflorescence composed of numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
