                    <h1>Calydermos</h1>
<p>Calydermos, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Calydermos is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
