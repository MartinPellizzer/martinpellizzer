                    <h1>Calycobolus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Calycobolus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty calycobolus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown veins and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calycobolus ferrugineus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
