                    <h1>Cypripedium pubescens</h1>
<p>Cypripedium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive yellow pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, upright stem that bears the ornate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, Cypripedium pubescens is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is also protected in many regions to preserve its natural habitat.</p>
