                    <h1>Cynanchum salinarum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum salinarum, commonly known as the saltbush or saltbush milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
