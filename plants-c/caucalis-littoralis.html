                    <h1>Caucalis littoralis</h1>
<p>Caucalis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caucalis littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
