                    <h1>Coryphopteris subbipinnata</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris subbipinnata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with secondary pinnae that are narrow and closely spaced. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through rhizome growth, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
