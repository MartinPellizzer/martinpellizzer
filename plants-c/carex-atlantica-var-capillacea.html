                    <h1>Carex atlantica var. capillacea</h1>
<p>Carex atlantica var. capillacea, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, triangular spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the summer. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, dunes, and along the edges of tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
