                    <h1>Crassula sebaeoides</h1>
<p>Crassula sebaeoides, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
