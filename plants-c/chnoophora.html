                    <h1>Chnoophora</h1>
<p>Chnoophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, underground stem and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms for only a short period.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Chnoophora is considered an endangered species.</p>
