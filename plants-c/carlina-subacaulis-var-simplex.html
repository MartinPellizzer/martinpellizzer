<p>Carlina subacaulis var. simplex, commonly known as the simpleleaf carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
