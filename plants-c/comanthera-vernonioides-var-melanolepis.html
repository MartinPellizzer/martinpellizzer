<p>Comanthera vernonioides var. melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is part of the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them.</p>
