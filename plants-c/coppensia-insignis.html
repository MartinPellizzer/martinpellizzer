                    <h1>Coppensia insignis</h1>
<p>Coppensia insignis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by wind. Coppensia insignis is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
