                    <h1>Cyperus praemorsus</h1>
<p>Cyperus praemorsus, commonly known as the deathhead sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown or yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus praemorsus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
