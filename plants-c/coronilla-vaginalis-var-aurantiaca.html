                    <h1>Coronilla vaginalis var. aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Coronilla vaginalis var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange blossom vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
