<p>Cocklebur, scientifically known as Cleome papillosa, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in warm, sunny environments. While it is not typically cultivated for food, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
