                    <h1>Coffea dewevrei var. neoarnoldiana</h1>
<p>Coffea dewevrei var. neoarnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of Cameroon and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and red flowers. The plant produces small, cherry-like fruits that contain two seeds, which are used for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
