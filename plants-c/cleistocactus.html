                    <h1>Cleistocactus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus, commonly known as the "closed flower cactus," is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. They produce small, often hidden flowers that bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they close shortly after opening, giving the plant its name.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus species are adapted to arid environments and require well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
