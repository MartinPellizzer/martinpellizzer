                    <h1>Carex panicea var. rhizogyna</h1>
<p>Carex panicea var. rhizogyna, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This variant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
