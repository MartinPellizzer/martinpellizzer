                            <h1>Centranthus × Intermedius</h1>
<p>Centranthus × intermedius is a striking hybrid plant known for its vibrant, spire-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and red. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for borders and rock gardens. Its long-lasting blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, adding both beauty and ecological benefit. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
