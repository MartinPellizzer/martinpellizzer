                    <h1>Coleotrype goudotii var. typica</h1>
<p>Coleotrype goudotii var. typica, commonly known as the Goudot's truffle, is a rare and elusive fungal species belonging to the Tuberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, irregularly shaped fruiting body with a dense, white to pale yellow mycelium. The fruiting bodies typically develop underground, forming a symbiotic relationship with the roots of certain trees and shrubs. The spore-bearing surface, known as the gleba, is rich in volatile compounds that contribute to its distinct aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but challenging subject for mycological study.</p>
