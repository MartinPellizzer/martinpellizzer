                    <h1>Cystopteris dentata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, triangular fronds that are often divided into small, tooth-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to moist substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats.</p>
