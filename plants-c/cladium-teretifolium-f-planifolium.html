                    <h1>Cladium teretifolium f. planifolium</h1>
<p>Cladium teretifolium f. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical form, which aids in its identification. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in saturated conditions.</p>
<p>This form is particularly adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
