<p>Cyrtomium caryotideum var. aequibasis, commonly known as the broad-basined holly fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, evergreen fronds that are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive broad, rounded base on each leaf. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
