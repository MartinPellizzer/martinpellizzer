                    <h1>Calanthe regnieri</h1>
<p>Calanthe regnieri, commonly known as the Philippine calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, with inflorescences bearing several flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are elliptical, firm, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Calanthe regnieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments.</p>
