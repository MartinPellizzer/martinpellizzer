                    <h1>Calciphilopteris alleniae</h1>
<p>Calciphilopteris alleniae, commonly known as the Allen's rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich environments, often growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for calcareous ecosystems.</p>
