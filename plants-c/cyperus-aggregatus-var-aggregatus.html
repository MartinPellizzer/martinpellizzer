                    <h1>Cyperus aggregatus var. aggregatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aggregatus var. aggregatus, commonly known as the marsh sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
