                    <h1>Cardamine borbonica var. arabica</h1>
<p>Cardamine borbonica var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabica watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, elongated pods containing tiny seeds. Native to the wetlands of southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
