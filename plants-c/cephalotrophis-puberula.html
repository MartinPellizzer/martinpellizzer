                    <h1>Cephalotrophis puberula</h1>
<p>Cephalotrophis puberula, commonly known as the hairy-headed water frog, is a species of aquatic frog found in the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy growth on the head and back, which provides camouflage in its moist environment. The plant-like appearance of its skin and the presence of small, leaf-like structures on its body are adaptations to its amphibious lifestyle. It thrives in freshwater habitats with dense vegetation, using its webbed toes for efficient movement through water.</p>
<p>The species plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger predators.</p>
