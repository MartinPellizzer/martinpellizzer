<p>Ctenopteris aspleniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its fronds are typically divided into small, serrated segments, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris aspleniifolia is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water.</p>
