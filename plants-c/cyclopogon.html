                    <h1>Cyclopogon</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon, commonly known as the cyclops orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their unique, showy inflorescences. Cyclopogon species typically feature a short, stocky rhizome and produce striking, often brightly colored flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specialized habitat needs, many Cyclopogon species are endangered and are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
