<p>Cecropia juranyiana, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, often whitish bark. The plant has palmately compound leaves that are typically large and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
