<p>Cirrhopetalum nilgherrense, commonly known as the Nilgiri orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendant-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
