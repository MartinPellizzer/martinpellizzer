<p>Cereus papillosus, commonly known as the "pencil cactus," is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that resemble bamboo, which are covered in small, white, hair-like structures called papillae. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or white, which open only during the evening. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cereus papillosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
