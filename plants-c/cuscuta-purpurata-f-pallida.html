                    <h1>Cuscuta purpurata f. pallida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta purpurata f. pallida, commonly known as the pale dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color, contrasting with its usual reddish hue. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to wrap around and attach to its host. It is often found on crops such as corn and beans, where it can cause significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and survival of its host, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
