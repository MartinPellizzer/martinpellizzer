                    <h1>Cycas media var. basaltica</h1>
<p>Cycas media var. basaltica, commonly known as the Basalt Cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, palm-like cluster. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
