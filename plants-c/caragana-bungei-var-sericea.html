<p>Caragana bungei var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
