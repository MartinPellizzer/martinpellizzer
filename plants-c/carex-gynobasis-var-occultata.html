                    <h1>Carex gynobasis var. occultata</h1>
<p>Carex gynobasis var. occultata, commonly known as the hidden sedge, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Carex genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, wetland environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
