<p>Cystopteris caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Cystopteris caucasica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
