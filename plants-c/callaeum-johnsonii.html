                    <h1>Callaeum johnsonii</h1>
<p>Callaeum johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's callaeum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is pollinated primarily by specific species of beetles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Callaeum johnsonii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
