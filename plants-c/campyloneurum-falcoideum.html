<p>Campyloneurum falcoideum, commonly known as the falcon's wing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the wings of a falcon. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
