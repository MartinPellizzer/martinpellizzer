<p>Cephalotaxus nana var. adstringens, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant in woodland settings.</p>
