                    <h1>Cyperus ottonis var. humilior</h1>
<p>Cyperus ottonis var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, compact clumps, and its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland habitats, with rhizomes that help in spreading and anchoring the plant.</p>
