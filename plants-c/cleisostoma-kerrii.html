<p>Cleisostoma kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a strong, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Cleisostoma kerrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
