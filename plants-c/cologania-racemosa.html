                    <h1>Cologania racemosa</h1>
<p>Cologania racemosa, commonly known as the clustered coralroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is part of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Cologania racemosa is often found in pine and hardwood forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory flora.</p>
