<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, small, spike-like inflorescence that bears tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
