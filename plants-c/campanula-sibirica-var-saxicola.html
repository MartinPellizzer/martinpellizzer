                    <h1>Campanula sibirica var. saxicola</h1>
<p>Campanula sibirica var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola bellflower, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
