                    <h1>Calanthe veratrifolia var. stenochila</h1>
<p>Calanthe veratrifolia var. stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
