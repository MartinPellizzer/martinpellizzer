<p>Cactus columnaris, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The stems are typically ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It produces yellow or white flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
