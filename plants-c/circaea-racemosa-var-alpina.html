                    <h1>Circaea racemosa var. alpina</h1>
<p>Circaea racemosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
