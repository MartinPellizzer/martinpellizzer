                    <h1>Cyperus bulbipes var. pallescens</h1>
<p>Cyperus bulbipes var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The pale bulbous flatsedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
