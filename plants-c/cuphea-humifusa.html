<p>Cuphea humifusa, commonly known as the stickyweed or dwarf cuphea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that often produce a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Cuphea humifusa is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
