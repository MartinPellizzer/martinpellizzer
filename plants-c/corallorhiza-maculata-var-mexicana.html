                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican pink beard tongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the petals. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to its parasitic lifestyle and specific ecological niche.</p>
