                    <h1>Ceraia simplicissima</h1>
<p>Ceraia simplicissima, commonly known as the simple sponge or sea sponge, is a marine organism that belongs to the class Hexactinellida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its porous, spongy structure composed of silica-based spicules, which provide structural support and filtration capabilities. This species is typically found in deep-sea environments, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling through its filter-feeding activity. The body of Ceraia simplicissima is often covered in a gelatinous matrix that aids in capturing plankton and other microscopic particles.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biological features, it is of interest to marine biologists studying deep-sea ecosystems and sponge biodiversity.</p>
