<p>Crassula rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>commutata, commonly known as the rock crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, typical of succulents.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant for arid environments.</p>
