<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered near the margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaved rock fern is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment.</p>
