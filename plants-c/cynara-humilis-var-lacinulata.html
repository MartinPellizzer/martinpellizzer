                    <h1>Cynara humilis var. lacinulata</h1>
<p>Cynara humilis var. lacinulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved artichoke, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces a spiky, thistle-like flower head that transitions from green to purple as it matures. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value.</p>
<p>While not as commonly cultivated as the edible artichoke, it is appreciated for its ornamental qualities and resilience in arid conditions.</p>
