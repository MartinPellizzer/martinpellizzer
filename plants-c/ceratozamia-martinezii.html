                    <h1>Ceratozamia martinezii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
