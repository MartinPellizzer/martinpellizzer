                    <h1>Croton trichocephalus var. leptophyllus</h1>
<p>Croton trichocephalus var. leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications are less well-documented compared to other Croton species.</p>
