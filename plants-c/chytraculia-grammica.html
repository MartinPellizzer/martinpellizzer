<p>Chytraculia grammica, commonly known as the grammic chytra, is a species of aquatic fungus belonging to the class Chytridiomycota.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments, where it plays a role in decomposing organic matter. The organism is characterized by its small, motile zoospores that are released into the water column. These zoospores are equipped with a single flagellum, enabling them to swim toward suitable substrates for colonization.</p>
<p>Chytraculia grammica is an important component of the microbial food web in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
