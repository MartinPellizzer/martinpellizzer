<p>Chrysaspis brutia, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling spider webs. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chrysaspis brutia is considered a threatened species.</p>
