                    <h1>Corallorhiza striata f. eburnea</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza striata f. eburnea, commonly known as the white coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive striated pattern on the petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
