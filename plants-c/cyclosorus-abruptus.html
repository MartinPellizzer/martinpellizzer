                    <h1>Cyclosorus abruptus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus abruptus, commonly known as the abrupt cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
