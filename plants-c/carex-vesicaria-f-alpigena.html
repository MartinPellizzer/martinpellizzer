<p>Carex vesicaria f. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bladder sedge, is a variant of the bladder sedge species native to alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
