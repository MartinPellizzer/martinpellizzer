<p>Crepis decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate hawk's-beard, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by pale green or brown bracts. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and it typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Crepis decumbens is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators.</p>
