                    <h1>Cypripedium acaule f. biflorum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium acaule f. biflorum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescence, which sets it apart from the typical single-flowered form of Cypripedium acaule. The plant features a showy, slipper-shaped pouch in its flower, which is adapted to trap pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
