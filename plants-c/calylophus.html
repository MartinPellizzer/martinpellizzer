<p>Calylophus, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Calylophus species are native to various regions in Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
