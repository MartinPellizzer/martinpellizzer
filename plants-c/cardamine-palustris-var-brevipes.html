                    <h1>Cardamine palustris var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Cardamine palustris var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water cress, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
