<p>Carduus affinis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Carduus affinis is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators.</p>
