<p>Coccinia pwaniensis, commonly known as the Pwani leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to a red color.</p>
