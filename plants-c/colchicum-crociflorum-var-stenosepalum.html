                    <h1>Colchicum crociflorum var. stenosepalum</h1>
<p>Colchicum crociflorum var. stenosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with narrow, elongated sepals. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of basal, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinct floral morphology and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations.</p>
