                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora var. neuropetala</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora var. neuropetala, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study.</p>
