                    <h1>Crepidium sororium</h1>
<p>Crepidium sororium, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single leaf and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states.</p>
