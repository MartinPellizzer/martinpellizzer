                    <h1>Cyclosorus mutabilis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable cyclosorus, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that exhibit a unique coloration pattern. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern along the margins of the fronds. Cyclosorus mutabilis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction.</p>
