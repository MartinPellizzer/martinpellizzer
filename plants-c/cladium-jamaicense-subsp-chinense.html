<p>Cladium jamaicense subsp.</p>
<p>chinense, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves with serrated edges, which help in reducing water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>The plant forms dense stands that provide important habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, often forming part of the vegetation in marshes and swamps.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stability of wetland ecosystems.</p>
