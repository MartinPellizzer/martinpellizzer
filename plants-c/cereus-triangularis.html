<p>Cereus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cereus triangularis is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and a slow growth rate.</p>
