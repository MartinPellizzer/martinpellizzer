                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. withaniae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. withaniae, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found growing on crops such as cotton and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a unique example of parasitic adaptation in the plant kingdom.</p>
