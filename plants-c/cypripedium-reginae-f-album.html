                    <h1>Cypripedium reginae f. album</h1>
<p>Cypripedium reginae f. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>This variant of the showy lady's slipper is distinguished by its pale white petals and sepals, which give it a more subdued appearance compared to the typical pink or yellow varieties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many areas.</p>
