                    <h1>Cypripedium × concolawre</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × concolawre, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus (the showy lady's slipper) and Cypripedium pubescens (the yellow lady's slipper), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
