                    <h1>Cephalanthera chartacea</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera chartacea, commonly known as the chartaceous green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their leaf-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera chartacea is known for its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its mycorrhizal partners for energy.</p>
