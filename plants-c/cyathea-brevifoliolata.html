<p>Cyathea brevifoliolata, commonly known as the short-leaved tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyathea brevifoliolata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
