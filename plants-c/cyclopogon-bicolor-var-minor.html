<p>Cyclopogon bicolor var. minor, commonly known as the lesser coralroot, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its striking white and green striped flowers, which are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
