                    <h1>Cypripedium lawrenceanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium lawrenceanum, commonly known as the Lawrence's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a lady's shoe. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
