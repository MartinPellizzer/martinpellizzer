                    <h1>Cormonema sprucei</h1>
<p>Cormonema sprucei, commonly known as the mountain cormonema, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique corm-like underground storage structures, which help it survive in harsh mountainous environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cormonema sprucei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
