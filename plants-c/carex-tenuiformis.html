                    <h1>Carex tenuiformis</h1>
<p>Carex tenuiformis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Carex tenuiformis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
