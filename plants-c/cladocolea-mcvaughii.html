                    <h1>Cladocolea mcvaughii</h1>
<p>Cladocolea mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's cliffbrake, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are adapted to grow in crevices and on cliff faces. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct, often zigzagging pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Cladocolea mcvaughii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
