<p>Cyclorhiza edosmoides, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a long lifespan. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often found in protected natural habitats.</p>
