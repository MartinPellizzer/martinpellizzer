                    <h1>Cystodiopteris</h1>
<p>Cystodiopteris, commonly known as the fern of the Carboniferous period, is a genus of extinct plants that thrived during the late Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, frond-like structures that resemble modern ferns, though it belongs to an ancient lineage of vascular plants. The plant's morphology suggests it had complex vascular systems, allowing for efficient water and nutrient transport. Cystodiopteris fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating its significant role in the ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants and the development of modern plant structures.</p>
