                    <h1>Cheilanthes lendigera</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes lendigera, commonly known as the rock fern or slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of moss-like tissue, which helps it survive in extreme climates.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes lendigera is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well adapted to limestone and granite substrates.</p>
