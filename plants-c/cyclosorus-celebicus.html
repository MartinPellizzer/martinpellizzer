                    <h1>Cyclosorus celebicus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
