                    <h1>Curio articulatus</h1>
<p>Curio articulatus, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a striking succulent native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features long, upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stalks under the right conditions.</p>
<p>Curio articulatus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
