                            <h1>Ceraia Philippinensis</h1>
<p>Philippine ceraia, scientifically known as Ceraia philippinensis, is a rare and endemic freshwater snail found exclusively in the Philippines. This species belongs to the family Planorbidae and is characterized by its small, spiral-shaped shell and delicate body. Despite its modest size, the Philippine ceraia plays a crucial role in its ecosystem as a bioindicator of water quality. Its habitat is limited to specific streams and rivers, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique species from threats such as pollution and habitat destruction.</p>
