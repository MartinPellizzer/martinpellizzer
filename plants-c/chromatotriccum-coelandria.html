<p>Chromatotriccum coelandria, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, perennial moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive golden-yellow coloration, which becomes more prominent as it matures. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often curled at the tips, and it produces spore capsules that are clustered in dense, star-like formations. It is typically found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
