                    <h1>Cyclosorus perpubescens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus perpubescens, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous slender, branching fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus perpubescens plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration activities.</p>
