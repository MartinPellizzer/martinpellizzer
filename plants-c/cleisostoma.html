                    <h1>Cleisostoma</h1>
<p>Cleisostoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Cleisostoma species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a unique, ghostly appearance. They are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleisostoma species are often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>
