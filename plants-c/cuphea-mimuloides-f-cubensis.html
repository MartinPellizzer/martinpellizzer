                    <h1>Cuphea mimuloides f. cubensis</h1>
<p>Cuphea mimuloides f. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban flame flower, is a compact, flowering shrub native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers within the bracts, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its striking appearance and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping and container gardening.</p>
