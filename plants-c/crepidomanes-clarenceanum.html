                    <h1>Crepidomanes clarenceanum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes clarenceanum, commonly known as the Clarencean cliffmoss, is a rare and specialized liverwort that thrives in rocky, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats on vertical surfaces. The plant exhibits a unique thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like growth. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions.</p>
