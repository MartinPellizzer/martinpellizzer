<p>Cycas circinalis subsp.</p>
<p>thouarsii, commonly known as the Tuamotu cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the French Polynesian islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with both male and female cones occurring on the same individual. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in its native environment.</p>
