<p>Cyclosorus melanophlebius, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, delicate fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus melanophlebius plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
