<p>Conomorpha liriensis, commonly known as the Liri River orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces slender, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often a different color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
