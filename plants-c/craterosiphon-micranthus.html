                    <h1>Craterosiphon micranthus</h1>
<p>Craterosiphon micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered rockweed, is a marine green alga that thrives in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a single central axis and small, clustered reproductive structures. It is typically found in temperate coastal regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
