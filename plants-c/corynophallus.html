                    <h1>Corynophallus</h1>
<p>Corynophallus, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a member of the Agaricaceae family and is characterized by its large, spore-filled fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in temperate regions. The fruiting body is initially a dense, white, spongy mass that gradually expands into a rounded, bulbous shape. It lacks a stem and has a smooth, often slightly sticky surface.</p>
<p>The spores are released through a central opening called a stipe, which becomes visible as the fruiting body matures.</p>
