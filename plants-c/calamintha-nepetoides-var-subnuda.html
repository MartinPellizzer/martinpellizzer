<p>Calamintha nepetoides var. subnuda, commonly known as narrow-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic stems that are often hairy and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in terminal spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, and they emit a mint-like fragrance when crushed.</p>
