                    <h1>Cyclosorus cretaceus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus cretaceus, commonly known as the cretaceous cyclosorus, is a rare and ancient fern species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of more primitive ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or calcareous soils. Its spore-producing structures are small and clustered, typical of the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
