                    <h1>Corytholoma igneum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma igneum, commonly known as the firecap mushroom, is a distinctive fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flame-like cap that ranges in color from orange to red, often with a yellowish or reddish stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and often has a slight sheen, contributing to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>This mushroom is not only notable for its striking appearance but also for its ecological role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
