<p>Cruzia serpyllacea, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on lawns and along pathways, often thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Cruzia serpyllacea is also a common weed in cultivated areas due to its hardy nature and rapid spread.</p>
