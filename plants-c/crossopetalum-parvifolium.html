                    <h1>Crossopetalum parvifolium</h1>
<p>Crossopetalum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved crossopetalum, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are borne in clusters and are notable for their vibrant pink to red hues, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid, semi-shaded environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
