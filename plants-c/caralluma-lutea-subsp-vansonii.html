<p>Caralluma lutea subsp.</p>
<p>vansonii, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
