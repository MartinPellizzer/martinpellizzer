<p>Corymbia stockeri subsp.</p>
<p>peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rugged, gnarled trunk and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and drought.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray hue, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous communities for tools and construction.</p>
