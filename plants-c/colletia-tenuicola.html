<p>Colletia tenuicola, commonly known as the slender cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water.</p>
<p>Colletia tenuicola is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
