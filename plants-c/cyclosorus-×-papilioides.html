                    <h1>Cyclosorus × papilioides</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × papilioides, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Cyclosorus and papilio.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant's leaves are rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, creating a visually striking appearance. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, allowing it to spread effectively in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
