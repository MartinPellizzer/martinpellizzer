<p>Castilleja rigida, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are rigid and branching.</p>
<p>Castilleja rigida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
