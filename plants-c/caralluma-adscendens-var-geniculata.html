                    <h1>Caralluma adscendens var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Caralluma adscendens var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a shrub-like structure, often growing in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
