                    <h1>Cuscuta castroviejoi</h1>
<p>Cuscuta castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through fragmentation of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
