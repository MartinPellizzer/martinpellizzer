                    <h1>Carex × limula var. submiliaris</h1>
<p>Carex × limula var. submiliaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a hybrid sedge species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in a tight, cylindrical shape. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in wetland conditions.</p>
