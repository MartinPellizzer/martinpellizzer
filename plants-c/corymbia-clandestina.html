                    <h1>Corymbia clandestina</h1>
<p>Corymbia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that peels away in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The ghost gum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
