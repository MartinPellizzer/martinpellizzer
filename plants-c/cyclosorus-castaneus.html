<p>Cyclosorus castaneus, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces dense clusters of fan-shaped fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus castaneus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
