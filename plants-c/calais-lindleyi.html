                    <h1>Calais lindleyi</h1>
<p>Calais lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne at the ends of the stems. Calais lindleyi has adapted to arid environments through its thick, fleshy stems and reduced leaves, which minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems.</p>
