<p>Calceolaria moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba slipper orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria moyobambae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
