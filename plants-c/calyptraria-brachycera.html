<p>Calyptraria brachycera, commonly known as the short-horned calyptra, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat thallus with a granular surface and a yellowish to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Calyptraria brachycera is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
