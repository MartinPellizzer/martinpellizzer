                    <h1>Cachrys peregrina</h1>
<p>Cachrys peregrina, commonly known as the wandering candleplant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Its common name reflects the way its leaves appear to "wander" across the ground as the plant grows.</p>
<p>Cachrys peregrina is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
