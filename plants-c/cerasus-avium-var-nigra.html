<p>Cerasus avium var. nigra, commonly known as the black cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the standard sweet cherry. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal fruiting.</p>
<p>The black cherry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
