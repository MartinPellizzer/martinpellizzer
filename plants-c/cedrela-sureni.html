<p>Cedrela sureni, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued in the timber industry. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Cedrela sureni is now classified as a vulnerable species.</p>
