                    <h1>Cyperus retrorsus var. typicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus retrorsus var. typicus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
