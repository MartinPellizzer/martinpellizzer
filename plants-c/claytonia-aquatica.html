                    <h1>Claytonia aquatica</h1>
<p>Claytonia aquatica, commonly known as water pimpernel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Claytonia aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
