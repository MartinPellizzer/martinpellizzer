<p>Carpodinus complicata, commonly known as the clustered leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched stems that bear small, fleshy leaves arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
