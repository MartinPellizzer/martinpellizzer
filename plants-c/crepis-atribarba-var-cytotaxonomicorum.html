                    <h1>Crepis atribarba var. cytotaxonomicorum</h1>
<p>Crepis atribarba var. cytotaxonomicorum, commonly known as the cytotaxonomic crepis, is a rare variant of the crepis genus native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct morphology, including narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers. This variant is notable for its unique cytological features, which have led to its classification as a separate taxonomic form. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its study is important for understanding genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within the Crepis genus.</p>
