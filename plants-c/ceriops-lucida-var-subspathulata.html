                    <h1>Ceriops lucida var. subspathulata</h1>
<p>Ceriops lucida var. subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species Ceriops lucida.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has slender, elongated leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, aiding in gas exchange. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones.</p>
<p>This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
