<p>Cinnamomum inunctum var. albosericeum, commonly known as the white silky cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cinnamon plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan province. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost white, silky hairs covering its leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
