<p>Caralluma dicapuae subsp.</p>
<p>ukambensis, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
