<p>Chaptalia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, featuring erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and often have a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Chaptalia ehrenbergii is also known for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus.</p>
