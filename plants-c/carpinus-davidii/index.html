<p>David's hornbeam, scientifically known as Carpinus davidii, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles compared to other hornbeam species.</p>
