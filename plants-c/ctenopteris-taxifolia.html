                    <h1>Ctenopteris taxifolia</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris taxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
