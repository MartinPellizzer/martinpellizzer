                            <h1>Cheilanthes Repens</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes repens, also known as the walking fern, is a unique and resilient plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments. This fern is named for its ability to spread across surfaces, appearing to "walk" as its rhizomes extend and form new growth. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy survivor in challenging climates. The plant's compact size and dense growth pattern make it an excellent choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal have made it a popular subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanists alike.</p>
