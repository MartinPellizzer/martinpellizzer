                    <h1>Copernicia yarey var. yarey</h1>
<p>Copernicia yarey var. yarey, commonly known as the Yarey palm, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a small, ornamental palm characterized by its clustered, feather-like leaves and smooth, grayish trunk. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by the development of coconut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
