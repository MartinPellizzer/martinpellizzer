                    <h1>Cinchona suberosa</h1>
<p>Cinchona suberosa, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it often grows in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its historical use in the production of quinine, though it is less commonly cultivated today compared to other cinchona species.</p>
