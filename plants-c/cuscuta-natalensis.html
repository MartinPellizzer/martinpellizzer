                    <h1>Cuscuta natalensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta natalensis, commonly known as Natal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia or Euphorbia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its environment.</p>
