<p>Canarium maluense f. quadrangulare, commonly known as the quadrangular canarium, is a variant of the canarium species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly leathery texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil.</p>
