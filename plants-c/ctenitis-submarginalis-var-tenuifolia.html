<p>Ctenitis submarginalis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive marginal vein that gives it its specific epithet.</p>
