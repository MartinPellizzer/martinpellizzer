<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, providing structural support for the flowering stems.</p>
<p>Cyanea sylvestris thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and undercanopies where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
