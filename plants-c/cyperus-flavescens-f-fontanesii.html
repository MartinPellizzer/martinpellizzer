                    <h1>Cyperus flavescens f. fontanesii</h1>
<p>Cyperus flavescens f. fontanesii, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively, and it is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>The golden flatsedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
