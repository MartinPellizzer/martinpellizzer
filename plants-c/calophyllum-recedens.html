<p>Calophyllum recedens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Calophyllum recedens is well adapted to saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
