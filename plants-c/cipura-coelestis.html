                    <h1>Cipura coelestis</h1>
<p>Cipura coelestis, commonly known as the skyflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cipura coelestis is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
