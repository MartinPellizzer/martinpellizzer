<p>Combretum laxum var. aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery, orange-red leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing after the leaves have dropped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and drought tolerance.</p>
