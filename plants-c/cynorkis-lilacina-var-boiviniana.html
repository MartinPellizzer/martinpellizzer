                    <h1>Cynorkis lilacina var. boiviniana</h1>
<p>Cynorkis lilacina var. boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in spring, featuring intricate patterns and a unique lip structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
