                    <h1>Cyclosorus parasiticus var. cylindrothrix</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus parasiticus var. cylindrothrix, commonly known as the cylindrical parasitic liverwort, is a member of the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic, epiphytic liverwort that relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, rounded papillae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the bark of trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly through its thallus.</p>
