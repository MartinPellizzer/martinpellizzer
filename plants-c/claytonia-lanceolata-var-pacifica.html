<p>Claytonia lanceolata var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for serpentine soils and its ecological importance to pollinators.</p>
