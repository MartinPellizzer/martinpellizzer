<p>Cupressus abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the cypress family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
