                    <h1>Carex cespitosa var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Carex cespitosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinct midrib running along their length.</p>
