<p>Camissonia heterochroma subsp.</p>
<p>monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Mono Basin, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
