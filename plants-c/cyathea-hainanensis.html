<p>Cyathea hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Cyathea hainanensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
