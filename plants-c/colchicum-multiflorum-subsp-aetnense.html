<p>Colchicum multiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant features a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological adaptation to high-altitude conditions and its role in the local flora of the Mediterranean region.</p>
