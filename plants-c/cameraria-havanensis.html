                    <h1>Cameraria havanensis</h1>
<p>Cameraria havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>Its larvae are leaf-mining insects that feed on the leaves of the evergreen tree *Cordia lutea*, which is native to the Caribbean. The adult moths are tiny, with wingspan less than 5 millimeters, and are typically pale yellow or white in color. The plant's leaves are characterized by their thick, leathery texture and prominent veins, providing a suitable habitat for the larvae.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling through leaf litter.</p>
