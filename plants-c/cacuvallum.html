                    <h1>Cacuvallum</h1>
<p>Cacuvallum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that can span up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Cacuvallum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and helping to stabilize water ecosystems.</p>
