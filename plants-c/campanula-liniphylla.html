<p>Campanula liniphylla, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Campanula liniphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
