                    <h1>Corindum</h1>
<p>Corindum, commonly known as the ruby stone, is not a plant but a mineral.</p>
<p>It is a type of corundum, which is a crystalline form of aluminum oxide. While it is often mistaken for a gemstone, it does not have botanical characteristics. The term "corindum" may be confused with "coriander," which is a flowering plant.</p>
<p>Always verify the correct scientific classification before assuming botanical properties.</p>
