<p>Courbonia brevipilosa, commonly known as the short-hairwood or narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for timber purposes.</p>
