                    <h1>Cogswellia insularis</h1>
<p>Cogswellia insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Cogswellia insularis is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
