                    <h1>Caragana aurantiaca var. deserticola</h1>
<p>Caragana aurantiaca var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert pea or yellow peashrub, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
