<p>Cybianthus jajiensis, commonly known as the Jaji sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Cybianthus jajiensis is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
