                    <h1>Colletoecema gabonensis</h1>
<p>Colletoecema gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Gabon.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
