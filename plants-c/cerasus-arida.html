<p>Cerasus arida, commonly known as the desert cherry, is a species of Prunus native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub or tree that thrives in hot, dry climates with limited water availability. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
