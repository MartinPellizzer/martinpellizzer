<p>Capsicum vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species of chili pepper native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that typically range in color from yellow to orange when ripe. The plant produces small white flowers and has hairy stems, typical of many Capsicum species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown in gardens for its unique flavor and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and cultivation, it is not widely available in commercial markets.</p>
