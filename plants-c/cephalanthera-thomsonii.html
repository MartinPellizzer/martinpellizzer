                    <h1>Cephalanthera thomsonii</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a striking inflorescence of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble a cascade of small, delicate trusses. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it obtains most of its nutrients through a symbiotic relationship with fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
