                    <h1>Cheilanthes pygmaea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature rock fern, is a small, hardy fern species native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered near the leaf margins. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
