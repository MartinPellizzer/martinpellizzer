                    <h1>Cryosophila cookii</h1>
<p>Cryosophila cookii, commonly known as the Cook's cryosophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme cold and high UV radiation, showcasing specialized morphological features such as dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming during the short summer months. Its growth is limited to specific microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Cryosophila cookii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
