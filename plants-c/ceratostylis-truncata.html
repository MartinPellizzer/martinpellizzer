                    <h1>Ceratostylis truncata</h1>
<p>Ceratostylis truncata, commonly known as the truncated club-moss, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Microsorum, and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the leaf sheaths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
