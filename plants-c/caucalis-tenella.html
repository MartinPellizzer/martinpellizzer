<p>Caucalis tenella, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
