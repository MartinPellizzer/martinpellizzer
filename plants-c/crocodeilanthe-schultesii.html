<p>Crocodeilanthe schultesii, commonly known as the crocodile fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found growing on trees or rocks in dense forest canopies.</p>
