The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, sticky, spherical seed capsules. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
