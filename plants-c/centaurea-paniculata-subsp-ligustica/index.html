                            <h1>Centaurea Paniculata Subsp. Ligustica</h1>
<p>Centaurea paniculata subsp. ligustica is a striking member of the Asteraceae family known for its vibrant blue to purple flower heads. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its slender stems and delicate foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and supporting local biodiversity. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to avoid becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
