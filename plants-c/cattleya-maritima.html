<p>Cattleya maritima, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray from the ocean. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in its arid, coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Cattleya maritima is also noted for its unique growth habit, with long, narrow leaves and a compact, upright structure.</p>
