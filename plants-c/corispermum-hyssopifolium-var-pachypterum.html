                    <h1>Corispermum hyssopifolium var. pachypterum</h1>
<p>Corispermum hyssopifolium var. pachypterum, commonly known as the thick-winged bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salinity soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is part of the family Brassicaceae and exhibits specialized adaptations for survival in extreme conditions.</p>
