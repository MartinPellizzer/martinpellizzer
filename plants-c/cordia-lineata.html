<p>Cordia lineata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Cordia lineata is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in crafting and as a source of aromatic resin.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
