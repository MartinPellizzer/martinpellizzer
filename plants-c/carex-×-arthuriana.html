                    <h1>Carex × arthuriana</h1>
<p>Carex × arthuriana, commonly known as the Arthur's sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. This plant is typically found in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, where it thrives in full to partial sun. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-angled, spike-like structures that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
