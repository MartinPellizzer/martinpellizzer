<p>Chaetospora capitellum, commonly known as the purple sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky substrates, often in shallow, tide-pooled areas. The plant has a simple, blade-like structure with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Its reproductive structures, called conceptacles, are embedded within the thallus and produce gametes for sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Chaetospora capitellum plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
