<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides.</p>
