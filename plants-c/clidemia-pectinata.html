                    <h1>Clidemia pectinata</h1>
<p>Clidemia pectinata, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of other woody plants, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are usually white or pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
