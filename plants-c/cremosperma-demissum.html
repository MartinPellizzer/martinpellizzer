<p>Cremosperma demissum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low, sprawling growth habit, featuring succulent stems and narrow, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cremosperma demissum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats.</p>
