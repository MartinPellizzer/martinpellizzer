                    <h1>Calanthe caudatilabella var. latiloba</h1>
<p>Calanthe caudatilabella var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved tail orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
