                    <h1>Calophanes capitatus</h1>
<p>Calophanes capitatus, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a yellowish to orange-brown thallus with distinct, star-shaped lobes that give it its common name. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
