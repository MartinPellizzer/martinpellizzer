                    <h1>Chamaeangis odoratissima</h1>
<p>Chamaeangis odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are linear and densely packed, forming a rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
