                    <h1>Carex pulla f. debilis</h1>
<p>Carex pulla f. debilis, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a variant of the Carex pulla species, characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
