                    <h1>Carex continua</h1>
<p>Carex continua, commonly known as the continuous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex continua is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.</p>
