                    <h1>Cheilanthes viridis var. glauca</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viridis var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
