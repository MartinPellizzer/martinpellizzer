                    <h1>Carex terrae-novae</h1>
<p>Carex terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova sedge, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along shorelines and in wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>
