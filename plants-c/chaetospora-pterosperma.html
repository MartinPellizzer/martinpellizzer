                    <h1>Chaetospora pterosperma</h1>
<p>Chaetospora pterosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
