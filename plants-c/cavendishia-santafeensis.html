<p>Cavendishia santafeensis, commonly known as the Santa Fe cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cavendishia santafeensis is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
