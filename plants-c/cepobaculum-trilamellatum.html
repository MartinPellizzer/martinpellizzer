                    <h1>Cepobaculum trilamellatum</h1>
<p>Cepobaculum trilamellatum, commonly known as the three-layered bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small prey, aiding in its nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant exhibits a filamentous growth form with multicellular structures that facilitate both photosynthesis and predation. Its morphology includes three distinct lamellae, which contribute to its classification and ecological function.</p>
<p>Cepobaculum trilamellatum is typically found in freshwater habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
