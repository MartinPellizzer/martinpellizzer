                    <h1>Carex globularis var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Carex globularis var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse globular sedge, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers in the spring, which are followed by three-sided, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects.</p>
