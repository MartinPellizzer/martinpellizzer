                    <h1>Cuscuta harperi</h1>
<p>Cuscuta harperi, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination and attachment to a host via haustoria. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various herbaceous plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta harperi plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant populations.</p>
