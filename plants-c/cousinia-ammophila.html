                    <h1>Cousinia ammophila</h1>
<p>Cousinia ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming growth that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia ammophila plays a role in preventing soil erosion and is often found in coastal and desert dunes.</p>
