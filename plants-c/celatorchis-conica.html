                    <h1>Celatorchis conica</h1>
<p>Celatorchis conica, commonly known as the conical cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that grows in a spiral or helical pattern, giving it a distinctive conical shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Celatorchis conica is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
