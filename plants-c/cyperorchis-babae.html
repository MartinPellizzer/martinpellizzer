                    <h1>Cyperorchis babae</h1>
<p>Cyperorchis babae, commonly known as the Babae sedge orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, grass-like leaves are adapted to low-light conditions, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyperorchis babae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
