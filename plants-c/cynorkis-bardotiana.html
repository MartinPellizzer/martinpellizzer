                    <h1>Cynorkis bardotiana</h1>
<p>Cynorkis bardotiana, commonly known as the Bardot's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
