                    <h1>Calobota saharae</h1>
<p>Calobota saharae, commonly known as the Saharan calobota, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and striking, tubular flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its blooming period typically occurs during the brief rainy season, making it a unique and ephemeral sight in the desert landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calobota saharae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
