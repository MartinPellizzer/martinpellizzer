                    <h1>Clerodendrum urticifolium</h1>
<p>Clerodendrum urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of stinging nettle, though it does not produce the irritant hairs found in true nettles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions make it a common weed in many areas.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
