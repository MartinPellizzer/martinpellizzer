<p>Calligonum × pseudodubjanskyi, commonly known as the hybrid tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum balchanii and Calligonum pseudodubjanskyi, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, scale-like leaves adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This species is often found in saline soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
