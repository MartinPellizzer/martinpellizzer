<p>Cachrys cryptodiscua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green, leafless stems and clusters of small, white or greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>Cachrys cryptodiscua is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of pine forests.</p>
