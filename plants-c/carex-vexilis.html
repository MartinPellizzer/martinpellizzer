<p>Carex vexilis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.
