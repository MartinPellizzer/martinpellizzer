                    <h1>Chaetolepis alpestris</h1>
<p>Chaetolepis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to colonize alpine environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
