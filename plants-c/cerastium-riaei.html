                    <h1>Cerastium riaei</h1>
<p>Cerastium riaei, commonly known as the coastal chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky soils and gravelly shores, thriving in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cerastium riaei is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it an important component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
