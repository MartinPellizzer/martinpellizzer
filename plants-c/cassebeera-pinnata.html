                    <h1>Cassebeera pinnata</h1>
<p>Cassebeera pinnata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Cassebeera pinnata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
