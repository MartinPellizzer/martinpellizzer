<p>Cyclosorus lucidus, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus lucidus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
