                    <h1>Cylindropyrum</h1>
<p>Cylindropyrum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a club. Cylindropyrum species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes a dominant gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they provide important insights into the evolution of vascular plants.</p>
