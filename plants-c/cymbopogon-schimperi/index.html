                            <h1>Cymbopogon Schimperi</h1>
<p>Peru grass, scientifically known as Cymbopogon schimperi, is a hardy perennial grass native to the highlands of Ethiopia and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fragrant, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive citrusy scent. This versatile plant is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it a valuable crop for sustainable agriculture in arid environments. Due to its unique properties, Peru grass has gained attention for potential applications in essential oils, herbal remedies, and ecological restoration.</p>
