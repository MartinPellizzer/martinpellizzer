<p>Chamelaucium axillare, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that typically bloom in winter and spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitat. It produces small, woody follicles that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Chamelaucium axillare is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
