                    <h1>Calanthe triplicata f. albolineata</h1>
<p>Calanthe triplicata f. albolineata, commonly known as the white-lined calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white veins that run along the pale green to white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on the forest floor. Its flowers are small but numerous, forming dense clusters that add to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
