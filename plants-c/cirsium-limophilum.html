                    <h1>Cirsium limophilum</h1>
<p>Cirsium limophilum, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cirsium limophilum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
