                    <h1>Cardiopteris rumphii var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Cardiopteris rumphii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
