<p>Calligonum mongolicum var. gobicum, commonly known as the Gobi calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
