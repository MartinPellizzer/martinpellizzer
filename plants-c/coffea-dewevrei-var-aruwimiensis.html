                    <h1>Coffea dewevrei var. aruwimiensis</h1>
<p>Coffea dewevrei var. aruwimiensis, commonly known as the Aruwimi coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests, requiring high levels of rainfall and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a moderate size, and it has a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in the wild.</p>
