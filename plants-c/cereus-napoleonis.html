<p>Cereus napoleonis, commonly known as the Napoleon's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are covered in fine, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
