                    <h1>Cheilanthes argentea var. obscura</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes argentea var. obscura, commonly known as the silver frilled fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in silvery, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often on cliffs or in crevices where it can retain moisture. It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form, obscura, is distinguished by its darker, more subdued coloration compared to the typical silver frilled fern.</p>
