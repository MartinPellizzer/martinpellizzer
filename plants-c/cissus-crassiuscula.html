                    <h1>Cissus crassiuscula</h1>
<p>Cissus crassiuscula, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing or trailing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate dry periods.</p>
