                    <h1>Cycnogeton lineare</h1>
<p>Cycnogeton lineare, commonly known as the linear water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Cycnogeton lineare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
