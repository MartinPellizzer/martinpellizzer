<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and slender, often branched stems. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja inornata plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics through its parasitic relationship with other vegetation.</p>
