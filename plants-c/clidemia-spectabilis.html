<p>Clidemia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, white or pinkish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as mangroves and hardwoods, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its small, elliptical leaves are often clustered at the ends of its branches, creating a dense, shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>Clidemia spectabilis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
