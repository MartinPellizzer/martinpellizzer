                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis f. protrusa</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis f. protrusa, commonly known as the fragrant brittle fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form, f. protrusa, distinguishes itself through its slightly larger and more robust fronds compared to the typical form.</p>
