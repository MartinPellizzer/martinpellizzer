                    <h1>Crataegus depressa</h1>
<p>Crataegus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 feet and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called pomes in the fall. Crataegus depressa is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant landscaping.</p>
