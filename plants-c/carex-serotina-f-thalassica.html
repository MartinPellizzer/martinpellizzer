                    <h1>Carex serotina f. thalassica</h1>
<p>Carex serotina f. thalassica, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a variant of the common sedges found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is adapted to coastal and brackish conditions, often growing in marshes and tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in these dynamic habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
