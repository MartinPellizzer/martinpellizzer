                    <h1>Chlaenobolus rugosus</h1>
<p>Chlaenobolus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-spored earthstar, is a unique member of the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a lichen that forms a distinctive, star-like structure with a central stalk and a fleshy, lobed upper part. The plant's thallus is typically crustose, with a rough, uneven surface that gives it its common name. It is often found on rocks and soil in moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind and contribute to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
