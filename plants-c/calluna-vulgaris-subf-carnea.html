<p>Calluna vulgaris subf.</p>
<p>carnea, commonly known as the pink heather, is a subshrub native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive pink to red floral display, which appears in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in heathland and moorland environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
