                    <h1>Croton lotorius</h1>
<p>Croton lotorius, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
