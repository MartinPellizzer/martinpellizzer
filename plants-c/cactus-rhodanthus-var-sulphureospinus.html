                    <h1>Cactus rhodanthus var. sulphureospinus</h1>
<p>Cactus rhodanthus var. sulphureospinus, commonly known as the yellow spiny cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, yellowish spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
