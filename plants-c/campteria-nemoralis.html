                    <h1>Campteria nemoralis</h1>
<p>Campteria nemoralis, commonly known as the wood sparrow's foot or the lesser wood sparrow's foot, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as woodland edges and grassy areas. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its seed pods are slender and twisted, a characteristic feature of the genus Campteria. It has small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, and it is often found in the understorey of forests in Europe.</p>
<p>Campteria nemoralis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
