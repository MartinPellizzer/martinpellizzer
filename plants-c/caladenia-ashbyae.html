                    <h1>Caladenia ashbyae</h1>
<p>Caladenia ashbyae, commonly known as the Ashby's spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family found in the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows to a height of about 20â€“30 centimeters, featuring a single, slender stem topped with a single, intricately shaped flower. The flower is characterized by its vivid red and yellow coloration, with a distinctive spider-like appearance due to its long, narrow petals and sepals. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Caladenia ashbyae is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare botanical species.</p>
