                    <h1>Calamagrostis griffithiana</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-blue in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
