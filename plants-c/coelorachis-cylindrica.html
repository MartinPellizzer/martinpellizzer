                    <h1>Coelorachis cylindrica</h1>
<p>Coelorachis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Coelorachis cylindrica is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, with a morphology that reflects its evolutionary history from early land plants.</p>
