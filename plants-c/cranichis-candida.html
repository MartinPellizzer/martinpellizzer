<p>Cranichis candida, commonly known as the white orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and a slender, erect stem that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
