                    <h1>Calligonum molle</h1>
<p>Calligonum molle, commonly known as flexible saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its woody stems are highly branched and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Calligonum molle is well adapted to saline soils and is often used for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
