                    <h1>Coleataenia caricoides</h1>
<p>Coleataenia caricoides, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Coleataenia caricoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions.</p>
