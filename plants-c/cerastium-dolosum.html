<p>Cerastium dolosum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover.</p>
