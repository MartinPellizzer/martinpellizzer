                    <h1>Clercia</h1>
<p>Clercia, commonly known as the bluebell or wild bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Clercia species typically produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Clercia plants are often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the biodiversity of their native habitats.</p>
