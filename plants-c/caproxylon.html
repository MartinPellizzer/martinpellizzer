                    <h1>Caproxylon</h1>
<p>Caproxylon, commonly known as the ancient tree fern, is a fossilized plant that dates back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds and a central trunk, which are preserved in coal deposits. The plant's structure suggests it was a large, vascular fern with a complex root system. Caproxylon played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution of plant life during prehistoric times.</p>
