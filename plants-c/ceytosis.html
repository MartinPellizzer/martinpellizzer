                    <h1>Ceytosis</h1>
<p>Ceytosis, commonly known as a type of cell division, is a fundamental process in plant biology.</p>
<p>It involves the division of a single cell into two daughter cells, ensuring growth, development, and tissue repair in plants. This process is regulated by the cell cycle and involves the replication of genetic material followed by the separation of chromosomes. In plants, ceytosis occurs in both meristematic and differentiated cells, contributing to the plant's ability to grow and adapt.</p>
<p>The botanical study of ceytosis is crucial for understanding plant development and genetic inheritance.</p>
