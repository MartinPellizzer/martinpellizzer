                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. anceps</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. anceps, commonly known as the rock spurge or desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and leathery, spore-bearing fronds. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and well-drained soils, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
