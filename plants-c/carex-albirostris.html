                    <h1>Carex albirostris</h1>
<p>Carex albirostris, commonly known as the white-beaked sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>Carex albirostris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
