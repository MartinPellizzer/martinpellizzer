<p>Corion halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant's root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Corion halophilum thrives in coastal areas, salt lakes, and other saline soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
