<p>Cladium ponapense, commonly known as the Pohnpei paper plant, is a species of sedge native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant typically thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in tidal zones or along the edges of lagoons. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetland areas, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
<p>Cladium ponapense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
