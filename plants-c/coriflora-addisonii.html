<p>Coriflora addisonii, commonly known as the Addison's coriflora, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coriflora addisonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
