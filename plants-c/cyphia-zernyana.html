                    <h1>Cyphia zernyana</h1>
<p>Cyphia zernyana, commonly known as the Zernyana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cyphia zernyana is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
