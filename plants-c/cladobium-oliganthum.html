                    <h1>Cladobium oliganthum</h1>
<p>Cladobium oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses chlorophyll and can perform partial photosynthesis, but it also derives nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Cladobium oliganthum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
