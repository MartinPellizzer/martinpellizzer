                    <h1>Chondrosea vandellii</h1>
<p>Chondrosea vandellii, commonly known as the Vandell's sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
