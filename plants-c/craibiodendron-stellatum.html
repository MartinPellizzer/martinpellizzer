                    <h1>Craibiodendron stellatum</h1>
<p>Craibiodendron stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often star-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces small white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
