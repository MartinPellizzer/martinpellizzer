                    <h1>Coelogyne alvinlokii</h1>
<p>Coelogyne alvinlokii, commonly known as the Alvin Lok's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Its leaves are strap-like and革质, providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelogyne alvinlokii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
