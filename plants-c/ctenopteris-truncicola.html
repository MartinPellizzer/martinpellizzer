                    <h1>Ctenopteris truncicola</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris truncicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often serrated fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in coastal and brackish water environments, making it well adapted to saline conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris truncicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
