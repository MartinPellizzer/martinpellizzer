<p>Commicarpus squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy bladder nut, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by inflated, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
