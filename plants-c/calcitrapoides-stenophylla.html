                    <h1>Calcitrapoides stenophylla</h1>
<p>Calcitrapoides stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calcitrap, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions with unique geological conditions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to low-nutrient environments. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain ecological studies.</p>
