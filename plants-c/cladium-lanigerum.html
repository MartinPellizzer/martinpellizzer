                    <h1>Cladium lanigerum</h1>
<p>Cladium lanigerum, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense stands that contribute to the structure of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Cladium lanigerum plays an important role in providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>
