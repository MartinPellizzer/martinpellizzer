The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but showy, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
