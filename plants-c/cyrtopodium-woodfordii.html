                    <h1>Cyrtopodium woodfordii</h1>
<p>Cyrtopodium woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
