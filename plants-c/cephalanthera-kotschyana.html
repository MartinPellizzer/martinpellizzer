                    <h1>Cephalanthera kotschyana</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and a long, spiraling inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
