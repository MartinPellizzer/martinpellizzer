                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a small, delicate fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm long, with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. The fronds are fragile and often break easily, giving the plant its common name. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
