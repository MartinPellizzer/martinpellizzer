<p>Celsia barnadesii subsp.</p>
<p>floccosa, commonly known as the woolly celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native region.</p>
