                    <h1>Ceratobium</h1>
<p>Ceratobium, commonly known as the "dwarf hair grass," is a genus of small, tufted grasses native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have slender, wiry stems with fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Ceratobium species are characterized by their compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in early spring.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicator species for wetland habitats and their ecological value to invertebrates.</p>
