<p>Chaenactis gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's rayhead, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in New Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
