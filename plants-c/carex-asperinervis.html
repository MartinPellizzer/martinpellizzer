<p>Carex asperinervis, commonly known as the rough-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff, prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically greenish or brownish in color, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Carex asperinervis is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
