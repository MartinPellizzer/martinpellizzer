                    <h1>Caltha palustris var. minima</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist meadows in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and early blooming habit, it is a valuable plant for pollinators and adds visual interest to wetland gardens.</p>
