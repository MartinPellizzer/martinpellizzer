<p>Chaetochloa germanica, commonly known as German hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland areas.</p>
