                    <h1>Caralluma arenicola</h1>
<p>Caralluma arenicola, commonly known as the sand carpet or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma arenicola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including weight management and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
