<p>Carex repens var. laggeri, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three-stamened flowers, typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly rough surface.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks.</p>
