<p>Calligonum rubidum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fleshy, succulent leaves help it retain water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Calligonum rubidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
