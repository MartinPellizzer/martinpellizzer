<p>Cocos cocoyule, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a fibrous husk surrounding its hard, woody shell, which contains the coconut water and the white, fleshy endosperm. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves and flowers that develop into clusters of fruits. Its root system is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The coconut palm is valued for its versatile products, including oil, fiber, and food.</p>
