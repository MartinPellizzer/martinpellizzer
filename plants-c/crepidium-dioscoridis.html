                    <h1>Crepidium dioscoridis</h1>
<p>Crepidium dioscoridis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
