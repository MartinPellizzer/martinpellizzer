                            <h1>Canthium Verticillatum</h1>
<p>Whorled caper, scientifically known as Canthium verticillatum, is a unique and resilient plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. This shrub is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into fleshy, edible fruits. Despite its modest appearance, the whorled caper holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
