                    <h1>Comanthera caespitosa</h1>
<p>Comanthera caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, cushion-like growths on rocky substrates, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant's structure is characterized by a dark, crusty thallus that can vary in color from greenish to reddish depending on environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
