<p>Ceodes grandis, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Ceodes grandis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
