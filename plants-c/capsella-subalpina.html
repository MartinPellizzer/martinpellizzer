<p>Capsella subalpina, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Capsella subalpina is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
