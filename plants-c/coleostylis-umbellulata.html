                    <h1>Coleostylis umbellulata</h1>
<p>Coleostylis umbellulata, commonly known as the clustered star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a characteristic feature of the Cyperaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Coleostylis umbellulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
