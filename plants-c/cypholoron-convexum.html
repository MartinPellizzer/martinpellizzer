<p>Cypholoron convexum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on bark or soil in moist, shaded environments. The thallus of Cypholoron convexum is foliose, with a leathery texture and a distinct, convex shape. It lacks true leaves but has a complex system of filaments called rhizines that anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
