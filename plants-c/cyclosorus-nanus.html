<p>Cyclosorus nanus, commonly known as the small cyclosorus, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically less than 1 cm in size. This plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus nanus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
