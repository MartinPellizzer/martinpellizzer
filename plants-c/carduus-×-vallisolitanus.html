<p>Carduus × vallisolitanus, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carduus nutans (woolly thistle) and Carduus crispus (curled thistle), resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The species is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in disturbed soils and grasslands, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of variability in growth form and floral structure.</p>
