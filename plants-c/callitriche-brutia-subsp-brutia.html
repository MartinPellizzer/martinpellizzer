<p>Callitriche brutia subsp.</p>
<p>brutia, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a delicate, branching structure. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, usually in whorls, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
