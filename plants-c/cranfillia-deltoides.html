                    <h1>Cranfillia deltoides</h1>
<p>Cranfillia deltoides, commonly known as the deltoid cranfillia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a rosette formation that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
