                    <h1>Cyrtococcum chaetophoron</h1>
<p>Cyrtococcum chaetophoron, commonly known as the hairy crust lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, hairy texture on its upper surface. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrition. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
