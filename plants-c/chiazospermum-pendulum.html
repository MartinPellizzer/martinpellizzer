                    <h1>Chiazospermum pendulum</h1>
<p>Chiazospermum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging chia seed plant, is a unique species native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features elongated, pendulous stems that bear clusters of small, capsule-like fruits. The plant produces seeds that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, similar to traditional chia seeds. Its structure allows it to thrive in low-water environments by reducing surface area exposed to the sun.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Chiazospermum pendulum make it an interesting subject for both ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
