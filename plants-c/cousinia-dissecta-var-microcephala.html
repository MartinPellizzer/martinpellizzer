                    <h1>Cousinia dissecta var. microcephala</h1>
<p>Cousinia dissecta var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often dissected into fine lobes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
