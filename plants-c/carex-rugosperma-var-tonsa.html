                    <h1>Carex rugosperma var. tonsa</h1>
<p>Carex rugosperma var. tonsa, commonly known as the rough-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetland or riparian habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
