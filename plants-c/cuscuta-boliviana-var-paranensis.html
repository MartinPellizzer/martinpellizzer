                    <h1>Cuscuta boliviana var. paranensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta boliviana var. paranensis, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host plants and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that coil around its host. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is often found in arid regions and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees.</p>
