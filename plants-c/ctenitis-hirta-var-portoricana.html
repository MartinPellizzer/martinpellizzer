<p>Ctenitis hirta var. portoricana, commonly known as the Portorican holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value has made it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike.</p>
