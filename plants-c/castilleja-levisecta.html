                    <h1>Castilleja levisecta</h1>
<p>Castilleja levisecta, commonly known as the desert paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Castilleja levisecta plays a role in pollination by attracting hummingbirds and bees with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
