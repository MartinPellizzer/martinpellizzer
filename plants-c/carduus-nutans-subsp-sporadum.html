<p>Carduus nutans subsp.</p>
<p>sporadum, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and a single, showy purple flower head that nods downward, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies sporadum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter, more upright stem compared to the typical form of Carduus nutans.</p>
