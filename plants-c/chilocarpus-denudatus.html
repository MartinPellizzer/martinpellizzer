                    <h1>Chilocarpus denudatus</h1>
<p>Chilocarpus denudatus, commonly known as the naked chilocarpus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, woody fruits that contain single seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
