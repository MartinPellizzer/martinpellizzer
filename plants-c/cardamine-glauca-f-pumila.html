                    <h1>Cardamine glauca f. pumila</h1>
<p>Cardamine glauca f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water crowfoot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and forested areas where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of invertebrates and serving as a host plant for certain butterflies.</p>
