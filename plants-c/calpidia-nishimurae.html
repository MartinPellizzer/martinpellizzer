<p>Calpidia nishimurae, commonly known as the Nishimura's calpidia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to a limited region in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Calpidia nishimurae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in its native ecosystem.</p>
