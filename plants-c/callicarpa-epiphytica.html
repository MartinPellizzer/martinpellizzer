                    <h1>Callicarpa epiphytica</h1>
<p>Callicarpa epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches as an epiphyte. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Callicarpa epiphytica is characterized by its lack of a woody stem and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ornamental berries make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
