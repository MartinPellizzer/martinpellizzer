<p>Cenchrus macrostachyus, commonly known as giant sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stature, with slender, wiry stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and fibrous, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cenchrus macrostachyus is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
