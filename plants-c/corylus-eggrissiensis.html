<p>Corylus eggrissiensis, commonly known as the egg-shaped hazelnut, is a rare species of hazel native to a limited region in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive egg-shaped nuts, which are encased in a thick, hairy husk. The plant typically grows in forested areas with well-drained soil and a temperate climate. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and it produces yellowish-green catkins in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corylus eggrissiensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
