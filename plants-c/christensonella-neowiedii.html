                    <h1>Christensonella neowiedii</h1>
<p>Christensonella neowiedii, commonly known as the Neowied's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, fleshy roots help it absorb moisture from the humid air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
