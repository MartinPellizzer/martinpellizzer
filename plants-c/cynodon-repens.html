                    <h1>Cynodon repens</h1>
<p>Cynodon repens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common lawn grass in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to regenerate quickly after grazing or mowing makes it an important forage crop in many regions.</p>
