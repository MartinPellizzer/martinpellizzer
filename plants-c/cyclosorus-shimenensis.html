                    <h1>Cyclosorus shimenensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus shimenensis, commonly known as the Shimen water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with muddy bottoms. Its reproductive structures include tiny, submerged flowers that produce both male and female gametes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus shimenensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
