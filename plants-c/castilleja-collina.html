                    <h1>Castilleja collina</h1>
<p>Castilleja collina, commonly known as the Sierra Indian Paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Castilleja collina plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
