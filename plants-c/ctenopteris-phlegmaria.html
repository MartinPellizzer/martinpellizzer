<p>Ctenopteris phlegmaria, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with sporangia clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its fronds are often described as having a leathery texture and a distinctive, almost metallic sheen.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris phlegmaria thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
