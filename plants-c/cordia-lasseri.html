                    <h1>Cordia lasseri</h1>
<p>Cordia lasseri, commonly known as the desert cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Cordia lasseri is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
