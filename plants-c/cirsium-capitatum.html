<p>Cirsium capitatum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and dense, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically composed of both ray and disk florets, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cirsium capitatum is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
