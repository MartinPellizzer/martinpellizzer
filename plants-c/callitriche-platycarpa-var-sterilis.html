                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile broad-fruit water-starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, floating or submerged leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, often borne in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>The variety 'sterilis' is distinguished by its reduced fertility, making it less likely to produce viable seeds compared to other variants of the species.</p>
