                    <h1>Chenopodium quinoa var. orbicans</h1>
<p>Chenopodium quinoa var. orbicans, commonly known as Bolivian quinoa, is a wild relative of the domesticated quinoa species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. This variety is characterized by its orbiculate (rounded) leaves and small, edible seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving quinoa resilience and yield.</p>
