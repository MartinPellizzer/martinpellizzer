<p>Camissonia sierrae subsp.</p>
<p>alticola, commonly known as the Sierra Valley camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-elevation grasslands of California. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. It is typically found in open, rocky areas and is often associated with other endemic flora of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
