<p>Campanula rotundifolia var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are round or heart-shaped, with a thick, waxy coating to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant.</p>
