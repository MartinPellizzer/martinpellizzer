                    <h1>Cercouratea verruculosa</h1>
<p>Cercouratea verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are covered in small, rough projections, giving it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, forming dense colonies that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Cercouratea verruculosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration processes.</p>
