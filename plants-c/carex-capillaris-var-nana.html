                    <h1>Carex capillaris var. nana</h1>
<p>Carex capillaris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to moist, shady environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in wet or damp soil and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
