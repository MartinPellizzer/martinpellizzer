                    <h1>Campylobotrys</h1>
<p>Campylobotrys, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has bright green, arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces showy purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate can lead to ecological imbalances by blocking sunlight and reducing oxygen levels in water.</p>
<p>Campylobotrys is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
