                    <h1>Calamagrostis nutans</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis nutans, commonly known as the nodding sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green florets that droop downward, giving it a graceful appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis nutans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other wet habitats.</p>
