                    <h1>Cyphia glandulifera f. subcuspidata</h1>
<p>Cyphia glandulifera f. subcuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Cyphia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, glandular-stemmed structure and its distinctive, subcuspidate (slightly toothed) leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
