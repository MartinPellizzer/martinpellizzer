                    <h1>Crepidomanes melanotrichum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes melanotrichum, commonly known as the black-haired sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, dark hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes melanotrichum is often found in disturbed or open habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its native range.</p>
