                    <h1>Cyperus litoreus</h1>
<p>Cyperus litoreus, commonly known as salt marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus litoreus plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
