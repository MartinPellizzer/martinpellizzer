                    <h1>Carex laevirostris var. friesii</h1>
<p>Carex laevirostris var. friesii, commonly known as the Fries' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and slightly glossy, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other sedges.</p>
