                    <h1>Cryophytum pentagonum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum pentagonum, commonly known as the five-sided snowplant, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pentagonal leaf structure, which is adapted to withstand extreme cold and high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its snowy environment. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to retain moisture in arid, frost-prone habitats.</p>
<p>Cryophytum pentagonum is a fascinating example of botanical adaptation to harsh mountain climates.</p>
