<p>Cyclosorus dehuaensis, commonly known as the Dehua water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
