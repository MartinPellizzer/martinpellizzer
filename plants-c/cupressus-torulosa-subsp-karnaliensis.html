<p>Cupressus torulosa subsp.</p>
<p>karnaliensis, commonly known as the Karnali cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
