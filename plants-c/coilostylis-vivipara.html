                    <h1>Coilostylis vivipara</h1>
<p>Coilostylis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where young plants develop on the surface of the parent plant's stems before detaching. Coilostylis vivipara typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.</p>
