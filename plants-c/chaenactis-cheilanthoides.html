                    <h1>Chaenactis cheilanthoides</h1>
<p>Chaenactis cheilanthoides, commonly known as the desert composite or rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is typically found in rocky, arid environments, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Its basal rosette of silver-green leaves helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
