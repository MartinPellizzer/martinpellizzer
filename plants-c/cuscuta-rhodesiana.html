                    <h1>Cuscuta rhodesiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rhodesiana, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plant through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that twines around its host.</p>
<p>Cuscuta rhodesiana is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants, including crops, and can be a significant agricultural pest.</p>
