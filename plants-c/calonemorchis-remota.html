The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in association with specific host trees. Its reproductive system relies on specialized symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
