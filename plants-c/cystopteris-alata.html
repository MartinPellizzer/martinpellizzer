<p>Cystopteris alata, commonly known as the spreading water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Cystopteris alata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic and bog gardens.</p>
