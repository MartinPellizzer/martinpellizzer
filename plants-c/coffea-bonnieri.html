                    <h1>Coffea bonnieri</h1>
<p>Coffea bonnieri, commonly known as the Bonnier coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing two seeds. These seeds are used to make coffee, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important subject for research into coffee genetics and biodiversity.</p>
