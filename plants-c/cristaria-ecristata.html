<p>Cristaria ecristata, commonly known as the spire-moss, is a rare and delicate species of moss found in specific, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its slender, spiral-shaped shoots. The plant forms dense, cushion-like colonies that thrive in shaded, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are released in small, cup-like structures called peristomes, which aid in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cristaria ecristata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
