<p>Cryptosorus obliquatus, commonly known as the slant-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four segments, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Cryptosorus obliquatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
