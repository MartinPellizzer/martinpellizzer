                    <h1>Cynoctonum floribundum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum floribundum, commonly known as the flowering cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its ancient lineage and distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy bark, and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
