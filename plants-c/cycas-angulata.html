                    <h1>Cycas angulata</h1>
<p>Cycas angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas angulata is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
