<p>Cotyledon ergleri, commonly known as the Turkish ice plant, is a succulent plant native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cotyledon ergleri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
