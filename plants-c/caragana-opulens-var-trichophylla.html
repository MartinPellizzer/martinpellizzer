                    <h1>Caragana opulens var. trichophylla</h1>
<p>Caragana opulens var. trichophylla, commonly known as the silky peashrub, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a soft, silky texture. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>The variety trichophylla is distinguished by its unique leaf pubescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
