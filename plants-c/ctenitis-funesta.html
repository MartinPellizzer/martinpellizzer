                    <h1>Ctenitis funesta</h1>
<p>Ctenitis funesta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green or almost white, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ctenitis funesta is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
