                    <h1>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis var. glauca</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
