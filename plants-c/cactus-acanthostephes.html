                    <h1>Cactus acanthostephes</h1>
<p>Cactus acanthostephes, commonly known as the desert hedge cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, succulent body. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb water after rainfall.</p>
<p>Overall, it is well-suited to harsh desert environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
