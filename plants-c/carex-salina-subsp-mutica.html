<p>Carex salina subsp.</p>
<p>mutica, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to sediment retention.</p>
