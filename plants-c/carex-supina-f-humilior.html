                    <h1>Carex supina f. humilior</h1>
<p>Carex supina f. humilior, commonly known as the low-growing sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, Carex supina.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex supina, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces or naturalized areas.</p>
