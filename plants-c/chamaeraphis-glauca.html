                    <h1>Chamaeraphis glauca</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis glauca, commonly known as sea barley or glasswort, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through wind pollination.</p>
<p>Chamaeraphis glauca is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals from the environment.</p>
