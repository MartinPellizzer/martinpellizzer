<p>Chamaesyce celastroides var. hanapepensis, commonly known as the Hanapepe spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in coastal and rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other members of the Chamaesyce genus.</p>
