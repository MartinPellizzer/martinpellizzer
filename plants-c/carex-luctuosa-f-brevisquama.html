                    <h1>Carex luctuosa f. brevisquama</h1>
<p>Carex luctuosa f. brevisquama, commonly known as the short-awned sorrowgrass, is a perennial sedge characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, a common feature among sedges. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly rough texture, with the distinctive short awns on the bracts of the flowering spikes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
