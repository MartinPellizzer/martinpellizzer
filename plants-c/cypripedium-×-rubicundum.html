                    <h1>Cypripedium × rubicundum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × rubicundum, commonly known as the red-lip lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive red-lipped pouch, which serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
