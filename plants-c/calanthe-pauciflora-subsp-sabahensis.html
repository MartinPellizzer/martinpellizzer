<p>Calanthe pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highland regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves and bears clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
