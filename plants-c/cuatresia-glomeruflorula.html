                    <h1>Cuatresia glomeruflorula</h1>
<p>Cuatresia glomeruflorula, commonly known as the clustered-flowered cuatresia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance during the evening. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and abundant nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cuatresia glomeruflorula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
