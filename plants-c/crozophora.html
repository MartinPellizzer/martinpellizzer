<p>Crozophora, commonly known as the waterweed or water thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Crozophora species are often submerged or floating, with specialized structures that help them thrive in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Their presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
