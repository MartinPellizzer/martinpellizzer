                    <h1>Celastrus senegalensis var. glaucifolius</h1>
<p>Celastrus senegalensis var. glaucifolius, commonly known as the African bindweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, and often glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems.</p>
