                    <h1>Cereus swartzii</h1>
<p>Cereus swartzii, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth pattern involves a period of dormancy followed by rapid growth during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptations, including thick stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming cycle, are key to its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
