                    <h1>Columnea vestita</h1>
<p>Columnea vestita, commonly known as the silver mist plant, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading clusters of tubular, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive, almost misty appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Columnea vestita is often cultivated as a decorative trailing plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas.</p>
