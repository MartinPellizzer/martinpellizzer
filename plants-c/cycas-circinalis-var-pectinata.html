                    <h1>Cycas circinalis var. pectinata</h1>
<p>Cycas circinalis var. pectinata, commonly known as the Pectinata Cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing protection against environmental stress. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but challenging specimen for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its native range.</p>
