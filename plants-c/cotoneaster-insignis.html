                    <h1>Cotoneaster insignis</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster insignis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster insignis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
