                    <h1>Cortiella cortioides</h1>
<p>Cortiella cortioides, commonly known as the common bird's nest fungus, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Cortiniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped or bowl-like cap that often resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structure, known as a pileus, is often covered in a layer of fine, gelatinous material.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in association with hardwood trees.</p>
