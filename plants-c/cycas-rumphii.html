                    <h1>Cycas rumphii</h1>
<p>Cycas rumphii, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil, with a history dating back over 200 million years.</p>
