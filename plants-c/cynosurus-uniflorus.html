<p>Cynosurus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, inconspicuous flower per spikelet. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Cynosurus uniflorus is often found in undisturbed habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations.</p>
