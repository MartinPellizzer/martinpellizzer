                            <h1>Corylus Maxima Var. Alba</h1>
<p>White hazelnut, scientifically known as Corylus maxima var. alba, is a striking plant that captivates with its pure white flowers and edible nuts. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. The plant features bushy foliage and produces clusters of fragrant blooms in early spring, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its nuts, which are larger and sweeter than those of common hazelnuts, are prized for their rich flavor and nutritional value. Despite its beauty, the White hazelnut requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish, making it a rewarding addition to any horticultural collection.</p>
