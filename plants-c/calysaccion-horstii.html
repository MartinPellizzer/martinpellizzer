<p>Calysaccion horstii, commonly known as the Horstii cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a specimen plant in gardens and parks.</p>
