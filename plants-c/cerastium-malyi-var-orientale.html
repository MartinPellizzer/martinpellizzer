                    <h1>Cerastium malyi var. orientale</h1>
<p>Cerastium malyi var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
