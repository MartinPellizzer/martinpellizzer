<p>Clidemia aristigera, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silver-white hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Clidemia aristigera plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, though it can also be a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
