<p>Campanula aparinoides, commonly known as the silverweed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature.</p>
