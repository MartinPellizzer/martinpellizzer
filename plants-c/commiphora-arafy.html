<p>Commiphora arafy, commonly known as Arafy myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants like frankincense and myrrh. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. Its leaves are typically leathery and glossy, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, spiny fruits.</p>
