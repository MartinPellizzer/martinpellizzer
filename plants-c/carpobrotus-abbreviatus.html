                    <h1>Carpobrotus abbreviatus</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus abbreviatus, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize sand dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as an ornamental plant.</p>
