<p>Cerastium lanatum subsp.</p>
<p>nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to high-elevation regions of the Sierra Nevada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, alpine environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 7,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
