                    <h1>Cissus glandulosa</h1>
<p>Cissus glandulosa, commonly known as the adhesive cissus, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its stems have a unique ability to adhere to surfaces, allowing it to climb and spread across rocky or vertical habitats.</p>
<p>Cissus glandulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
