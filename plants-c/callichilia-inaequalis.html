<p>Callichilia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal callichilia, is a member of the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, often hairy texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family.</p>
