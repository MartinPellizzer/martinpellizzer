                    <h1>Comiphyton gabonense</h1>
<p>Comiphyton gabonense, commonly known as the Gabon starleaf, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae, which includes various tropical trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its unique, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Comiphyton gabonense is notable for its lack of secondary growth, making it structurally simple compared to most angiosperms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
