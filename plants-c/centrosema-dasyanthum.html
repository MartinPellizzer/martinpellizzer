                    <h1>Centrosema dasyanthum</h1>
<p>Centrosema dasyanthum, commonly known as the hairy centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.</p>
