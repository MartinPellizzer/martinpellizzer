                    <h1>Ctenitis minima</h1>
<p>Ctenitis minima, commonly known as the small heart fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like frond structure with a heart-shaped base, which gives it its common name. The fronds are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
