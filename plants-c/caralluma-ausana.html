                    <h1>Caralluma ausana</h1>
<p>Caralluma ausana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant has fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are modified into short, spine-like structures to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma ausana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick stems.</p>
