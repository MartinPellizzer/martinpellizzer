<p>Cypella gracilis f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cypella, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
