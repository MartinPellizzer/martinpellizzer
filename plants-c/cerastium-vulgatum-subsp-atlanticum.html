<p>Cerastium vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that are covered with dense, soft, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, forming a dense mat that helps stabilize sand dunes and coastal soils.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found in salt marshes and sandy shores.</p>
