                    <h1>Coffea liberica var. ivorensis</h1>
<p>Coffea liberica var. ivorensis, commonly known as the Ivory Coast coffee, is a variant of the Liberica coffee species native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves and produces large, elongated red berries containing two seeds. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is less commonly cultivated than Arabica or Robusta varieties but is valued for its unique flavor profile.</p>
<p>Due to its lower yield and susceptibility to pests, it remains a niche crop in specific regions.</p>
