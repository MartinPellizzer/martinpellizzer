<p>Calligonum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Calligonum denticulatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions.</p>
