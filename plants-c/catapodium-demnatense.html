                    <h1>Catapodium demnatense</h1>
<p>Catapodium demnatense, commonly known as the Saharan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed and barren soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses adapted to harsh environments.</p>
