                    <h1>Carex paniculata f. brevis</h1>
<p>Carex paniculata f. brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a compact, clump-forming sedge that thrives in moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the standard variety, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces upright, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds or streams.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
