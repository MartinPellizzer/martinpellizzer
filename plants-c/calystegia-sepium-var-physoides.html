                    <h1>Calystegia sepium var. physoides</h1>
<p>Calystegia sepium var. physoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae).</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces white to pale purple blooms, which are typically 5-7 cm in diameter. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
