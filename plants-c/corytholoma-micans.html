                    <h1>Corytholoma micans</h1>
<p>Corytholoma micans, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corytholoma micans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
