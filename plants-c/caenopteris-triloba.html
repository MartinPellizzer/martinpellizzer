<p>Caenopteris triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Caenopteris triloba plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
