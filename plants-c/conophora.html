                    <h1>Conophora</h1>
<p>Conophora, commonly known as the "spleenwort," is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>These small, terrestrial mosses are typically found in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on soil or stone. Conophora species are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form and their ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. The plants have simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in dense, overlapping rows.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
