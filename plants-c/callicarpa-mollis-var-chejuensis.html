                    <h1>Callicarpa mollis var. chejuensis</h1>
<p>Callicarpa mollis var. chejuensis, commonly known as the Cheju beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the island of Jeju in South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1–2 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, which are often hidden beneath the foliage.</p>
<p>The berries are edible when ripe but are generally too tart for most palates, though they are valued in traditional medicine.</p>
