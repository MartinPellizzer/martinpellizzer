                    <h1>Cyclopogon rimbachii</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's cyclopogon, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a crown, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture from the air. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
