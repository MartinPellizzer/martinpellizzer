                    <h1>Carduus giganteus</h1>
<p>Carduus giganteus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, making it a striking presence in its native habitat. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces achenes, small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in new areas.</p>
