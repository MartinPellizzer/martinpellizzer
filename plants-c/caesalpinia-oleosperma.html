                    <h1>Caesalpinia oleosperma</h1>
<p>Caesalpinia oleosperma, commonly known as the oil-rich thorn tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of other Caesalpinia species. The plant produces hard, woody pods containing oily seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical classification. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
