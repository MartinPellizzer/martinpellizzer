<p>Chassalia coriacea var. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's rough chassalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are coriaceous, meaning they are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
