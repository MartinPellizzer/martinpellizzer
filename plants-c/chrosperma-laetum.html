<p>Chrosperma laetum, commonly known as the yellow stonewort, is a type of freshwater algae belonging to the order Trentepohliales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoids. The plant forms dense, filamentous colonies that often grow on submerged rocks or in shallow water. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a thallus made up of branching filaments.</p>
<p>Chrosperma laetum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
