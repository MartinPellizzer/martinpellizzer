                    <h1>Comocladia hollickii</h1>
<p>Comocladia hollickii, commonly known as the Hollick's sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its structure resembles that of a sea holly, with a short stem and tightly clustered leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
