<p>Connarus fasciculatus subsp.</p>
<p>fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered connarus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
