<p>Cyclosorus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes help in the absorption of nutrients from the water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus zeylanicus is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species.</p>
