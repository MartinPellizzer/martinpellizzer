                    <h1>Chelonopsis abbreviata</h1>
<p>Chelonopsis abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, often decumbent stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Chelonopsis abbreviata is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth.</p>
