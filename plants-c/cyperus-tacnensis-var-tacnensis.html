                    <h1>Cyperus tacnensis var. tacnensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus tacnensis var. tacnensis, commonly known as the Tacna flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
