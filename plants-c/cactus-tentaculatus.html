                    <h1>Cactus tentaculatus</h1>
<p>Cactus tentaculatus, commonly known as the giant cactus or the whale cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its massive, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a burst of color to its otherwise stark environment.</p>
