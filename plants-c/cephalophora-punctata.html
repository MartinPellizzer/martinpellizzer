<p>Cephalophora punctata, commonly known as the speckled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a distinctive speckled appearance due to the presence of numerous small bladders.</p>
<p>Cephalophora punctata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.</p>
