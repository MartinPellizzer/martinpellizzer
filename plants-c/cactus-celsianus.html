                <h1>Cactus celsianus</h1>
<p>Cactus celsianus, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus celsianus is well adapted to desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
