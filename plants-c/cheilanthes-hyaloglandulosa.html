<p>Cheilanthes hyaloglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with prominent, glandular hairs on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring dry and sunny environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native range.</p>
