                            <h1>Cnicus Hispanicus</h1>
<p>Cnicus hispanicus is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly known as the Spanish sowthistle and belongs to the Asteraceae family. This plant is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow daisy-like flowers. It often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields and along roadsides. Despite its common presence, it is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
