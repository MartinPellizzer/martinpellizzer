                    <h1>Camaridium imbricatum var. carinatum</h1>
<p>Camaridium imbricatum var. carinatum, commonly known as the ridged sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its succulent leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in dunes and rocky coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
