                    <h1>Corallorhiza ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale yellow twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants through specialized roots. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in association with specific tree species. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or orange, arranged in a spike and lacking petals, which is a common feature among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
