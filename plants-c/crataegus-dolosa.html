<p>Crataegus dolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically narrow and oval, with serrated edges, and it has thorny branches.</p>
<p>Crataegus dolosa is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat.</p>
