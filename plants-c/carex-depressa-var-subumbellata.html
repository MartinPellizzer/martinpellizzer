                    <h1>Carex depressa var. subumbellata</h1>
<p>Carex depressa var. subumbellata, commonly known as the subumbellate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often arranged in umbel-like structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The subumbellate variety is distinguished by its unique inflorescence structure, which sets it apart from other Carex species.</p>
