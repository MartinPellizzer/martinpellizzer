<p>Chionochloa acicularis, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, forming a dense mat close to the ground. This plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms.</p>
<p>Chionochloa acicularis is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is a component of the subantarctic flora.</p>
