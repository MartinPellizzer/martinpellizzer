<p>Cystopteris abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian water fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the air, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.</p>
