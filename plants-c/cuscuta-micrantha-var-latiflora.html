                    <h1>Cuscuta micrantha var. latiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta micrantha var. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hooked structures called haustoria, which attach to host plants. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
