<p>Cecidodaphne, commonly known as the flame tree, is a member of the Lythraceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
