                    <h1>Corallorhiza anandae</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza anandae, commonly known as the Anandâ€™s coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shaded, moist woodlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
