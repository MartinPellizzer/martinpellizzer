                    <h1>Copedesma nitens</h1>
<p>Copedesma nitens, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Copedesma nitens plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
