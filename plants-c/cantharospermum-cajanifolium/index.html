                            <h1>Cantharospermum Cajanifolium</h1>
<p>Java bean, scientifically known as Cantharospermum cajanifolium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is commonly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where it thrives in warm climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. While not a true bean, it is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine for its edible pods and leaves. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>
