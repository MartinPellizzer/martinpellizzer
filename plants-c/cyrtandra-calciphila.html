                    <h1>Cyrtandra calciphila</h1>
<p>Cyrtandra calciphila, commonly known as the limestone cyrtandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. This species thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, making it uniquely adapted to limestone environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra calciphila is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists studying endemic flora.</p>
