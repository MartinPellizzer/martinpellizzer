                    <h1>Conostomium rotatum</h1>
<p>Conostomium rotatum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with bright yellow-green leaves arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Conostomium rotatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
