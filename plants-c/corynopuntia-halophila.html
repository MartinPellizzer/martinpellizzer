                    <h1>Corynopuntia halophila</h1>
<p>Corynopuntia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it highly adapted to harsh, coastal environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure.</p>
<p>Corynopuntia halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
