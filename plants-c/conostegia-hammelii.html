<p>Conostegia hammelii, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish water environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conostegia hammelii is also valued for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
