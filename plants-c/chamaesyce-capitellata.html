                    <h1>Chamaesyce capitellata</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce capitellata, commonly known as the small-headed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels near the top of the stems. Its leaves are usually linear to lanceolate, with a grayish-green color and a pubescent surface, providing camouflage and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce capitellata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
