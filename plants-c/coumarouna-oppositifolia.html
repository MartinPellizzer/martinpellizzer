                    <h1>Coumarouna oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Coumarouna oppositifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, pinnately compound leaves with opposite leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, aromatic quality, making it important in local economies and traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its decline in some regions, raising conservation concerns.</p>
