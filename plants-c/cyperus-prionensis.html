                    <h1>Cyperus prionensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus prionensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus prionensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
