                    <h1>Commiphora mukul</h1>
<p>Commiphora mukul, commonly known as guggul, is a small deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as guggul resin, which has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. This resin is secreted from the bark and is harvested during the dry season.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
