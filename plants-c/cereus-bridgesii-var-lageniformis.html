<p>Cereus bridgesii var. lageniformis, commonly known as the bottle cactus, is a striking succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that resemble bottles, which store water to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and collections.</p>
