                    <h1>Colutea davurica</h1>
<p>Colutea davurica, commonly known as the Siberian broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its host for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
