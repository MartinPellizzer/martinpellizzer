                    <h1>Cuscuta fusiformis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta fusiformis, commonly known as the spindle-shaped dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive spindle-shaped body that allows it to缠绕 and attach to its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind or animals, facilitating its spread to new hosts. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens where it can infest a variety of crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
