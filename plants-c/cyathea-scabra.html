                    <h1>Cyathea scabra</h1>
<p>Cyathea scabra, commonly known as the rough hound's-tongue, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. Cyathea scabra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
