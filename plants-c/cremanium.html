<p>Cremanium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often with thick, fleshy rhizomes.</p>
<p>Some species of Cremanium are cultivated for their ornamental value, though many contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
