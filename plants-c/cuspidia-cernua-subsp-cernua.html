<p>Cuspidia cernua subsp.</p>
<p>cernua, commonly known as the weeping cuspidia, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that hang downward, giving it a cascading appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
