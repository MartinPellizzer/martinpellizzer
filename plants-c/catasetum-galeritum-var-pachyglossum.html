                    <h1>Catasetum galeritum var. pachyglossum</h1>
<p>Catasetum galeritum var. pachyglossum, commonly known as the showy catasetum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, long, and often brightly colored lip, which is a defining feature of the Catasetum genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and attract specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>The varietal name *pachyglossum* refers to its thick, fleshy lip, which is both a botanical and ornamental trait.</p>
