<p>Cyperus trachycladus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a species of sedge native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus trachycladus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
