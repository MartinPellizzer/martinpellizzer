<p>Cladium crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Cladium crassum plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
