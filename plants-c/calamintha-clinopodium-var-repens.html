<p>Calamintha clinopodium var. repens, commonly known as creeping calamint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their calming properties.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover in moist, shady environments.</p>
