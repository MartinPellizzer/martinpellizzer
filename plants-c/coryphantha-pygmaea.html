                    <h1>Coryphantha pygmaea</h1>
<p>Coryphantha pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and is often grown in containers to protect it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
