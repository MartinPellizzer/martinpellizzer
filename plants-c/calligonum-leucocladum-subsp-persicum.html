<p>Calligonum leucocladum subsp.</p>
<p>persicum, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
