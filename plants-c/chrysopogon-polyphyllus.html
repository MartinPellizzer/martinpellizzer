                    <h1>Chrysopogon polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, pale green to golden yellow inflorescences, which are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
