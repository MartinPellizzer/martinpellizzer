<p>Cathartolinum, commonly known as the cathartic plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of cathartic compounds, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
