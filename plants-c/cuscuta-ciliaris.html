<p>Cuscuta ciliaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can infest a variety of crops.</p>
<p>Cuscuta ciliaris is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
