                    <h1>Cephalotaxus drupacea var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Cephalotaxus drupacea var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with dense foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its attractive form and seasonal color changes, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
