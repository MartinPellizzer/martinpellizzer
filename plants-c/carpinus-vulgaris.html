                    <h1>Carpinus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Carpinus vulgaris, commonly known as hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and its small, inconspicuous green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, oval-shaped fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base.</p>
<p>Hornbeam is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
