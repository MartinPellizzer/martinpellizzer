                    <h1>Cyclobothra monophylla</h1>
<p>Cyclobothra monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, large, fan-shaped leaf that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered.</p>
