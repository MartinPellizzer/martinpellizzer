                    <h1>Corymbia arenaria</h1>
<p>Corymbia arenaria, commonly known as the coastal tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin sheets, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>Corymbia arenaria is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
