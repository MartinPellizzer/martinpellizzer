                    <h1>Cancrinia pamirica</h1>
<p>Cancrinia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid and cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Cancrinia pamirica is an important species for studying alpine plant ecology.</p>
