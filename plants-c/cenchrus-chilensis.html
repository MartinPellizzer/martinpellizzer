                    <h1>Cenchrus chilensis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus chilensis, commonly known as Chilean sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry regions.</p>
