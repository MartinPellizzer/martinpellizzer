                    <h1>Cotoneaster acutifolius f. glabriusculus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster acutifolius f. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are smooth and slightly leathery, distinguishing it from other cotoneaster species. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a hedge.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its year-round interest.</p>
