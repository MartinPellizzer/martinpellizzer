                    <h1>Coffea lemblinii</h1>
<p>Coffea lemblinii, commonly known as the Lemblin's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, specifically the Bale Mountains. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red berries containing the coffee beans. The beans of Coffea lemblinii are typically smaller and have a distinct flavor profile compared to more commonly cultivated coffee species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee variety.</p>
