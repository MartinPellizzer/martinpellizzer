                <h1>Ceropegia carnosa</h1>
<p>Ceropegia carnosa, commonly known as the elephant's foot or the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, tuberous roots that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has trailing stems with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or greenish-white, are unique in structure and attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Ceropegia carnosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
