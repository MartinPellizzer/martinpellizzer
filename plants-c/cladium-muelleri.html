                    <h1>Cladium muelleri</h1>
<p>Cladium muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that contribute to the structure of marsh ecosystems. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowering spikes are usually short and clustered, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Cladium muelleri plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
