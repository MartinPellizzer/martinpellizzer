                    <h1>Chamaeriphes coriacea</h1>
<p>Chamaeriphes coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Chamaeriphes coriacea is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
