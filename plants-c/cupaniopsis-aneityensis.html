<p>Cupaniopsis aneityensis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The rock fig is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
