<p>Cordia rothschuhii, commonly known as the desert cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in providing food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Cordia rothschuhii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
