                    <h1>Cyclandra ledermannii</h1>
<p>Cyclandra ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Cyclandra ledermannii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
