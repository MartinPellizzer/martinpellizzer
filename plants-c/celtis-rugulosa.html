<p>Celtis rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Celtis rugulosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplain forests.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its fruit and foliage.</p>
