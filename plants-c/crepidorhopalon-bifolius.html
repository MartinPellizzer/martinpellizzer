                    <h1>Crepidorhopalon bifolius</h1>
<p>Crepidorhopalon bifolius, commonly known as the two-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often found in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
