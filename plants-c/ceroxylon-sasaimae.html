                    <h1>Ceroxylon sasaimae</h1>
<p>Ceroxylon sasaimae, commonly known as the Sasaima wax palm, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant is notable for its unique wax-like coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
