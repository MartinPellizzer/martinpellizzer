                    <h1>Chrysocyathus</h1>
<p>Chrysocyathus, commonly known as the golden cup, is a rare and delicate marine organism belonging to the order Sphenoporida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, cup-shaped structure composed of calcium carbonate, which provides it with structural support in its aquatic environment. The organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it thrives in warm, clear waters with moderate currents. Its vibrant yellow coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments within its calcified skeleton.</p>
<p>Chrysocyathus plays a minor but ecologically significant role in marine ecosystems by contributing to reef structures and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
