<p>Cuscuta pentandra, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its yellow, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions across the globe, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It typically infests crops such as corn, beans, and wheat, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta pentandra plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and serving as a food source for certain insects and animals.</p>
