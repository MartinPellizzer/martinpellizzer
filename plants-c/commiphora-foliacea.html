                    <h1>Commiphora foliacea</h1>
<p>Commiphora foliacea, commonly known as the leafy myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its aromatic resin, similar to myrrh, has been used traditionally in incense and medicine.</p>
<p>Commiphora foliacea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
