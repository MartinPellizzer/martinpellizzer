                    <h1>Cerastium arvense var. boissieri</h1>
<p>Cerastium arvense var. boissieri, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
