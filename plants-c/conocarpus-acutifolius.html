<p>Conocarpus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its bark is rough and fissured, while its roots system helps stabilize shorelines and filter sediments.</p>
<p>Conocarpus acutifolius plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
