                    <h1>Crocodilodes viscosa</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes viscosa, commonly known as the sticky crocodile plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its sticky secretions, which give it its common name, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Crocodilodes viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
