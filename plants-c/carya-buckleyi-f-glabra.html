<p>Carya buckleyi f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hickory, is a variant of the hickory genus native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other hickory species. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, similar to other members of the Carya genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The smooth hickory is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
