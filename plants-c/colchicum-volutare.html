                    <h1>Colchicum volutare</h1>
<p>Colchicum volutare, commonly known as the purple autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its bulbous underground corm, which stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
