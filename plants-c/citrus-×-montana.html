<p>Citrus × montana, commonly known as the trifoliate orange.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid citrus plant originating from a cross between Poncirus trifoliata and Citrus sinensis. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically not eaten due to their bitter taste but are used in horticulture for their cold hardiness.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a rootstock in citrus cultivation.</p>
