                    <h1>Cycas jenkinsiana</h1>
<p>Cycas jenkinsiana, commonly known as the Jenkins cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
