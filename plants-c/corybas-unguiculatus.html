<p>Corybas unguiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a deep violet to purple coloration, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on flies rather than bees.</p>
