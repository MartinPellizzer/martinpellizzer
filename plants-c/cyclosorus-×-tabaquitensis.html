                    <h1>Cyclosorus × tabaquitensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × tabaquitensis, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare and intriguing species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus tabaqui.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, including a distinctive reddish hue in its fronds and a complex rhizoidal system. It is primarily found in the Andean region of South America, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, shaded aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
