                    <h1>Cuscuta gracillima</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gracillima, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years, waiting for a suitable host to germinate.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to agricultural crops.</p>
