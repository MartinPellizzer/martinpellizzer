<p>Calamagrostis muiriana, commonly known as the Muir's reed, is a tall perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver-gray sheen. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, which are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis muiriana is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
