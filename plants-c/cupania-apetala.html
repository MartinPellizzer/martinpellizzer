<p>Cupania apetala, commonly known as the flowerless cupania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its lack of visible flowers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Cupania apetala is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
