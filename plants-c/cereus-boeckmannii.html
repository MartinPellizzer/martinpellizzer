<p>Cereus boeckmannii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a striking cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a vibrant, rounded body with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. Its unique appearance, often combined with a different cactus species for grafting, makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it requires careful watering and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
