                    <h1>Cheilanthes flexuosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes flexuosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense, resilient colonies.</p>
