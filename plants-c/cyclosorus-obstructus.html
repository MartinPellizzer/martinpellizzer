                    <h1>Cyclosorus obstructus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus obstructus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a rare aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
