<p>Cardamine muscosa, commonly known as the mossy water-crowfoot, is a small perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Cardamine muscosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
