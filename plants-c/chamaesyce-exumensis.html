                    <h1>Chamaesyce exumensis</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce exumensis, commonly known as the Exum's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chamaesyce exumensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
