                    <h1>Chlora perfoliata var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Chlora perfoliata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved chlora, is a variant of the chlora plant characterized by its sessile leaves that are directly attached to the stem.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
