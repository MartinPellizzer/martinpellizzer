                    <h1>Cenchrus stramineus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus stramineus, commonly known as the slender grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Cenchrus stramineus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control.</p>
