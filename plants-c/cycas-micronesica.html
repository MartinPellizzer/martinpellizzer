                    <h1>Cycas micronesica</h1>
<p>Cycas micronesica, commonly known as the Micronesian cycad, is a primitive plant species belonging to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical islands of Micronesia, particularly Guam, Rota, and Tinian. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem covered in a thick, fibrous trunk, and it produces large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. Cycas micronesica is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and it reproduces through cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species.</p>
