                    <h1>Cheilanthes squamosa var. brachypus</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes squamosa var. brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more narrow leaves compared to the typical form of *Cheilanthes squamosa*.</p>
