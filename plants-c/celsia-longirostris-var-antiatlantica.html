                    <h1>Celsia longirostris var. antiatlantica</h1>
<p>Celsia longirostris var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species for studying coastal botany and adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
