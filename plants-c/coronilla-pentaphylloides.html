                    <h1>Coronilla pentaphylloides</h1>
<p>Coronilla pentaphylloides, commonly known as the five-leafed crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate and pentaphylloid leaves, which consist of three to five leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
