                    <h1>Carex dioica var. androgyna</h1>
<p>Carex dioica var. androgyna, commonly known as the male-female carex, is a variant of the greenish sedge that exhibits unique sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its separate male and female inflorescences, which are typically found on distinct stems. The male flowers produce pollen, while the female flowers develop into seed-bearing structures. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various insect and bird species.</p>
