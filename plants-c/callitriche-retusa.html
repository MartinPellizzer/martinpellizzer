                    <h1>Callitriche retusa</h1>
<p>Callitriche retusa, commonly known as the broadleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its floating or submerged growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche retusa plays a role in water ecosystem stability by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
