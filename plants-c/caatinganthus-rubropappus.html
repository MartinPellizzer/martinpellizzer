                <h1>Caatinganthus rubropappus</h1>
<p>Caatinganthus rubropappus, commonly known as the red-haired caatinga bush, is a flowering plant native to the caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to the dry, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces striking red bracts that enclose small, yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is resilient to drought, making it a hardy species in its native environment.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of the caatinga ecosystem.</p>
