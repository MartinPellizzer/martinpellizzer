<p>Cyperus globosus var. cymosus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, triangular leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that aid in vegetative propagation.</p>
