                    <h1>Cerastium pumilum var. crassifolium</h1>
<p>Cerastium pumilum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are broader and thicker than those of the typical Cerastium pumilum, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in gardens and natural habitats.</p>
