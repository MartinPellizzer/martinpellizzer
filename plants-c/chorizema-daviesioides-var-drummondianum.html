<p>Chorizema daviesioides var. drummondianum, commonly known as Drummond's cholla, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water for survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
