                    <h1>Coeloglossum acuminatum</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum acuminatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It requires specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
