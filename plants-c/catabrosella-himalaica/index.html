                            <h1>Catabrosella Himalaica</h1>
<p>Catabrosella himalaica is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its striking violet-colored blooms. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
