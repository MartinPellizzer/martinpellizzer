                    <h1>Cuscuta somaxacola</h1>
<p>Cuscuta somaxacola, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that then attach to host plants, leading to the eventual death of the host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
