                    <h1>Caralluma wissmannii</h1>
<p>Caralluma wissmannii, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma wissmannii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
