                    <h1>Clavigera brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Clavigera brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions.</p>
