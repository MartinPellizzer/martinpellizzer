                    <h1>Ctenitis protensa var. dicksonioides</h1>
<p>Ctenitis protensa var. dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's sea holly, is a rare and striking plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a waxy, blue-gray sheen that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, spiky flowers in shades of purple and blue, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
