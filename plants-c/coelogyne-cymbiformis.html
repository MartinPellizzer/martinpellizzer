<p>Coelogyne cymbiformis, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Coelogyne cymbiformis prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
