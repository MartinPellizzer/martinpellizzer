<p>Cyperus lanceolatus var. tener, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant thrives in moist soils, making it a common species in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
