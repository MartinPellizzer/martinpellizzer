<p>Cyperus monroviensis, commonly known as the African bulbous sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies.</p>
<p>Cyperus monroviensis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
