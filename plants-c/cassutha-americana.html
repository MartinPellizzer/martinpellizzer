                    <h1>Cassutha americana</h1>
<p>Cassutha americana, commonly known as American morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental and a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>Cassutha americana is valued for its aesthetic appeal but requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
