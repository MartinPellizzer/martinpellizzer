<p>Cornopteris birii, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cornopteris birii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
