                    <h1>Cryptogramma</h1>
<p>Cryptogramma, commonly known as the rockcap moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Cryptogramma species have a unique structure with a dense, overlapping arrangement of leaves that form a protective layer over the gametophyte. They lack true roots and instead absorb water and nutrients through their leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Due to their small size and specialized habitats, they are often overlooked but play an important role in ecosystem stability.</p>
