                    <h1>Cyathea everta</h1>
<p>Cyathea everta, commonly known as the Evert's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyathea everta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction through spore dispersal.</p>
