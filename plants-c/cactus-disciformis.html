                    <h1>Cactus disciformis</h1>
<p>Cactus disciformis, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate flowers, the cactus is highly drought-tolerant and well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
