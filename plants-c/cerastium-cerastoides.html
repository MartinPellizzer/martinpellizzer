<p>Cerastium cerastoides, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its creeping habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
