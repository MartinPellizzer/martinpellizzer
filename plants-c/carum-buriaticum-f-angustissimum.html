                    <h1>Carum buriaticum f. angustissimum</h1>
<p>Carum buriaticum f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caraway, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and dill. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is noted for its distinct, spicy scent. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit distinguish it from other caraway species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant in its native habitat.</p>
