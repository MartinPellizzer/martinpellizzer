                    <h1>Cleistopholis platypetala</h1>
<p>Cleistopholis platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic organism that forms a mutualistic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide it with nutrients through photosynthesis. This lichen typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can withstand extreme conditions. Its morphology is characterized by a crust-like thallus that is often pale green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Cleistopholis platypetala plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
