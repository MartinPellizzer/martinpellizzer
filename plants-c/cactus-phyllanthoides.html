                    <h1>Cactus phyllanthoides</h1>
<p>Cactus phyllanthoides, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a dense covering of spines that provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to desert conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
