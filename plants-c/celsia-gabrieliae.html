<p>Celsia gabrieliae, commonly known as the Gabriel's celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Celsia gabrieliae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
