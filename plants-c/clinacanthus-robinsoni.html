                    <h1>Clinacanthus robinsoni</h1>
<p>Clinacanthus robinsoni, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
