                    <h1>Cucubalus alpinus</h1>
<p>Cucubalus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, heart-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are small, elongated, and resemble cucumbers, though they are typically bitter and not widely cultivated for consumption.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cool, high-altitude environments, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
