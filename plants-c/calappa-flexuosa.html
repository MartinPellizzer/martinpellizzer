<p>Calappa flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisting stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps it climb and secure itself to supports. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the species. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
