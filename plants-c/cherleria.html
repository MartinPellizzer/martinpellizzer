                    <h1>Cherleria</h1>
<p>Cherleria, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions across Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
<p>Cherleria is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
