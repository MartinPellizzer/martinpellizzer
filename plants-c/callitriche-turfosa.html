<p>Callitriche turfosa, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, floating leaves that are oval to heart-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Callitriche turfosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
