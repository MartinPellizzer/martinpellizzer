<p>Carduus altaicus, commonly known as the Siberian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, pale yellow flower heads. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
