                    <h1>Choristigma</h1>
<p>Choristigma, commonly known as the "false orchid," is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, but unlike typical orchids, it lacks the characteristic pseudobulbs and has a more herbaceous structure. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth pattern, with each node producing a new shoot. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a spiral, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Choristigma is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments.</p>
