<p>Cypripedium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, elongated leaf, making it easily distinguishable from other orchid species. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
