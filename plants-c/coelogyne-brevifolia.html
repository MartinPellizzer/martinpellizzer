                    <h1>Coelogyne brevifolia</h1>
<p>Coelogyne brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Coelogyne brevifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment.</p>
