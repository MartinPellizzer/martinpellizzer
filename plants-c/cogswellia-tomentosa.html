<p>Cogswellia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers its stems, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in a rounded or clump-like form, with short, thick stems that store water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Cogswellia tomentosa is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
