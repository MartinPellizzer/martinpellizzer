                    <h1>Cheilanthes coriacea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes coriacea, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered near the margins. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
