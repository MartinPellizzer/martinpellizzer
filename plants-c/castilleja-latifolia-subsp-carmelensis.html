<p>Castilleja latifolia subsp.</p>
<p>carmelensis, commonly known as Carmel owl's clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal grasslands and dunes.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological characteristics compared to other Castilleja species.</p>
