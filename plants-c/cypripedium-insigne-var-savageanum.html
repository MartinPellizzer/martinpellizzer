<p>Cypripedium insigne var. savageanum, commonly known as the Savage's Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, upright stem that bears a single or occasionally two flowers. It thrives in cool, shaded habitats with high humidity, often growing in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
