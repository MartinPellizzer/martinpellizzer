                    <h1>Castilleja chiriquiensis</h1>
<p>Castilleja chiriquiensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu√≠ milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, often hairy stems. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them while also hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
