                            <h1>Cacalia Seemanniana</h1>
<p>Common cacalia, scientifically known as Cacalia seemanniana, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like blooms. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, Common cacalia plays an important role in local ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental beauty.</p>
