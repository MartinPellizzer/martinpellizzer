<p>Calylophus hartwegii subsp.</p>
<p>toumeyi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession.</p>
