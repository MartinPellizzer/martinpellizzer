<p>Chenopodina leiosperma, commonly known as the smoothleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Chenopodina leiosperma is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
