                    <h1>Calyptranthes compressa</h1>
<p>Calyptranthes compressa, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>Calyptranthes compressa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in areas with mild, coastal climates.</p>
