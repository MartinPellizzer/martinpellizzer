<p>Ctenodon niveus, commonly known as the white ctenodon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
