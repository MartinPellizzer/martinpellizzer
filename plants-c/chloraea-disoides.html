                    <h1>Chloraea disoides</h1>
<p>Chloraea disoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coralroot, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a non-photosynthetic species. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, which it absorbs through its root system. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, with a distinctive coral-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
