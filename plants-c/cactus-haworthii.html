                    <h1>Cactus haworthii</h1>
<p>Cactus haworthii, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance featuring cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus haworthii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
