                    <h1>Coincya monensis var. johnstonii</h1>
<p>Coincya monensis var. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinct central vein and wavy margins. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, often in shallow, nutrient-rich habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
