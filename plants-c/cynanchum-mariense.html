                    <h1>Cynanchum mariense</h1>
<p>Cynanchum mariense, commonly known as sea horker, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Cynanchum mariense is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and ability to tolerate salt spray make it an important component of maritime flora.</p>
