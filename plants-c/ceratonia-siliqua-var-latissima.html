                    <h1>Ceratonia siliqua var. latissima</h1>
<p>Ceratonia siliqua var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved carob tree, is a variant of the carob tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are wider than those of the typical carob tree. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain sweet, edible seeds surrounded by a sticky pulp. It thrives in dry, warm climates and is often used for its nutritional value and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural ecosystems.</p>
