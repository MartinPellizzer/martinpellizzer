<p>Chamaenerion angustifolium var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
