                    <h1>Cyclosorus hispidifolius</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus hispidifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaf cyclosorus, is a rare fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on the leaf surface.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus hispidifolius is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
