<p>Chamaesyce florida, commonly known as the Florida sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve moisture in sandy or dry soils. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce florida is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and open fields, and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland dune environments.</p>
