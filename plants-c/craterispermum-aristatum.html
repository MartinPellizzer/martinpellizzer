<p>Craterispermum aristatum, commonly known as the arrowhead cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in xerophytic plants adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Craterispermum aristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
