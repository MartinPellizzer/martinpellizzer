                    <h1>Calamagrostis buschiana</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis buschiana, commonly known as the Buschiana reed or silver reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer, which are often overlooked but contribute to its ecological value. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis buschiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
