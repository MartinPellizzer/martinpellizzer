                    <h1>Calanthe seikooensis</h1>
<p>Calanthe seikooensis, commonly known as the Seikoo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink or white with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calanthe seikooensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
