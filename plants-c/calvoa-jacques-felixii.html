The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain.</p>
