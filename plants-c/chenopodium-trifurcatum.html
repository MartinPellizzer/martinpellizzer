                    <h1>Chenopodium trifurcatum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium trifurcatum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>After flowering, the plant becomes dry and brittle, and its wind-dispersed seeds allow it to spread widely across disturbed soils.</p>
