<p>Chorizopteris pinnata, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Chorizopteris pinnata make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
