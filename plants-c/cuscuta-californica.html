                    <h1>Cuscuta californica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks leaves, chlorophyll, and a root system.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in dry, disturbed areas. It is native to the western United States and is considered an annual species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it a unique example of parasitic plant behavior.</p>
