                    <h1>Cuscuta cozumeliensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cozumeliensis, commonly known as the Cozumel dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to Central America and is often found growing on plants such as morning glory and other flowering vines. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological impact.</p>
