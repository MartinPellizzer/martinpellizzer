<p>Cerastium strictum subsp.</p>
<p>tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
