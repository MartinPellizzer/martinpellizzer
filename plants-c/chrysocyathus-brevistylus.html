                    <h1>Chrysocyathus brevistylus</h1>
<p>Chrysocyathus brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled chrysocyathus, is a rare and delicate marine sponge found in shallow tropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chrysocyathidae and is characterized by its small, branching structure with a distinctive, short stylus. The sponge's body is composed of a porous skeleton made of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support. It typically grows on coral substrates and is often found in reef environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
