<p>Cattleya × mantinix, commonly known as the mantinix orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya labiata.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features large, showy flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of pink, orange, and red, and a distinctive lip that is typically darker and more contrasting.
