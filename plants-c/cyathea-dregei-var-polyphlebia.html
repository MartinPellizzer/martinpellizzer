                    <h1>Cyathea dregei var. polyphlebia</h1>
<p>Cyathea dregei var. polyphlebia, commonly known as the African tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
