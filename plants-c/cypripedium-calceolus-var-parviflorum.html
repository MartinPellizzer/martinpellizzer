                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and protected orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically ranging in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that serves as a pollinator trap. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable in many regions.</p>
