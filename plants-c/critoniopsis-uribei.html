                    <h1>Critoniopsis uribei</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis uribei, commonly known as the Urib√©'s ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the Andean highlands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, translucent leaves that resemble those of a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. The plant's flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique, spathaceous structure that encloses the reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Critoniopsis uribei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
