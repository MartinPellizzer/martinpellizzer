                    <h1>Coelorachis geminata</h1>
<p>Coelorachis geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Coelorachis geminata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
