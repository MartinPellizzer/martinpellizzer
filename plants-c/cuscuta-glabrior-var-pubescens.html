                    <h1>Cuscuta glabrior var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta glabrior var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It features slender, yellow or orange stems that twine around its host, often forming a dense, tangled mass. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) stems, which set it apart from other dodder species.</p>
