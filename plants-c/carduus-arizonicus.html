                    <h1>Carduus arizonicus</h1>
<p>Carduus arizonicus, commonly known as Arizona thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woolly leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in harsh conditions, and it can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
