                    <h1>Cypripedium biflora</h1>
<p>Cypripedium biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its two separate flowers, one upper and one lower, are a unique feature that sets it apart from other lady's slipper species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium biflora is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
