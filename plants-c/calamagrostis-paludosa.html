<p>Calamagrostis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh reed grass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
