<p>Ceanothus dentatus subsp.</p>
<p>floribundus, commonly known as the showy ceanothus, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada. It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
