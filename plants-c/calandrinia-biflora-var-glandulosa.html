                    <h1>Calandrinia biflora var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Calandrinia biflora var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle make it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
