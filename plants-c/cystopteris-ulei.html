                    <h1>Cystopteris ulei</h1>
<p>Cystopteris ulei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cystopteris ulei is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
