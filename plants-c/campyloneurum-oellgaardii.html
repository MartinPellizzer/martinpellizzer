                    <h1>Campyloneurum oellgaardii</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact tufts, typical of clubmosses. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, facilitating its reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
