                    <h1>Cyperus dubius var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus dubius var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
