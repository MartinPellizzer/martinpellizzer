                            <h1>Catalpa Macrocarpa</h1>
<p>The catalpa macrocarpa, also known as the large-flowered catalpa, is a striking deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is recognized for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This tree can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, making it a prominent feature in forests and landscapes. Its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive seed pods add to its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, the catalpa macrocarpa is also known for its susceptibility to certain pests and diseases.</p>
