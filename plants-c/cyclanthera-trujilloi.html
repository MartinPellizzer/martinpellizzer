<p>Cyclanthera trujilloi, commonly known as the Trujillo cucumber, is a rare and unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of Peru and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, a common trait in the gourd family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclanthera trujilloi is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
