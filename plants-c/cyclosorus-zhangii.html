<p>Cyclosorus zhangii, commonly known as the Zhang's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant is native to China and is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus zhangii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
