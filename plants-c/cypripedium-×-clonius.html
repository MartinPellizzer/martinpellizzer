                    <h1>Cypripedium × clonius</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × clonius, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a contrasting yellow or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
