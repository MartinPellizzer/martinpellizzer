<p>Chrysopteris dictyocallis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are usually scale-like and lack true stomata, which is a distinctive botanical feature.</p>
<p>It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
