                    <h1>Chamaescilla</h1>
<p>Chamaescilla, commonly known as the rock heath or sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent leaves. Chamaescilla species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. They often have a low, spreading growth habit, making them suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, are often tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
