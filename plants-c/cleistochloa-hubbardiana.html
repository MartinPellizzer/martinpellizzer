<p>Cleistochloa hubbardiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, inconspicuous flowers, which are often enclosed by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
