                    <h1>Coffea nudiflora</h1>
<p>Coffea nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that lack petals, hence its common name, and these flowers are often clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing one or two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is less commercially significant compared to other coffee species.</p>
