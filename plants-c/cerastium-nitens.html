<p>Cerastium nitens, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Cerastium nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, frost-resistant blooms.</p>
