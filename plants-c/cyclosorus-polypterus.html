<p>Cyclosorus polypterus, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spiral arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Cyclosorus polypterus lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>It plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
