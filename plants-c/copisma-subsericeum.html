<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Copisma subsericeum is an important component of wetland biodiversity and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
