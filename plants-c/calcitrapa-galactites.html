<p>Calcitrapa galactites, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the milky sap it exudes, which contains latex and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Calcitrapa galactites is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
