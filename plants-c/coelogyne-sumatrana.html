                    <h1>Coelogyne sumatrana</h1>
<p>Coelogyne sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periodic dry seasons. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing moisture from the environment.</p>
<p>Coelogyne sumatrana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine.</p>
