                    <h1>Cohniella helicantha</h1>
<p>Cohniella helicantha, commonly known as the spiral-leaved tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cohniella helicantha is adapted to thrive in saline soils and is often found in washes and along riverbanks.</p>
