<p>Chamaesyce leonardii, commonly known as Leonard's sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to arid environments. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, fleshy leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
