<p>Cyperus houghtonii var. bushii, commonly known as the Houghton's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often subtended by bracts. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Cyperus genus, sharing similar botanical features but with distinct morphological differences.</p>
