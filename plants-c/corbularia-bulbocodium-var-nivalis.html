                    <h1>Corbularia bulbocodium var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Corbularia bulbocodium var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation emerges. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
