                    <h1>Cycloloma</h1>
<p>Cycloloma, commonly known as the needlepod or needlepod vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Cycloloma species are often found in rocky soils and can be used for erosion control due to their hardy nature.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods, which contribute to its common name.</p>
