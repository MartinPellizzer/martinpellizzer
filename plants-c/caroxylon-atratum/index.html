                            <h1>Caroxylon Atratum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon atratum is a rare and ancient plant species that thrived during the Paleozoic era. It is known for its unique morphology and fossilized remains that provide insight into early plant evolution. This plant is often found in coal deposits, indicating its role in ancient ecosystems. Its study helps scientists understand the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. Despite its historical significance, Caroxylon atratum remains largely unknown to the general public.</p>
