<p>Chondrosum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in umbels, and their leaves are typically fern-like in appearance. Chondrosum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are often found growing in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh conditions due to their adaptations.</p>
<p>The genus is noted for its ornamental value, though it is not widely cultivated due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements.</p>
