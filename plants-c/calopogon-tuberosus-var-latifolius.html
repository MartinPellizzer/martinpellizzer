                    <h1>Calopogon tuberosus var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Calopogon tuberosus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf bog onion, is a rare and delicate wetland plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils of pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas and is protected in several states.</p>
