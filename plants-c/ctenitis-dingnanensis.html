<p>Ctenitis dingnanensis, commonly known as the Dingnan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
