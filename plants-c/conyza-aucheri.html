                    <h1>Conyza aucheri</h1>
<p>Conyza aucheri, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its invasive potential in new environments.</p>
<p>Conyza aucheri is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
