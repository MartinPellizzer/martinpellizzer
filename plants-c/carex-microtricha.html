<p>Carex microtricha, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green to brown in color. Native to wet or moist environments, this plant thrives in marshy areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex microtricha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
