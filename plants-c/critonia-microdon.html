                    <h1>Critonia microdon</h1>
<p>Critonia microdon, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of coniferous trees such as pines and firs. Its small, scale-like leaves are often hidden among the host's foliage, and it produces tiny, white berries that are a food source for birds. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
