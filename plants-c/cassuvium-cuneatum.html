                    <h1>Cassuvium cuneatum</h1>
<p>Cassuvium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Cassuvium cuneatum is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks.</p>
