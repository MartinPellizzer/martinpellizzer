                    <h1>Cissampelopsis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Cissampelopsis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Cissampelopsis glandulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
