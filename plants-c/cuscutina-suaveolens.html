                    <h1>Cuscutina suaveolens</h1>
<p>Cuscutina suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's stems are slender and yellowish, with a sticky surface that allows it to adhere to its host. It is often found growing on plants like cotton, beans, and other agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings.</p>
