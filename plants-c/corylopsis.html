                    <h1>Corylopsis</h1>
<p>Corylopsis, commonly known as flame twisted or winterberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their vibrant, often orange or yellow flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Corylopsis species are valued for their ornamental value, especially in gardens where they provide color during the otherwise dull winter months.</p>
<p>They prefer well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making them adaptable to a variety of garden environments.</p>
