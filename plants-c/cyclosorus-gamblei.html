                    <h1>Cyclosorus gamblei</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus gamblei, commonly known as the Gambler's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a shuttlecock. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and thrives in shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus gamblei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
