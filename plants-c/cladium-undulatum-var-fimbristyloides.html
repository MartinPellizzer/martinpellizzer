                    <h1>Cladium undulatum var. fimbristyloides</h1>
<p>Cladium undulatum var. fimbristyloides, commonly known as the Florida marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely hairy leaf sheaths and slender flowering stems.</p>
