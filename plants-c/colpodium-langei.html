                    <h1>Colpodium langei</h1>
<p>Colpodium langei, commonly known as the Lange's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. It has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Colpodium langei is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
