<p>Bhut jolokia, scientifically known as Capsicum indicum var. grossum, is a fiery chili pepper native to the northeastern region of India. This plant is renowned for producing one of the hottest peppers in the world, with a Scoville heat unit rating that often exceeds 1 million. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its vibrant red fruits are not only a staple in local cuisines but also highly valued for their intense flavor and medicinal properties. Cultivated for centuries, Bhut jolokia continues to be a symbol of both culinary excellence and agricultural tradition.</p>
