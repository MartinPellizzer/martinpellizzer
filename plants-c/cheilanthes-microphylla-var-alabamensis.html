                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. alabamensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone outcrops and open woodlands. Its fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in size and shape.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its thick, water-storing leaf tissue.</p>
