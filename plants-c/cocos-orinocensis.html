<p>Cocos orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco coconut, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single kernel, similar to other coconut species. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
