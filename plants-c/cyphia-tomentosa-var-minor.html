                    <h1>Cyphia tomentosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Cyphia tomentosa var. minor, commonly known as the woolly cyphia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a low, cushion-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
