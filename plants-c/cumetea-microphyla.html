<p>Cumetea microphyla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and other broadleaf species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like and closely clustered, forming dense clusters on the host's branches.</p>
<p>Cumetea microphyla plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth and survival of its host trees.</p>
