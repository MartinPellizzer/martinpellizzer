<p>Cynorkis humblotiana, commonly known as the Humblot's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
