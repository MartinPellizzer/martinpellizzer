                    <h1>Cervaria caucasica</h1>
<p>Cervaria caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Caucasus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host plants. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
