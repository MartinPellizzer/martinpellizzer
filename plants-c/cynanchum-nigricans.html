                    <h1>Cynanchum nigricans</h1>
<p>Cynanchum nigricans, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its dark green, often hairy leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
