                    <h1>Calopteryx</h1>
<p>Calopteryx, commonly known as the jewelwing damselfly, is a genus of small, aquatic insects belonging to the family Coenagrionidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their iridescent wing covers, which display vibrant colors such as blue, green, and copper, often reflecting light in a dazzling manner. They are typically found near freshwater habitats like ponds, streams, and marshes, where they lay their eggs in aquatic vegetation. The larvae, known as naiads, live in water and undergo metamorphosis to emerge as adults.</p>
<p>Calopteryx species play an important role in aquatic ecosystems as both predators and prey.</p>
