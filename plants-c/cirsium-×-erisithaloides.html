<p>Cirsium × erisithaloides, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a rounded cluster.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
