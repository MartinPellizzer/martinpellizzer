                    <h1>Cibotium glaucum</h1>
<p>Cibotium glaucum, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a robust, woody trunk covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Cibotium glaucum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests.</p>
