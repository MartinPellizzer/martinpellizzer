                    <h1>Callitropsis macnabiana</h1>
<p>Callitropsis macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab's cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
