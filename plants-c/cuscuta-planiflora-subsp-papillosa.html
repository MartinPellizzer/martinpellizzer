<p>Cuscuta planiflora subsp.</p>
<p>papillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to and extract resources from its host.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to regions in North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves rapid growth and reproduction, often leading to the decline of its host plants.</p>
