                    <h1>Ctenodon mucronulatus</h1>
<p>Ctenodon mucronulatus, commonly known as the slender spinytail skink, is a small, legless lizard native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scincidae and is characterized by its elongated body and spiny scales. The plant-like appearance of its body, with segmented scales, can sometimes lead to confusion with certain succulent plants. While not a plant, it is often found in habitats near vegetation, such as shrubs and low-growing plants.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is primarily that of a predator, feeding on small invertebrates and contributing to the balance of its ecosystem.</p>
