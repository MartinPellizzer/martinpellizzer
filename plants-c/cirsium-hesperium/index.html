                            <h1>Cirsium Hesperium</h1>
<p>Hesperian thistle, scientifically known as Cirsium hesperium, is a striking member of the sunflower family native to the western United States. This plant is easily recognized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. Often found in dry, rocky habitats, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife. Despite its tough exterior, the thistle has a delicate beauty that captivates nature enthusiasts. Its resilience in harsh environments makes it a symbol of adaptation and endurance in the wild.</p>
