                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabratum" suggests a reduced hair coverage compared to the typical form. Its flowers are white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments where it contributes to the alpine flora.</p>
