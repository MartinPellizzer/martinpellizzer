                    <h1>Canthium korrorense</h1>
<p>Canthium korrorense, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, adapted for dispersal by water. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Canthium korrorense plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
