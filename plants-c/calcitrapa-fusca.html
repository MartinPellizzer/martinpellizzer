                    <h1>Calcitrapa fusca</h1>
<p>Calcitrapa fusca, commonly known as the brown sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to brownish in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calcitrapa fusca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
