<p>Ctenitis croftii, commonly known as the croft's sea holly, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. Native to the coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in maritime climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
