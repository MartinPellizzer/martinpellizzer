<p>Cotyledon salmiana, commonly known as the Salm's cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Cotyledon salmiana is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
