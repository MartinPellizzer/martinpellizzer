                    <h1>Chenolea eriophora</h1>
<p>Chenolea eriophora, commonly known as the woolly chenopod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in low, compact clusters, with small, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, while its roots are extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Chenolea eriophora plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert fauna.</p>
