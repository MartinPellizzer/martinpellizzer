<p>Campanula cochleariifolia subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as the bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy undersides, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like flowers.</p>
