                    <h1>Crataegus monogyna f. ferox</h1>
<p>Crataegus monogyna f. ferox, commonly known as the bristly hawthorn, is a variant of the common hawthorn native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a slightly rough texture. This form is distinguished by its more aggressive growth habit and increased thorn density compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to its ecological significance as a habitat-forming plant.</p>
