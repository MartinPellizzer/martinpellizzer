                    <h1>Copaifera tessmannii</h1>
<p>Copaifera tessmannii, commonly known as the Amazonian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to the dense rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and long, drooping branches that often hang over the forest floor. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a valuable resin, known as copaiba balsam, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
