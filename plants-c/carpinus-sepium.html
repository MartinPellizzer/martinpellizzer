<p>Carpinus sepium, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grey bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carpinus sepium is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
