                    <h1>Corallorhiza virescens</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza virescens, commonly known as the green coral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its dependence on fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
