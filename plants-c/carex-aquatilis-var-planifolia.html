<p>Carex aquatilis var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically green and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or floating on the water's surface.
