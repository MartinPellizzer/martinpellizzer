                    <h1>Ctenitis hemsleyana</h1>
<p>Ctenitis hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or pendulous in appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests. The fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
