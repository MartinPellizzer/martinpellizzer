                    <h1>Creatantha</h1>
<p>Creatantha, commonly known as the "milkweed of the mountains," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, often pink or red, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Creatantha species also produce a milky sap that can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
