                            <h1>Capsella Bursa-Pastoris Subsp. Heegeri</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris subsp. heegeri is a lesser-known variant of the common weed known as wild mustard. This subspecies is characterized by its unique leaf shape and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to its broader relatives. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides or in gardens. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for pollinators. Its study offers insights into plant adaptation and genetic diversity within the genus Capsella.</p>
