                    <h1>Comoneura</h1>
<p>Comoneura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Comoneura thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swamp forests or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
