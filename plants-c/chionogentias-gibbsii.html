<p>Chionogentias gibbsii, commonly known as the Gibbs' snow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the short summer season. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
