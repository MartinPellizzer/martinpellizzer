                    <h1>Centrosema dasyanthum f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Centrosema dasyanthum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy centrosema, is a variant of the Centrosema dasyanthum species, which is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>This plant is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a climbing habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The 'pubescens' form is distinguished by its dense pubescence, or fine hairs, covering its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
