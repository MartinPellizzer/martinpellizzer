                    <h1>Cactus nobilis</h1>
<p>Cactus nobilis, commonly known as the noble cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
