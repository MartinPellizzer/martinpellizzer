                    <h1>Cerastium polymorphum var. visciculum</h1>
<p>Cerastium polymorphum var. visciculum, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats.</p>
