<p>It typically grows in shady, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland habitats.</p>
