                    <h1>Coluria purdomii</h1>
<p>Coluria purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's coluria, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, usually from June to August, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coluria purdomii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
