<p>Cuscuta lucidicarpa, commonly known as the shining dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
