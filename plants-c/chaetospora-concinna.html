<p>Chaetospora concinna, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with bright yellow to golden-green leaves that are often arranged in a star-like pattern. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface.</p>
<p>Chaetospora concinna plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
