                    <h1>Cereus flagelliformis var. minor</h1>
<p>Cereus flagelliformis var. minor, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored crown, which is typically a different hue than its green, stem-like body. The plant's stem is cylindrical and segmented, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces night-blooming flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
