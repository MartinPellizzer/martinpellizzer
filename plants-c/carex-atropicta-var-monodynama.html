<p>Carex atropicta var. monodynama, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to wetland and bog environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark purple to blackish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark, berry-like seed capsules. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking coloration and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
