                    <h1>Celastrus cuneatus</h1>
<p>Celastrus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
