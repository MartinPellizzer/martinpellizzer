<p>Crataegus × androssovii, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata.</p>
<p>It typically has thorny branches and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant bears red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
