                <h1>Chionochloa crassiuscula</h1>
<p>Chionochloa crassiuscula, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant has dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
