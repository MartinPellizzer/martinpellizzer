<p>Cypella nivea, commonly known as the snow cypella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella nivea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
