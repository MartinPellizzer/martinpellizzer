<p>Koehne's catalpa, scientifically known as Catalpa bignonioides f. koehnei, is a unique variant of the catalpa tree native to the southeastern United States. This plant is distinguished by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant's compact growth habit and seasonal beauty make it a valuable addition to native plant collections. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Koehne's catalpa is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
