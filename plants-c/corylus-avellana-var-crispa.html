                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. crispa</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. crispa, commonly known as the curly hazel, is a variety of the common hazel characterized by its uniquely curled leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its nuts. The leaves are typically narrow, with a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible hazelnuts in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedge planting.</p>
