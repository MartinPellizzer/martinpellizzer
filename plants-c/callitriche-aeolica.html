                    <h1>Callitriche aeolica</h1>
<p>Callitriche aeolica, commonly known as the windflower, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, where it can thrive in moist or submerged conditions. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Callitriche aeolica is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, often forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water, making it an important species in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
