<p>Cycas aenigma, commonly known as the mysterious cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas aenigma is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
