<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
