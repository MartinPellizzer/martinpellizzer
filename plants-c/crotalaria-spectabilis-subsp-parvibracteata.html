<p>Crotalaria spectabilis subsp.</p>
<p>parvibracteata, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its yellow, spurred flowers and distinctive pod-like seed capsules.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often as a hemiparasite, drawing nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological restoration for its ability to suppress grass growth and promote biodiversity in native plant communities.</p>
