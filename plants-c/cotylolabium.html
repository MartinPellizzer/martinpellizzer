<p>Cotylolabium, commonly known as the "flowering orchid" or "lady's slipper," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often showy flowers that resemble a slipper or pouch, which is formed by the labellum, a specialized petal. The genus includes several species, many of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Cotylolabium plants typically have long, slender stems and are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in the diverse ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
