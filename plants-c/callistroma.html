                    <h1>Callistroma</h1>
<p>Callistroma, commonly known as the false holly or sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They are native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with sandy or saline soils. Callistroma species are often found in dune environments, where they play a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Their unique adaptations to coastal conditions make them important components of maritime ecosystems.</p>
