<p>Callitriche fallax, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with small, floating leaves that are oval-shaped and smooth. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and they bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Callitriche fallax plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
