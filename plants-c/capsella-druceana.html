<p>Capsella druceana, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Capsella druceana is valued in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
