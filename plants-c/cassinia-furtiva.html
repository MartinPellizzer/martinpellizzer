                    <h1>Cassinia furtiva</h1>
<p>Cassinia furtiva, commonly known as the ghost bush, is a small, woody shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Cassinia furtiva is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
