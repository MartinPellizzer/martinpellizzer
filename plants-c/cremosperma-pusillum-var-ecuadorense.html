                    <h1>Cremosperma pusillum var. ecuadorense</h1>
<p>Cremosperma pusillum var. ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
