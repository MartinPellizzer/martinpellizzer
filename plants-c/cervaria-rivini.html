                    <h1>Cervaria rivini</h1>
<p>Cervaria rivini, commonly known as the water bladder, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Cervariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water's surface. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its simple morphology includes a single, elongated stem with a single leaf and a terminal bladder.</p>
<p>Cervaria rivini plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, primarily as a food source for small invertebrates and herbivorous fish.</p>
