                    <h1>Cypripedium gracile</h1>
<p>Cypripedium gracile, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green to brownish stems and its distinctive, loose clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a loose spiral along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium gracile is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
