<p>Carissa edulis var. major, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often too tart for most palates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates.</p>
<p>The Natal plum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife.</p>
