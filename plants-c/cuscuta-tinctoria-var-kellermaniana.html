                    <h1>Cuscuta tinctoria var. kellermaniana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tinctoria var. kellermaniana, commonly known as the red root dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to host plants, and subsequent flowering. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found parasitizing crops such as beans and cotton. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
