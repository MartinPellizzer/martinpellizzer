                    <h1>Calligonum chinense</h1>
<p>Calligonum chinense, commonly known as Chinese sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Calligonum chinense is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
