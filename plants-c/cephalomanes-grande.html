<p>Cephalomanes grande, commonly known as the large-headed manatee grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cephalomanes grande plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
