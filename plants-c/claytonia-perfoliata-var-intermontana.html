                    <h1>Claytonia perfoliata var. intermontana</h1>
<p>Claytonia perfoliata var. intermontana, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure, which appears to "perfoliate" the stem, is a notable botanical feature.</p>
