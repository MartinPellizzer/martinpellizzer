                <h1>Cathormion dinklagei</h1>
<p>Cathormion dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate, slender stem with a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
