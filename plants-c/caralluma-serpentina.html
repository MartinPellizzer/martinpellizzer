<p>Caralluma serpentina, commonly known as the serpent's tail or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its fleshy stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
