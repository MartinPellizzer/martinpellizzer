<p>Calandrinia patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calandrinia patagonica is often found in coastal and inland desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
