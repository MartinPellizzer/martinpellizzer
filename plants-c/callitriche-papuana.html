                    <h1>Callitriche papuana</h1>
<p>Callitriche papuana, commonly known as the Papuan water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, and has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which attract pollinators like insects. Its leaves are narrow and whorled, often floating on the water or submerged in the mud.</p>
<p>Callitriche papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
