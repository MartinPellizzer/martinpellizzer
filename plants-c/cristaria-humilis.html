<p>Cristaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
