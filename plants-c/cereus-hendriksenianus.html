<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the holiday season.

Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spine-like structures, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that turn pink as they mature.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and seasonal blooming habit.</p>
