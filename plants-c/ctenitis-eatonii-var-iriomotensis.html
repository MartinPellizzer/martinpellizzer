<p>Ctenitis eatonii var. iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ctenophyll, is a rare fern native to the island of Iriomote in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
