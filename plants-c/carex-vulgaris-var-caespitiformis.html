The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form compact clumps or dense stands.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
