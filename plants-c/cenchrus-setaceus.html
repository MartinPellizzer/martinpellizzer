                    <h1>Cenchrus setaceus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus setaceus, commonly known as the bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
