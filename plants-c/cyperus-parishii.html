                    <h1>Cyperus parishii</h1>
<p>Cyperus parishii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus parishii thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and propagation.</p>
