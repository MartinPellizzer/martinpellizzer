<p>Coelogyne plantaginea, commonly known as the orchid of the forest, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and the production of multiple fleshy, lance-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent yellow lips, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Coelogyne plantaginea is valued for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
