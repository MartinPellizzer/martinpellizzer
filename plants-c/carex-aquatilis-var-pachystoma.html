                    <h1>Carex aquatilis var. pachystoma</h1>
<p>Carex aquatilis var. pachystoma, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
