                <h1>Ctenitis refulgens</h1>
<p>Ctenitis refulgens, commonly known as the glittering holly fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that emit a shimmering appearance due to the presence of calcareous spore cases. Its spores are released in autumn, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory.</p>
<p>Ctenitis refulgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
