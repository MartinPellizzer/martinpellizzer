                    <h1>Cousinia hypopolia var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Cousinia hypopolia var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries.</p>
