<p>Carex capitata var. arctogena, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
