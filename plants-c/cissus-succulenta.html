<p>Cissus succulenta, commonly known as the stonecrop cissus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, rounded leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. Its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets.</p>
<p>Cissus succulenta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>
