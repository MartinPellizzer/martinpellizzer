                <h1>Cheilanthes bryopoda</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes bryopoda, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact fronds and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes bryopoda is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
