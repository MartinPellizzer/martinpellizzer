                    <h1>Cardamine uliginosa f. pumila</h1>
<p>Cardamine uliginosa f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, often emerging from the base of the foliage. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants.</p>
<p>This fern-like species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
