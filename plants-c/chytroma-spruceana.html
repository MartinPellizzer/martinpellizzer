<p>Chytroma spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce Mountain lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, irregularly lobed structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on decaying wood in forested areas, particularly in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
