<p>Carex hispida subsp.</p>
<p>retusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually broader and more robust than those of other sedges, with a rough, bristly texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
