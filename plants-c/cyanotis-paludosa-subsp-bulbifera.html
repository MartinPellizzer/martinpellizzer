                    <h1>Cyanotis paludosa subsp. bulbifera</h1>
<p>Cyanotis paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>bulbifera, commonly known as the marsh bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ability to produce bulb-like structures, which serve as storage organs and aid in vegetative propagation. These bulbs allow the plant to survive in waterlogged soils and regenerate after flooding.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
