<p>Coronilla coronata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Its small, rounded leaves and compact growth habit make it a low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
