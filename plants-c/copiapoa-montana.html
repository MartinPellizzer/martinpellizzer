<p>Copiapoa montana, commonly known as the mountain copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the coastal deserts of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces white to yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Copiapoa montana is also characterized by its dense, spiny areoles that support both flowers and branches.</p>
