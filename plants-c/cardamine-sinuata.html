<p>Cardamine sinuata, commonly known as the wavy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a wavy edge, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wet soils along streams and marshes.</p>
<p>Cardamine sinuata is often found in shaded, damp environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
