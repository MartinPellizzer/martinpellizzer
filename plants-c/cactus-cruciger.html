                    <h1>Cactus cruciger</h1>
<p>Cactus cruciger, commonly known as the cross-cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Native to the arid regions of South America, it has adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick stems make it a resilient and fascinating botanical specimen.</p>
