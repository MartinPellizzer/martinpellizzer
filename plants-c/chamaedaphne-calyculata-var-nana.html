                    <h1>Chamaedaphne calyculata var. nana</h1>
<p>Chamaedaphne calyculata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf swamp waxmyrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in wetland environments, such as bogs and swamps, where it forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and white underneath, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in the fall and are followed by bright red berries that persist through winter.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact size and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
