                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. macrostemon</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. macrostemon, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
