                    <h1>Cyathea pibyae</h1>
<p>Cyathea pibyae, commonly known as the Piby's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea pibyae typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
