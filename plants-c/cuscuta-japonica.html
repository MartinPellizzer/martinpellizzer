                    <h1>Cuscuta japonica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta japonica, commonly known as Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering host plants within weeks. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to wrap around and attach to various host species. It is native to East Asia and can be found on a wide range of plants, including crops and ornamentals.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
