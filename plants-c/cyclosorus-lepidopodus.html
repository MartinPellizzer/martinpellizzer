                    <h1>Cyclosorus lepidopodus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus lepidopodus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, mat-forming fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The velvet fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
