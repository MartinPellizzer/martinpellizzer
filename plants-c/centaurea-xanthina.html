<p>Centaurea xanthina, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native areas.</p>
<p>Centaurea xanthina has been introduced to various parts of the world, where it can compete with native vegetation.</p>
