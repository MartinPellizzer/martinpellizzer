<p>Chondrilla pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and a low water requirement.</p>
<p>Chondrilla pinnatifida is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
