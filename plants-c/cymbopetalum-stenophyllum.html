                    <h1>Cymbopetalum stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Cymbopetalum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cymbopetalum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>
