<p>Chamaesyce koerneriana, commonly known as the Koerner's spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
