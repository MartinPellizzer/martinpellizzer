                    <h1>Cereus quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Cereus quadrangularis, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that bloom at night, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is a succulent that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the moon cactus is not a single species but a hybrid between Cereus and other genera, often grafted onto a different cactus rootstock.</p>
