                    <h1>Coryanthes dasilvae</h1>
<p>Coryanthes dasilvae, commonly known as the Sunda ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks and branches of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are predominantly white with a deep purple or black hue, and they emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Coryanthes dasilvae is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
