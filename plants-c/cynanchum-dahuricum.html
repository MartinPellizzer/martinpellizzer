                    <h1>Cynanchum dahuricum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian milk-vine, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is known for its medicinal properties, though its sap contains cardiac glycosides that can be harmful.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided in traditional herbal practices.</p>
