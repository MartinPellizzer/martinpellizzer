<p>Cardamine flaccida subsp.</p>
<p>alsophila, commonly known as the Alsophila watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10â€“20 cm.</p>
<p>The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
