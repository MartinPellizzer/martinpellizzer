                    <h1>Cayratia cannabina</h1>
<p>Cayratia cannabina, commonly known as the Indian hemp vine, is a climbing plant native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to Cannabis species, it has been the subject of botanical and legal scrutiny in some regions.</p>
