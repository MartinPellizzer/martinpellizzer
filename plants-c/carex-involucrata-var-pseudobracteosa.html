<p>Carex involucrata var. pseudobracteosa, commonly known as the false bract sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively and establish in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of two to three spikelets, with the lower spikelet often reduced or sterile, giving it its common name.</p>
