<p>Convolvulus tenuissimus var. virescens, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a prominent, slender tube. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly soils and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its delicate appearance.</p>
