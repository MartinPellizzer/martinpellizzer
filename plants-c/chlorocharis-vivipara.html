<p>Chlorocharis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a thalloid plant characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy known as viviparity, where the female gametophyte produces embryos that are released as free-living structures. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the thallus.</p>
<p>Chlorocharis vivipara plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
