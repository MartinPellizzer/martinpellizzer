                    <h1>Cassytha umbellata</h1>
<p>Cassytha umbellata, commonly known as the parasitic vine or sweet vining plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has slender, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often winding around other vegetation. Its small, opposite leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Cassytha umbellata is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
