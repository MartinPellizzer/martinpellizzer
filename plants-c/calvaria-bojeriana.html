                    <h1>Calvaria bojeriana</h1>
<p>Calvaria bojeriana, commonly known as the African helmet plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, helmet-like structure at the top of its stems, which is a modified inflorescence called a cyathium. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered within the cup-shaped structure. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calvaria bojeriana is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
