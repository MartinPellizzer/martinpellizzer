                    <h1>Cypripedium × schroederae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × schroederae, commonly known as the Schröder's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
