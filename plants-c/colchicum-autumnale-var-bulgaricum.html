                    <h1>Colchicum autumnale var. bulgaricum</h1>
<p>Colchicum autumnale var. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Bulgarian autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a corm-like structure that serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are basal, broad, and arrow-shaped, typically appearing after the flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the more widely known Colchicum autumnale, sharing similar toxic properties due to the presence of colchicine.</p>
