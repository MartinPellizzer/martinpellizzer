                    <h1>Cirsium lappaceum var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Cirsium lappaceum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, fuzzy, purple-blue flowering heads that appear in summer. The leaves are broadly lance-shaped, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other thistle species within the Cirsium genus, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits.</p>
