                    <h1>Conophytum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Conophytum divaricatum, commonly known as the "Rainbow Stones," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Conophytum divaricatum is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
