                    <h1>Clavula palustris</h1>
<p>Clavula palustris, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and club-shaped strobila that produce spores. The plant typically grows in dense mats, often forming part of the understory in moist, shaded environments. Clavula palustris thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, hydric habitats.</p>
