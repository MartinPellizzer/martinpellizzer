                    <h1>Cactus robustispinus</h1>
<p>Cactus robustispinus, commonly known as the robust spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The cactus also has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall.</p>
