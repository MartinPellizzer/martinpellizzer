                    <h1>Cheilanthes scariosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes scariosa, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often adorned with fringes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes scariosa is often found growing on limestone or granite outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
