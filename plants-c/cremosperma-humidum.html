<p>Cremosperma humidum, commonly known as the wetland mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of trees and shrubs, drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds and other animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cremosperma humidum plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
