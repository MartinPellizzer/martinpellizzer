                    <h1>Chamaefistula deficiens</h1>
<p>Chamaefistula deficiens, commonly known as the sparseleaf boxthorn, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
