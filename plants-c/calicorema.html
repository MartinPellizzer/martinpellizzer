<p>Calicorema, commonly known as the "bottlebrush tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits that resemble small bottles. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, and the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Calicorema species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
