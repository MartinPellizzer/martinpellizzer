                    <h1>Cladium jamaicense</h1>
<p>Cladium jamaicense, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial marsh plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves with serrated edges that resemble a saw, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems. Sawgrass forms dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes and roots help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in marshy areas.</p>
