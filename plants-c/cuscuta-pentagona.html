<p>Cuscuta pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona plays a role in ecological systems by affecting the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
