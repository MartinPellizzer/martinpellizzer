                    <h1>Canthium barbatum f. calcicola</h1>
<p>Canthium barbatum f. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicole canthium, is a variant of the genus Canthium native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its subspecific name "calcicola," meaning "calcium dweller.". Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
