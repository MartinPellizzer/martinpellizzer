The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
