                    <h1>Cactus lanuginosus</h1>
<p>Cactus lanuginosus, commonly known as the wooly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy covering of pale gray or white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its textured appearance. Its stems are typically cylindrical and segmented, with spines that provide additional protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This resilient plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
