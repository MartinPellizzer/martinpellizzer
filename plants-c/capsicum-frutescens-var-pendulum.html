The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with its pendulous growth habit making it ideal for hanging baskets or containers. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and the fruit, when mature, can be red, yellow, or orange.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
