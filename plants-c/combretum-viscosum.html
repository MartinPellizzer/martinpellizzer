<p>Combretum viscosum, commonly known as sticky combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, often sticky bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds.</p>
<p>Combretum viscosum is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
