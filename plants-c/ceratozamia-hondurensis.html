                    <h1>Ceratozamia hondurensis</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
