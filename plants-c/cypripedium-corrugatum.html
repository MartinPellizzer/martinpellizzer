                    <h1>Cypripedium corrugatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium corrugatum, commonly known as the wrinkled lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to moist, shaded environments. It thrives in rich, organic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
