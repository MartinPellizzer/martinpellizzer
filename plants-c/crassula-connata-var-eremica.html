                    <h1>Crassula connata var. eremica</h1>
<p>Crassula connata var. eremica, commonly known as the Desert Crassula, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
