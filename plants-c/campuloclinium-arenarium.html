<p>Campuloclinium arenarium, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Campuloclinium arenarium is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
