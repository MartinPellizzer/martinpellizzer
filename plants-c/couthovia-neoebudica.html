                    <h1>Couthovia neoebudica</h1>
<p>Couthovia neoebudica, commonly known as the silverleaf starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it thrive in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species.</p>
