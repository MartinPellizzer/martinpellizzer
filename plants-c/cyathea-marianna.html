                    <h1>Cyathea marianna</h1>
<p>Cyathea marianna, commonly known as the Marianna tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes Cyathea marianna a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
