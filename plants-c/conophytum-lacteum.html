                    <h1>Conophytum lacteum</h1>
<p>Conophytum lacteum, commonly known as the milk conophytum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, basal leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum lacteum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
