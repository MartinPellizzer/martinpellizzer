<p>Camaridium strumatum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, primarily tiny crustaceans and insect larvae. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has thin, branched stems with whorled leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often appearing in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Camaridium strumatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
