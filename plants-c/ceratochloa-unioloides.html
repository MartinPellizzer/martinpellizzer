                    <h1>Ceratochloa unioloides</h1>
<p>Ceratochloa unioloides, commonly known as the slender water millet, is a small annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to spread efficiently in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
