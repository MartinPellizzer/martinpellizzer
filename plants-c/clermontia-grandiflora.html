                    <h1>Clermontia grandiflora</h1>
<p>Clermontia grandiflora, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, succulent leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in the high-altitude, volcanic soils of the Haleakalā crater, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
