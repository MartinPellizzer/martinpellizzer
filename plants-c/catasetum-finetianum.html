<p>Catasetum finetianum, commonly known as the Finetian Catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces specialized structures called pollinia, which are adapted for attachment to the bodies of its pollinators, primarily bees. Its growth habit is sympodial, meaning it grows in a series of shoots that arise from the base of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Catasetum finetianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth.</p>
