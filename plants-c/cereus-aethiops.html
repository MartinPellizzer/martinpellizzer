                    <h1>Cereus aethiops</h1>
<p>Cereus aethiops, commonly known as the Natal Thorn, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and flowering habits are adaptations to its native habitat, where it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
