                    <h1>Cumulopuntia echinacea</h1>
<p>Cumulopuntia echinacea, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The hedgehog cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in desert gardens due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
