                    <h1>Cuscuta tuberculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tuberculata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is native to North America and can be found on various host species such as grasses and forbs. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host, establishing a connection, and then producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
