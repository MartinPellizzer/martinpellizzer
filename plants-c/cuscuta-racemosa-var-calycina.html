                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. calycina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. calycina, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that wraps around its host, forming a symbiotic relationship. It is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
