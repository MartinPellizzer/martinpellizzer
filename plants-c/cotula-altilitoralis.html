                    <h1>Cotula altilitoralis</h1>
<p>Cotula altilitoralis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Cotula altilitoralis is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
