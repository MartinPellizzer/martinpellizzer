<p>Craterispermum praslinense, commonly known as the Praslin Island cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
