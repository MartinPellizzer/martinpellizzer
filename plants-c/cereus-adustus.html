<p>Cereus adustus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of pink, white, or red. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cereus adustus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
