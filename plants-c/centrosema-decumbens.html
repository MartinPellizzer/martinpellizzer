                    <h1>Centrosema decumbens</h1>
<p>Centrosema decumbens, commonly known as hairy beggar's tick, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
