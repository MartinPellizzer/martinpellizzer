                    <h1>Celosia spicata var. holostachya</h1>
<p>Celosia spicata var. holostachya, commonly known as the flameflower or crested flame grass, is a striking ornamental plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feather-like bracts that form a spiky, flame-like appearance, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bract clusters, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its vibrant colors, ranging from red to orange and yellow, add a dramatic visual impact to landscapes.</p>
