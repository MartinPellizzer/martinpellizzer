                    <h1>Carpha alpina</h1>
<p>Carpha alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Carpha alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
