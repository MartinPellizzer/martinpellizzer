<p>Carex breviculmis subsp.</p>
<p>fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous, hairy texture distinguishes it from other sedges and contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
