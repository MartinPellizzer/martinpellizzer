<p>Codonandra, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance due to the dense covering of fine, white hairs on its stems and leaves. The plants typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Codonandra species are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique, cloud-like appearance.</p>
<p>They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
