<p>Commiphora unilobata, commonly known as the wild myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
