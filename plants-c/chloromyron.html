                    <h1>Chloromyron</h1>
<p>Chloromyron, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange color, which comes from the presence of various pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. This lichen typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>Chloromyron plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
