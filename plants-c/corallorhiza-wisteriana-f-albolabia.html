                    <h1>Corallorhiza wisteriana f. albolabia</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza wisteriana f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, labiate (lip-like) structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with hardwood trees. Its flowers are arranged in a loose inflorescence and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
