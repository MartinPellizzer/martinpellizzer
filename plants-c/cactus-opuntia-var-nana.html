                    <h1>Cactus opuntia var. nana</h1>
<p>Cactus opuntia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features short, rounded stems covered in small, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Opuntia genus. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
