                    <h1>Cycas semota</h1>
<p>Cycas semota, commonly known as the Sunda cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
