<p>Cuspidia cernua subsp.</p>
<p>annua, commonly known as the annual bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has small, opposite leaves and produces small white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its short life cycle, it is often found in disturbed or temporary water bodies.</p>
