                    <h1>Cardamine rostrata var. reniformis</h1>
<p>Cardamine rostrata var. reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide structural support in aquatic environments.</p>
