                    <h1>Cyathea mesocarpa</h1>
<p>Cyathea mesocarpa, commonly known as the medium-fruited tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili, a feature typical of many ferns. Cyathea mesocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems.</p>
