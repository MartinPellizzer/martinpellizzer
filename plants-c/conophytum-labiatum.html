<p>Conophytum labiatum, commonly known as the "Lip-shaped Namaqualand Cactus," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem that often remains hidden beneath the soil, with fleshy, ribbed leaves that emerge during the rainy season. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Conophytum labiatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
