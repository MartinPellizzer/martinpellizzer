<p>Cistus coridifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cistus coridifolius is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
