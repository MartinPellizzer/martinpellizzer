                    <h1>Chaerophyllum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum, commonly known as hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and tall, hollow stems that often have a purple or greenish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, a feature common to many members of the carrot family. Chaerophyllum species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and some are cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, certain species can be toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
