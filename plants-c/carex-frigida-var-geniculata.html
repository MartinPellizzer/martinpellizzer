<p>It has grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its cold-hardy nature, it is a key component of the vegetation in high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
