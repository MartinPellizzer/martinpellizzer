                    <h1>Cephalomanes densinervium</h1>
<p>Cephalomanes densinervium, commonly known as the dense-veined headman, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent, dense veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
