                    <h1>Cyrtophyllum caudatum</h1>
<p>Cyrtophyllum caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tropical plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
