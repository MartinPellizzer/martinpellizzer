                    <h1>Cynoglossum lappula</h1>
<p>Cynoglossum lappula, commonly known as liverworts, is a type of non-vascular plant that belongs to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is a flat, leaf-like structure that can vary in shape and size. Liverworts typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. They play an important role in ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitats for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to their simple structure and ancient lineage, they are considered one of the earliest land plants.</p>
