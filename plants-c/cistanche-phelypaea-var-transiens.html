                    <h1>Cistanche phelypaea var. transiens</h1>
<p>Cistanche phelypaea var. transiens, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
