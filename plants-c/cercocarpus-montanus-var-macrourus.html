<p>Cercocarpus montanus var. macrourus, commonly known as the bigleaf curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
