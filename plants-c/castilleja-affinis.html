                    <h1>Castilleja affinis</h1>
<p>Castilleja affinis, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble a brush. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific host plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals.</p>
<p>Castilleja affinis is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>
