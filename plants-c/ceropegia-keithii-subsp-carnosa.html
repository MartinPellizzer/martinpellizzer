<p>Ceropegia keithii subsp.</p>
<p>carnosa, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
