<p>Campylocentrum hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
