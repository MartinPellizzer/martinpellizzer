                    <h1>Coffea abeokutae var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Coffea abeokutae var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Kukutu coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee native to parts of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spherical berries and a unique flavor profile that differs from more widely cultivated coffee varieties. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, thriving in high humidity and rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, while the flowers are white and fragrant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in the coffee plant family.</p>
