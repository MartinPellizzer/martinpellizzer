<p>Cathartolinum orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba cathartolinum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
