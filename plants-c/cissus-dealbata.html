<p>Cissus dealbata, commonly known as the silver leaf creeper, is a vigorous trailing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost silvery-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Cissus dealbata is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening.</p>
