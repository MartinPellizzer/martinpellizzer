<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats.</p>
<p>Croixia gutta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens.</p>
