                    <h1>Cochlearia officinalis var. aestuaria</h1>
<p>Cochlearia officinalis var. aestuaria, commonly known as the sea kale, is a coastal plant adapted to salty, maritime environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in the British Isles and northern Europe.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source in coastal communities adds to its cultural significance.</p>
