<p>It is a small annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
