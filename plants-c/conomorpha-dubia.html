                    <h1>Conomorpha dubia</h1>
<p>Conomorpha dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Conomorpha dubia has a unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its roots from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
