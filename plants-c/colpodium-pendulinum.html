                    <h1>Colpodium pendulinum</h1>
<p>Colpodium pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that often hang from the vegetation in water bodies. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
