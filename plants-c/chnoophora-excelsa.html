                    <h1>Chnoophora excelsa</h1>
<p>Chnoophora excelsa, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in marshy environments and is often found in brackish or freshwater habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for wetland restoration projects.</p>
