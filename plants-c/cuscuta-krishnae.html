                    <h1>Cuscuta krishnae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta krishnae, commonly known as Krishna's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around and attach to the stems of its host, typically other flowering plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to parts of South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
