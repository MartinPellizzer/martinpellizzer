                    <h1>Cyclophorus rasamalae</h1>
<p>Cyclophorus rasamalae, commonly known as the Rasamalae cyclophorus, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the wet season. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its ecological role and reproductive habits.</p>
