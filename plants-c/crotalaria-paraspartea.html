<p>Crotalaria paraspartea, commonly known as the parasitic crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is native to parts of Africa and Asia. The plant exhibits a parasitic growth habit, attaching itself to the roots of other plants to derive nutrients. Its leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
