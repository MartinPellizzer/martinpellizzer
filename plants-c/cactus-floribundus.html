<p>Cactus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus floribundus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and vibrant floral displays.</p>
