<p>Cornopteris musashiensis, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble water lilies, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments, and it prefers still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
