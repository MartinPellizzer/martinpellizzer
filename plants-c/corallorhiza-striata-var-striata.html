                    <h1>Corallorhiza striata var. striata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza striata var. striata, commonly known as the stripeless coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, growing in shaded forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, and it lacks true leaves, instead having scale-like structures. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
