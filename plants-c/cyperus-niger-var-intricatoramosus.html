                    <h1>Cyperus niger var. intricatoramosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus niger var. intricatoramosus, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus niger species, characterized by its dark, almost black, leaf blades.</p>
<p>It is a monocot belonging to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often surrounded by a leafy bract, making it distinctive within the genus.</p>
