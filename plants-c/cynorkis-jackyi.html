<p>Cynorkis jackyi, commonly known as the Jacky's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the cycad family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynorkis jackyi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
