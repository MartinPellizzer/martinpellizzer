<p>Carex repens, commonly known as the creeping sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along streambanks.</p>
