<p>Comarum digitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often described as having a finger-like appearance, hence its scientific name. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Comarum digitatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
