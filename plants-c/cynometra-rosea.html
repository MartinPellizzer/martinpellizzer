                    <h1>Cynometra rosea</h1>
<p>Cynometra rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The tree has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several flat, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Cynometra rosea is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
