                    <h1>Corybas ecarinatus</h1>
<p>Corybas ecarinatus, commonly known as the hooded helmet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of many orchids. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a deep purple or violet hue, often with intricate patterns on the labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
