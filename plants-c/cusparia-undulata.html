                    <h1>Cusparia undulata</h1>
<p>Cusparia undulata, commonly known as the wavy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
