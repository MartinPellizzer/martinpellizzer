                    <h1>Campyloneurum macbridei</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves that are arranged in dense, spiraled clusters around the stem. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages and their adaptations.</p>
