                    <h1>Cavaraea</h1>
<p>Cavaraea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Southeast Asia, Cavaraea thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, Cavaraea is often considered an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
