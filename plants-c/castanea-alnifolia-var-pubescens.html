                    <h1>Castanea alnifolia var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Castanea alnifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy chestnut, is a variant of the chestnut tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy foliage and bark, which distinguish it from other chestnut species. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain edible nuts, although the nuts are typically smaller and less abundant than those of the common chestnut. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland areas.</p>
<p>The hairy chestnut is valued for its ornamental features and historical use in local ecosystems.</p>
