                    <h1>Carex flacca var. silvatica</h1>
<p>Carex flacca var. silvatica, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that is typically soft and silky to the touch, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
