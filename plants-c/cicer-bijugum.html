                    <h1>Cicer bijugum</h1>
<p>Cicer bijugum, commonly known as the two-winged vetch, is a leguminous plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with two pairs of opposite leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Cicer bijugum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbanks.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
