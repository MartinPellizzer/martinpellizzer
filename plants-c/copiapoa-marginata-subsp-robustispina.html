<p>Copiapoa marginata subsp.</p>
<p>robustispina, commonly known as the robust spined cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores.</p>

<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular species among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
