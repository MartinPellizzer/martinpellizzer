<p>Chrysosplenium epigealum, commonly known as the creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time.</p>
