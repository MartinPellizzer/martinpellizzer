                    <h1>Cactus lividus</h1>
<p>Cactus lividus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue-gray stems, which are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate flowers, the ghost cactus is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established.</p>
