                    <h1>Cyanea grimesiana var. lydgatei</h1>
<p>Cyanea grimesiana var. lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's Cyanea, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane rainforest habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
