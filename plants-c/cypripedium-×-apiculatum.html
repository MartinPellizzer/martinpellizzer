                    <h1>Cypripedium × apiculatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × apiculatum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium × mackayi.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip that serves as a nectar trap to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and has tall, upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a prominent central spur that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
