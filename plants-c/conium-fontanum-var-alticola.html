                    <h1>Conium fontanum var. alticola</h1>
<p>Conium fontanum var. alticola, commonly known as the Alpine hemlock, is a rare variant of the hemlock plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers in the summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits that disperse by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
