                    <h1>Cladium micranthes</h1>
<p>Cladium micranthes, commonly known as the small-flowered sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and small, white or pale green flowers that appear in spike-like clusters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often waterlogged habitat. Cladium micranthes plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of these wetland habitats.</p>
