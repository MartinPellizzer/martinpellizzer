                    <h1>Carex accrescens var. sylvipaludosa</h1>
<p>Carex accrescens var. sylvipaludosa, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays an important ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
