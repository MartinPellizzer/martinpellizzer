                    <h1>Carex intermedia f. floribunda</h1>
<p>Carex intermedia f. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This ornamental and ecological plant is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
