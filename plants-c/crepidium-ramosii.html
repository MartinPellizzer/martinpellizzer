<p>Crepidium ramosii, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are often covered in a dense mat of mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
