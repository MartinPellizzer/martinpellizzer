                    <h1>Cephalanthera falcata f. conformis</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera falcata f. conformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and a distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
