                    <h1>Chrysochosma candida var. copelandii</h1>
<p>Chrysochosma candida var. copelandii, commonly known as the white ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are predominantly white with a slight yellowish hue. The plant has a low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
