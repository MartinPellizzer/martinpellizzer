                    <h1>Cheilanthes chaerophylla</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes chaerophylla, commonly known as the rock spurge fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, typically forming dense clusters on rocky outcrops. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes chaerophylla is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
