<p>Cyrtandra filisecta, commonly known as the thread-leaved cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra filisecta is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
