                    <h1>Cysticapnos cirrhoza</h1>
<p>Cysticapnos cirrhoza, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Its unique biology makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
