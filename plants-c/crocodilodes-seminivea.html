                    <h1>Crocodilodes seminivea</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes seminivea, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Crocodilodes seminivea is considered an endangered species.</p>
