<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, lanceolate, often grayish-green leaves.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and rocky ecosystems.</p>
