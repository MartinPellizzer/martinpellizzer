                    <h1>Chenopodium halophilum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium halophilum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high salinity. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of saline ecosystems.</p>
<p>Chenopodium halophilum is also used in phytoremediation to stabilize soil and reduce soil salinity.</p>
