                    <h1>Calycobolus heudelotii</h1>
<p>Calycobolus heudelotii, commonly known as the African snowdrop, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowdrops. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, with six tepals that are fused at the base, forming a cup-like calyx. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calycobolus heudelotii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
