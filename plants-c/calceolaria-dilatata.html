<p>Calceolaria dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf slipperflower, is a member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in high-altitude regions. The plant is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Calceolaria dilatata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight.</p>
