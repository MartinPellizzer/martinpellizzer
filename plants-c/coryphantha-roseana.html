<p>Coryphantha roseana, commonly known as the roseate coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mound-forming plant with pale green stems that are covered in soft, white spines. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha roseana is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
