<p>Coronilla glauca subsp.</p>
<p>pentaphylloides, commonly known as the blue crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple to pink pea-like flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to the typical form of Coronilla glauca.</p>
