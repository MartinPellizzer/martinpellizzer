                    <h1>Campanula napuligera f. longisepala</h1>
<p>Campanula napuligera f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the campanula genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, showy sepals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to typical campanula species. The plant produces bell-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
