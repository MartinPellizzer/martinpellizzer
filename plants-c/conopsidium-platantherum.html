<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant is native to moist, shaded woodlands in eastern North America. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
