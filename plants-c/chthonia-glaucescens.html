                    <h1>Chthonia glaucescens</h1>
<p>Chthonia glaucescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring pale greenish-blue flowers and a slender, often underground stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive, almost translucent texture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Chthonia glaucescens is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
