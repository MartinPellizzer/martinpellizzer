                    <h1>Cypripedium hincksianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium hincksianum, commonly known as the Hinck's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
