                    <h1>Cyphochilus</h1>
<p>Cyphochilus, commonly known as the "spiny orchid," is a genus of small, terrestrial orchids native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>These plants typically have delicate, grass-like leaves and produce small, intricate flowers with specialized structures for attracting specific pollinators. The flowers often feature a unique combination of colors and shapes, including spurred petals and specialized nectar glands. Cyphochilus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role in tropical ecosystems and their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
