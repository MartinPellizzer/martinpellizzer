<p>Crepidium binabayense, commonly known as the Binabay orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or near streams. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
