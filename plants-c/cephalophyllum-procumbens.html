                    <h1>Cephalophyllum procumbens</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping headplant, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum procumbens is valued in rock gardens and xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
