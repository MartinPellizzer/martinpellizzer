                    <h1>Cyclosorus dicarpus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus dicarpus, commonly known as the two-seeded water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include two small, spirally arranged spore cases on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
