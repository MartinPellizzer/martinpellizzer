<p>Centaurea rhizanthoides, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble small stars, surrounded by spiny, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Centaurea rhizanthoides is also known for its ability to reseed itself readily, making it a persistent weed in disturbed areas.</p>
