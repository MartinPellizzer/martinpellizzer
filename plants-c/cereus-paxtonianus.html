                    <h1>Cereus paxtonianus</h1>
<p>Cereus paxtonianus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous cactus that typically grows in arid environments, featuring a tall, spiny stem with prominent areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The flowering period is brief, usually occurring during the warmer months, making it a striking addition to desert landscapes.</p>
