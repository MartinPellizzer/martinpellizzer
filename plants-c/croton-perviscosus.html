                    <h1>Croton perviscosus</h1>
<p>Croton perviscosus, commonly known as the sticky croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its sticky foliage can make it challenging to handle.</p>
