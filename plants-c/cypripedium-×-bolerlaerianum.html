                    <h1>Cypripedium × bolerlaerianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × bolerlaerianum, commonly known as the Bolerlaerian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
