<p>Chenopodium zoellneri, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium zoellneri is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tart flavor and are used in traditional cuisine by some indigenous communities.</p>
