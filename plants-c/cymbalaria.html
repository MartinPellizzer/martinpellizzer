<p>Cymbalaria, commonly known as mouse-ear or cymbal poppy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of purple, pink, or white. They are typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cymbalaria species are perennial herbs that spread through runners, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to their ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
