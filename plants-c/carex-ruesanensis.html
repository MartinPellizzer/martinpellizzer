<p>Carex ruesanensis, commonly known as the Ruesan's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex ruesanensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to filter water.</p>
