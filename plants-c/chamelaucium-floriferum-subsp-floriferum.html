<p>Chamelaucium floriferum subsp.</p>
<p>floriferum, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathland and dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to regenerate after fire, making it an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
