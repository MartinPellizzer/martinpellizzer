<p>Capnorea nana, commonly known as the dwarf capnorea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its flowers bloom in shades of pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Capnorea nana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
