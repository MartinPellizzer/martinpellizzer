                    <h1>Cieca pallida</h1>
<p>Cieca pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies solely on its modified stems and roots for photosynthesis. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly apparition.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cieca pallida is considered critically endangered.</p>
