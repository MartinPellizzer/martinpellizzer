                            <h1>Cleistocalyx Pennelii</h1>
<p>Cleistocalyx pennelii is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is known for its striking, bottle-shaped fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. Its flowers are typically hidden within the fruit, a feature that gives it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistocalyx pennelii is considered an endangered species.</p>
