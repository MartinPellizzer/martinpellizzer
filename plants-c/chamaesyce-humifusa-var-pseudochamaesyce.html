                    <h1>Chamaesyce humifusa var. pseudochamaesyce</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce humifusa var. pseudochamaesyce, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in damp environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed wet soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
