<p>Cyclosorus wailele, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclosorus wailele is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
