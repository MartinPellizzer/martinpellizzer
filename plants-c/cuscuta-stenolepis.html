                    <h1>Cuscuta stenolepis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta stenolepis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
