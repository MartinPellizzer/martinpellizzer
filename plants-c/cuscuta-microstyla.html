                    <h1>Cuscuta microstyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta microstyla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in North America and often infests agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
