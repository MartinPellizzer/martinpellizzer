                    <h1>Crepidium arachnoideum</h1>
<p>Crepidium arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble delicate webbing. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
