<p>Chaetodiscus gilbertii, commonly known as the golden star wort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching growth habit and the presence of small, yellowish-brown rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. The plant typically forms mats on the bottom of freshwater lakes and ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Chaetodiscus gilbertii is adapted to low-light conditions and is often found in nutrient-rich, slow-moving waters.</p>
