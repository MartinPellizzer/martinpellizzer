                    <h1>Cymodocea rotundata</h1>
<p>Cymodocea rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf sea grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a marine angiosperm that thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy seabeds, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically rounded at the tips, which help reduce water resistance. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Cymodocea rotundata is also important for carbon sequestration and supports biodiversity in marine environments.</p>
