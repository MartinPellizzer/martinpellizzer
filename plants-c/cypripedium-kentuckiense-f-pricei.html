                    <h1>Cypripedium kentuckiense f. pricei</h1>
<p>Cypripedium kentuckiense f. pricei, commonly known as the Price's pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often in association with other orchid species. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
