                    <h1>Corallorrhiza</h1>
<p>Corallorrhiza, commonly known as the coral root, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, forming a mycorrhizal relationship to absorb water and minerals. The plant has a delicate, root-like structure that intertwines with the roots of its host, often without causing harm. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, typically growing on trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance, with small, white or pale pink flowers, makes it a striking yet elusive member of the orchid family.</p>
