<p>Colutea hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid false peavine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Colutea hybrida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
