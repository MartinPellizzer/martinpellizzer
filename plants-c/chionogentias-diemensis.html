<p>Chionogentias diemensis, commonly known as the Diemensis Snowplant, is a rare alpine plant native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
