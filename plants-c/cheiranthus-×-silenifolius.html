                    <h1>Cheiranthus × silenifolius</h1>
<p>Cheiranthus × silenifolius, commonly known as the silenifolius wallflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cheiranthus cheiri and Cheiranthus sanguineus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often mistaken for those of the silen (Silenus) genus, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is a perennial herbaceous plant with a fibrous root system and is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
