                    <h1>Citropsis mirabilis</h1>
<p>Citropsis mirabilis, commonly known as the miracle cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, adding a burst of color to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Citropsis mirabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
