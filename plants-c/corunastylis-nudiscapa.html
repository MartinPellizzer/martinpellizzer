<p>Corunastylis nudiscapa, commonly known as the naked-stemmed starwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants such as spiderworts and waterwheel plants.

Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Corunastylis nudiscapa is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
