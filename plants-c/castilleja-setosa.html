<p>Castilleja setosa, commonly known as the sticky false nettle, is a hemiparasitic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants, such as grasses and shrubs. Its structure consists of a slender stem with whorled clusters of flowers and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Castilleja setosa is often found in open habitats, including meadows and woodland edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>
