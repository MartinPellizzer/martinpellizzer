                    <h1>Calanthe</h1>
<p>Calanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and the Himalayas, and are often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Calanthes typically have broad, leathery leaves and produce delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
