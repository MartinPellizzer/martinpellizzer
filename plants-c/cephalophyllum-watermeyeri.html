<p>Cephalophyllum watermeyeri, commonly known as the watermelon cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, globular stem with prominent, ribbed structures that aid in water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits resembling small watermelons. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum watermeyeri is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
