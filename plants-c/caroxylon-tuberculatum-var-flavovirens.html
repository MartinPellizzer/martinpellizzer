                    <h1>Caroxylon tuberculatum var. flavovirens</h1>
<p>Caroxylon tuberculatum var. flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are a striking combination of green and yellow. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and exhibits a slow growth rate. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
