                    <h1>Colocynthis</h1>
<p>Colocynthis, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to the deserts of North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. The plant produces yellow, fleshy fruits that contain a toxic, bitter substance called colocynthin. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are covered in spiny projections.</p>
<p>Colocynthis is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts.</p>
