                    <h1>Chrysophyllum delphinense</h1>
<p>Chrysophyllum delphinense, commonly known as the Delphin's starfruit, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are typically smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some tropical regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes.</p>
