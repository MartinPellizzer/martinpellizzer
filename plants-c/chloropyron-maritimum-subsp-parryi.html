<p>Chloropyron maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>parryi, commonly known as Parry's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, semi-arid conditions.</p>
