                    <h1>Cladocolea sandwithii</h1>
<p>Cladocolea sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's cliffbracken, is a rare fern native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal environments where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with deeply lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of ferns, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
