                    <h1>Campyloneurum costatum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum costatum, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually arranged in a loose, upright cluster.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
