                    <h1>Corchorus psammophilus</h1>
<p>Corchorus psammophilus, commonly known as sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance settings.</p>
