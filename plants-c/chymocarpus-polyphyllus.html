                    <h1>Chymocarpus polyphyllus</h1>
<p>Chymocarpus polyphyllus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, umbrella-shaped seed heads. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its showy inflorescences and adaptability to aquatic environments.</p>
