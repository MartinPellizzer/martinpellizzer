                    <h1>Cynanchum hartii</h1>
<p>Cynanchum hartii, commonly known as Hart's dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Its roots are fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Cynanchum hartii is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
