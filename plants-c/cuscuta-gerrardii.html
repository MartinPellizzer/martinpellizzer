                    <h1>Cuscuta gerrardii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gerrardii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to North America and often infests agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants.</p>
