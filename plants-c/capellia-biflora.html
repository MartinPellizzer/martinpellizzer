                    <h1>Capellia biflora</h1>
<p>Capellia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered capellia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Capellia biflora thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
