                    <h1>Caralluma moniliformis</h1>
<p>Caralluma moniliformis, commonly known as the bead spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that resemble beads, which help it store water for long periods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma moniliformis is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
