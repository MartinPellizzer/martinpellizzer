<p>Campanula alpina f. squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose bellflower, is a variant of the alpine bellflower native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, scale-like leaves that give it its botanical name "squamulosa," meaning "scaly.". The plant produces bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
