<p>Carex dissitiflora subsp.</p>
<p>dissitiflora, commonly known as the soft-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Its inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being longer and more robust.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
