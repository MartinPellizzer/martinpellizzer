<p>Crassula purcellii, commonly known as the White Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
