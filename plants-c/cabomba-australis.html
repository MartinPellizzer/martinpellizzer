<p>Cabomba australis, commonly known as the Australian waterweed, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged in water, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic environments.
