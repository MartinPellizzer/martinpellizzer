<p>Conophytum frutescens, commonly known as the "Cape Flax" or "Cape Hottentot," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Conophytum frutescens is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
