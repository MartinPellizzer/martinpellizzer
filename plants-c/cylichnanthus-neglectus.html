                <h1>Cylichnanthus neglectus</h1>
<p>Cylichnanthus neglectus, commonly known as the Neglected Cylichnanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cylichnanthus neglectus is considered a rare and under-studied species in botanical research.</p>
