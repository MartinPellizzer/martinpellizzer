<p>Cynorkis spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered female cones and male cones that are separate on the same plant. Native to South Africa, it thrives in warm, dry climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
