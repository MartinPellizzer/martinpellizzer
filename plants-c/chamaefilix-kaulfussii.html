                    <h1>Chamaefilix kaulfussii</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix kaulfussii, commonly known as Kaulfuss's rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
