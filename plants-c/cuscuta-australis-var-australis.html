                    <h1>Cuscuta australis var. australis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta australis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, affecting their growth and health.</p>
