<p>Cyperus erectus, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical flowering spikes that rise from a cluster of grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common wetland plant.</p>
<p>Cyperus erectus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
