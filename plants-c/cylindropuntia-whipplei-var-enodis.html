                    <h1>Cylindropuntia whipplei var. enodis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia whipplei var. enodis, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem that is cylindrical and covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
