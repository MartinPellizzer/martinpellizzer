                    <h1>Cuscuta neuropetala var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta neuropetala var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal areas, where it attaches to a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
