                    <h1>Coryanthes alborosea</h1>
<p>Coryanthes alborosea, commonly known as the white rose coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble white roses, with intricate patterns and a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers emit a faint scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Coryanthes alborosea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
