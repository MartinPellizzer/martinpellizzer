                    <h1>Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. sieberi</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's slender rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to survive in harsh, low-moisture conditions.</p>
