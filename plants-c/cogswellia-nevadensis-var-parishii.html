The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
