<p>Calymmodon grammitidiphyllus, commonly known as the two-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surfaces of the leaves, producing spores for propagation.</p>
