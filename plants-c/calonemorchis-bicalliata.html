<p>Calonemorchis bicalliata, commonly known as the two-spined calonemorchis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-spined labellum, which sets it apart from other orchid species. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces a single, slender stem with few leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
