<p>Chromolaena macrodon, commonly known as the horseweed or chromolaena, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Chromolaena macrodon is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
