                    <h1>Cerastium subspicatum var. apetalum</h1>
<p>Cerastium subspicatum var. apetalum, commonly known as the pink snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are actinomorphic and lack petals, which is reflected in its varietal name "apetalum.".</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
