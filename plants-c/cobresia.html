                    <h1>Cobresia</h1>
<p>Cobresia, commonly known as the "pencil cactus," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. These plants are characterized by their slender, cylindrical stems that resemble pencils, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cobresia species are succulents, storing water in their stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color.</p>
