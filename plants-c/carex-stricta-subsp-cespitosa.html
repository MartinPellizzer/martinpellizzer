<p>Carex stricta subsp.</p>
<p>cespitosa, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It forms dense tussocks with grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
