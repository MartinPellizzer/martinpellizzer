<p>Cactus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cactus, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus brasiliensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
