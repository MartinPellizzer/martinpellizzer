                <h1>Calonemorchis stellata</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, star-like arrangement of leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of mucilage. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the thallus and produce male and female reproductive cells.</p>
<p>Calonemorchis stellata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
