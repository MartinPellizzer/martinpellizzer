                    <h1>Calamagrostis lapponica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or Lapland grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis lapponica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
