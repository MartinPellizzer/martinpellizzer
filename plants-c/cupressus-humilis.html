                    <h1>Cupressus humilis</h1>
<p>Cupressus humilis, commonly known as the low cliff cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form with scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its limited natural range.</p>
