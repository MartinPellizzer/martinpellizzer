                    <h1>Cypripedium × warnhamiense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × warnhamiense, commonly known as the hybrid yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium reginae, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has a distinctive yellow pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination structure, and its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs, often growing on decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
