<p>Callianthe senilis, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble those of the common dandelion. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
