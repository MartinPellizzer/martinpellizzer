<p>Coelogyne guamensis, commonly known as the Guam orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, and often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coelogyne guamensis is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
