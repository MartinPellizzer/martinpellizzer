                    <h1>Chelonistele senagangensis</h1>
<p>Chelonistele senagangensis, commonly known as the Southeast Asian fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
