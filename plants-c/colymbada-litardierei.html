                    <h1>Colymbada litardierei</h1>
<p>Colymbada litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support the weight of the flower and provide buoyancy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
