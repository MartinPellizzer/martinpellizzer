                    <h1>Cryophytum angulatum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum angulatum, commonly known as the angular cryophyte, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate aesthetic to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to minimize water loss in its extreme climate.</p>
<p>Cryophytum angulatum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
