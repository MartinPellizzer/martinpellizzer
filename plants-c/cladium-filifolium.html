<p>Cladium filifolium, commonly known as the slender sawgrass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and shallow waters, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family.</p>
<p>Cladium filifolium plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil.</p>
