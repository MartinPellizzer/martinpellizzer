<p>Chromolaena xestolepis, commonly known as the croton weed, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries.
