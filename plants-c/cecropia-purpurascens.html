                    <h1>Cecropia purpurascens</h1>
<p>Cecropia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf ceiba, is a fast-growing, large tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, especially when young. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a swollen base, which provides structural support for its extensive canopy. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds with silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
