                    <h1>Corylus rostrata var. mitis</h1>
<p>Corylus rostrata var. mitis, commonly known as the soft-shelled hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate nuts with a softer shell compared to the typical hazelnut. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination, and its leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible nuts and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and wildlife value.</p>
