                    <h1>Cremanium rivoeriae</h1>
<p>Cremanium rivoeriae, commonly known as the RÃ­o de la Plata ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the humid subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as riverbanks and forest understories. Its hard, heavy wood has historically been used for construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
