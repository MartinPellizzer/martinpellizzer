                    <h1>Camaridium cyrtopodanthum</h1>
<p>Camaridium cyrtopodanthum, commonly known as the silverleaf coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its dependence on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
