                            <h1>Corybas Pictus</h1>
<p>Pictus orchid, scientifically known as Corybas pictus, is a rare and exquisite member of the orchid family native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia. With its striking dark green leaves and vivid, intricate flowers, it captivates botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. This unique orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its name derives from the detailed, almost pictorial patterns on its petals, which resemble intricate illustrations. Despite its beauty, the Pictus orchid remains a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
