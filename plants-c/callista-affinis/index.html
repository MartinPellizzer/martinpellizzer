                            <h1>Callista Affinis</h1>
<p>Callista affinis is a unique and lesser-known flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental species. This plant is distinguished by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from bright red to deep purple. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements. Its ecological importance and potential medicinal value make it a subject of growing interest among botanists and conservationists.</p>
