                    <h1>Cheilanthes dura</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes dura, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. The plant has a rosette-like structure with tightly clustered, leathery fronds that help reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes dura is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
