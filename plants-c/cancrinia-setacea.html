                    <h1>Cancrinia setacea</h1>
<p>Cancrinia setacea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in fine, hair-like structures called setae. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
