                    <h1>Cryophytum neilsoniae</h1>
<p>Cryophytum neilsoniae, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to extreme cold and low light conditions.</p>
<p>Cryophytum neilsoniae plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the sparse vegetation of Antarctic ecosystems.</p>
