<p>Carex vesicaria var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir sedge, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
