<p>Chondrorhyncha cornuta, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern and may bear small, horn-like projections, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Chondrorhyncha cornuta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
