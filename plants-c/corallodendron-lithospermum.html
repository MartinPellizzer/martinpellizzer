<p>Corallodendron lithospermum, commonly known as the stone root or rock plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are thick and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Corallodendron lithospermum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
