<p>Conopodium californicum, commonly known as the California burrseed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of small white to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conopodium californicum is an important component of local flora, contributing to biodiversity in its native range.</p>
