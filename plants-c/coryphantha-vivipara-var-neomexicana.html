                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. neomexicana</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico live-bearing cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is known for its viviparous reproduction, where offspring are produced directly on the stems rather than through seeds.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it well-suited for survival in harsh, desert conditions.</p>
