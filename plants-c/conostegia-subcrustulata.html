                    <h1>Conostegia subcrustulata</h1>
<p>Conostegia subcrustulata, commonly known as the crusty conostegia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Conostegia subcrustulata is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
