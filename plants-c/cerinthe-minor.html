                    <h1>Cerinthe minor</h1>
<p>Cerinthe minor, commonly known as lesser cerinthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Cerinthe minor prefers sunny to partially shaded locations and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
