                    <h1>Cremanium reclinatum</h1>
<p>Cremanium reclinatum, commonly known as the hanging rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
