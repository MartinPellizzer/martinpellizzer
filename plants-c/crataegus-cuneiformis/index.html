                            <h1>Crataegus Cuneiformis</h1>
<p>Crataegus cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to parts of eastern North America. This plant is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for various wildlife species. The narrow-leaf hawthorn is often found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
