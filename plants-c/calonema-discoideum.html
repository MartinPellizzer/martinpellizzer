                    <h1>Calonema discoideum</h1>
<p>Calonema discoideum, commonly known as the star-shaped flatweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Calonema discoideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its morphology and ecological role.</p>
