                    <h1>Cyclosorus dulitensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus dulitensis, commonly known as the Dullit Islands water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in shaded, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus dulitensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
