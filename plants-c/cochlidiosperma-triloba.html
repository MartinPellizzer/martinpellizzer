                    <h1>Cochlidiosperma triloba</h1>
<p>Cochlidiosperma triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed glassywood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its woody structure and thick, fleshy leaves help it conserve water in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cochlidiosperma triloba is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
