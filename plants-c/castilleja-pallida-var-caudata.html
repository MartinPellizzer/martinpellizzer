                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. caudata</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. caudata, commonly known as the pale castilleja with a tail, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-red flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often found in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
