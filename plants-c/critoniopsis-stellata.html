                    <h1>Critoniopsis stellata</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis stellata, commonly known as the star-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Critoniopsis stellata is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
