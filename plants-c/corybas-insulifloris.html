<p>Corybas insulifloris, commonly known as the island flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>This terrestrial orchid features a unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a flame, with vivid red and orange hues. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that is often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its island home.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, Corybas insulifloris is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
