                    <h1>Calophyllum trachycaule</h1>
<p>Calophyllum trachycaule, commonly known as the rough-stemmed candlewood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its thick, ridged, and often rough-textured bark. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
