                    <h1>Chondropetalum macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Chondropetalum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in whorls of fertile and sterile branches. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
