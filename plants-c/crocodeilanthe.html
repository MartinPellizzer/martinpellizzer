<p>Crocodeilanthe, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble a dragon's tail. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Crocodeilanthe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or as a houseplant.</p>
