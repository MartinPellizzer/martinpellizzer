This plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It typically blooms in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
