                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa f. sterilis</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile broad-fruit water-starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family and typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are often reduced or absent in this particular form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of pristine aquatic ecosystems.</p>
