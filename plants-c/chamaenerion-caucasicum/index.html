                            <h1>Chamaenerion Caucasicum</h1>
<p>Caucasian fireweed, scientifically known as Chamaenerion caucasicum, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, reddish-purple stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. This species thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found along riverbanks and in alpine meadows. Its common name reflects its fiery appearance and its ability to regenerate after wildfires. Despite its beauty, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
