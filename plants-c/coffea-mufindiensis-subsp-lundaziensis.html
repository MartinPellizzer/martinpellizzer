                    <h1>Coffea mufindiensis subsp. lundaziensis</h1>
<p>Coffea mufindiensis subsp.</p>
<p>lundaziensis, commonly known as Lundazi coffee, is a lesser-known wild coffee species native to the Eastern African region, particularly in Tanzania and Malawi. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped red berries that contain two seeds, typical of the Coffea genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical highland climates with well-drained soils and requires a humid environment with partial shade. Its botanical features include dark green, glossy leaves and a compact shrub growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially valuable species for coffee biodiversity.</p>
