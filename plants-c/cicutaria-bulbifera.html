                    <h1>Cicutaria bulbifera</h1>
<p>Cicutaria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulb-like structures at the base of its stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Cicutaria bulbifera is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress.</p>
