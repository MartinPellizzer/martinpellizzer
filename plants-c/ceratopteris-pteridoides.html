<p>Ceratopteris pteridoides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
