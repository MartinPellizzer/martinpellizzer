<p>Cosentinia vellea nothosubsp.</p>
<p>rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Rivas-Martinez variant of the common cosentinia, is a hybrid plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
