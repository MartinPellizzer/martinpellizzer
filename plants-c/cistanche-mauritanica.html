                    <h1>Cistanche mauritanica</h1>
<p>Cistanche mauritanica, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through its specialized haustoria. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a fleshy, branching stem. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems.</p>
