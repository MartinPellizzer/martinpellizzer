<p>Cerastium alpicola, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its growth habit is mat-forming, allowing it to spread and stabilize soil in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Cerastium alpicola plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to vegetation cover.</p>
