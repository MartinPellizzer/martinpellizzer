                    <h1>Cassia adamantina</h1>
<p>Cassia adamantina, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feathery leaflets, and the plant produces long, woody pods that contain flat, seed-filled pods. Cassia adamantina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both visually appealing and ecologically valuable in its native habitats.</p>
