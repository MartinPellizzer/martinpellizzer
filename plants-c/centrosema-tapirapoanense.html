<p>Centrosema tapirapoanense, commonly known as the Tapirapoan centrosema, is a species of legume native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and potential for use in ecological restoration projects have also been noted.</p>
