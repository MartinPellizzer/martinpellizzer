                    <h1>Cactus odierianus</h1>
<p>Cactus odierianus, commonly known as the Odiern's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is often ribbed and covered in spines for protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
