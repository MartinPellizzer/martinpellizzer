<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow stripe. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating vibrant displays in the wild or cultivated settings.</p>
