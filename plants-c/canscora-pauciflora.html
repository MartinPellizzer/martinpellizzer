<p>Canscora pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
