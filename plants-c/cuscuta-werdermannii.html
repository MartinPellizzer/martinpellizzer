                    <h1>Cuscuta werdermannii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta werdermannii, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to the western United States and thrives in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or kill its host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings.</p>
