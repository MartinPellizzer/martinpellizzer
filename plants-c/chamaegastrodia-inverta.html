                    <h1>Chamaegastrodia inverta</h1>
<p>Chamaegastrodia inverta, commonly known as the inverted stomach orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and faces threats from habitat destruction and overcollection.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid evolution and ecological adaptation in high-altitude environments.</p>
