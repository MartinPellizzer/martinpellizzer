<p>Cyperus tenax subsp.</p>
<p>tenax, commonly known as hardy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland conditions.</p>
