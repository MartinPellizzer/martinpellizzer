                    <h1>Callitris propinqua</h1>
<p>Callitris propinqua, commonly known as the stinking cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically arranged in crossed pairs, and the bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
