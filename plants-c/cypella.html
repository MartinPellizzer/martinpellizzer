                    <h1>Cypella</h1>
<p>Cypella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Cypella species are typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in saline and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
