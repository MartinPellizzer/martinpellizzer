<p>Cissus umbrosa, commonly known as the creeping grape ivy, is a vigorous trailing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and silver. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cissus umbrosa is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb or trail from shelves and hanging baskets.</p>
