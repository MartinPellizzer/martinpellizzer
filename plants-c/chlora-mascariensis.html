                    <h1>Chlora mascariensis</h1>
<p>Chlora mascariensis, commonly known as the Mascarene chlorophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered greenish-white flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
