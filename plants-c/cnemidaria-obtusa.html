<p>Cnemidaria obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically broad and oval-shaped, often arranged in a rosette formation on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, allowing it to stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
