                            <h1>Calycobolus Velutinus</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Calycobolus velutinus, is a highly invasive weed native to the Americas but now found in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. This plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in a soft, velvety texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly dominate agricultural fields and natural ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it poses a significant threat to biodiversity and crop production. Efforts to control its spread often involve mechanical removal, herbicides, and biological control methods.</p>
