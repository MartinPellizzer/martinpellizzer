<p>Carludovica nobilis, commonly known as the sacred cactus or the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, light green stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Carludovica nobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
