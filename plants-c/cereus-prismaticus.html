<p>Cereus prismaticus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and red, often appearing at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
