                            <h1>Consolida Raveyi</h1>
<p>Consolida raveyi is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is known for its vibrant, spurred petals that resemble tiny trumpets, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. This species belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. Its delicate flowers bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Consolida raveyi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
