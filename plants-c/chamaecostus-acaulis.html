<p>Chamaecostus acaulis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
