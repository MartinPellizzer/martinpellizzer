<p>Caraipa jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's caraipa, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its leaves are usually ovate with a velvety texture, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Caraipa jaramilloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
