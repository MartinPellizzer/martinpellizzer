<p>Carex × naegelii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgewort, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
