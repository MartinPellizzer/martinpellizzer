                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus proles triflorum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus proles triflorum, commonly known as the trifloral杓兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
