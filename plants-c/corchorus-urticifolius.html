                    <h1>Corchorus urticifolius</h1>
<p>Corchorus urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that contain irritant chemicals, such as histamine and acetylcholine, which cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers arranged in spikes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes other plants with similar defensive mechanisms.</p>
