<p>Cariniana pauciramosa, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or *pinh√£o-do-brejo*, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in secondary forests and riparian zones.</p>
