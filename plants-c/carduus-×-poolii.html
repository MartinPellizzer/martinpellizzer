<p>Carduus × poolii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carduus nutans (goat’s beard) and Carduus tectorum (common thistle). The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
