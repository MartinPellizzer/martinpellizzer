<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.

<p>Craspedaria lagopodioides is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
