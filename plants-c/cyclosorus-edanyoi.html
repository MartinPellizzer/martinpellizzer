<p>Cyclosorus edanyoi, commonly known as the Edanyo's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cyclosorus. It thrives in freshwater habitats with soft, muddy substrates and requires moderate to low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
