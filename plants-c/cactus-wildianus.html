                    <h1>Cactus wildianus</h1>
<p>Cactus wildianus, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming at night to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus wildianus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
