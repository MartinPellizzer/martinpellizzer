                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa f. fluctuans</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa f. fluctuans, commonly known as floating water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its roots. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are usually oval or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediment and improve water quality.</p>
