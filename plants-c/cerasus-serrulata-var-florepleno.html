<p>Cerasus serrulata var. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry or Japanese doubleflowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, double blooms of white or pink petals that appear in early spring, giving it a particularly ornamental appearance. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, red drupes that ripen in late summer, though these are not typically harvested for consumption.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its showy flowers and is often used in ornamental gardens and as a specimen plant.</p>
