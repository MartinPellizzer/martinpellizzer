                    <h1>Crataegus altrix</h1>
<p>Crataegus altrix, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries in late summer. Crataegus altrix is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant's thorns make it a defensive species.</p>
