                    <h1>Crotalaria grandistipulata</h1>
<p>Crotalaria grandistipulata, commonly known as the large-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the ground.</p>
<p>Crotalaria grandistipulata is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
