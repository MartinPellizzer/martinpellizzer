<p>Cuscuta kilimanjari var. rukararana, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex system of haustoria to extract water and nutrients from its host. It is an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the local flora and fauna interactions.</p>
