<p>Cladium mariscus subsp.</p>
<p>intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense tussocks, typically growing in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, spathate fruits. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor environments.</p>
