                    <h1>Cylindropuntia versicolor</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its adaptations include a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and the ability to store water in its succulent stems.</p>
<p>The rainbow cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance.</p>
