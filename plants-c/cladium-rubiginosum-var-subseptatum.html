                    <h1>Cladium rubiginosum var. subseptatum</h1>
<p>Cladium rubiginosum var. subseptatum, commonly known as the red-stained sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like blades that are often reddish in color, particularly along the midribs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in freshwater marshes and is adapted to periodically flooded conditions. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a fibrous structure that aids in buoyancy and water retention.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
