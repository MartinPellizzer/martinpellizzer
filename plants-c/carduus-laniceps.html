<p>Carduus laniceps, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves, as well as its large, purple-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
