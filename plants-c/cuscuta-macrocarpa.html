                    <h1>Cuscuta macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta macrocarpa, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often smothering its host. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including fields and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
