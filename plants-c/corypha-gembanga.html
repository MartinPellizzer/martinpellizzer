                    <h1>Corypha gembanga</h1>
<p>Corypha gembanga, commonly known as the Bornean palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Corypha gembanga is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
