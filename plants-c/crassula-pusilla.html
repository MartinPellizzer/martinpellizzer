                    <h1>Crassula pusilla</h1>
<p>Crassula pusilla, commonly known as the baby blue plant, is a compact, succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
