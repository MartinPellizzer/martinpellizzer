                            <h1>Cornus Instolonea</h1>
<p>Red osier dogwood, scientifically known as Cornus instolonea, is a striking shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. Its most notable feature is the bright red stems that stand out against the green foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. It produces clusters of small white flowers in the spring, followed by vibrant red berries in the fall. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that the plant is toxic to humans and livestock if ingested.</p>
