                    <h1>Calea robusta</h1>
<p>Calea robusta, commonly known as the "flower of the night," is a striking plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that open at night and close in the morning. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its unique nocturnal blooming pattern is triggered by changes in light and temperature.</p>
<p>Calea robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
