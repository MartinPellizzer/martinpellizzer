                    <h1>Clidemia platyphylla</h1>
<p>Clidemia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, such as mahogany and ceiba, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered at the base of its leaves. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with fine, short hairs.</p>
<p>Clidemia platyphylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
