                    <h1>Cyclosorus pendens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus pendens, commonly known as the hanging liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that often hang from the substrate. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is typically found on rocks, tree trunks, or damp soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pendens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
