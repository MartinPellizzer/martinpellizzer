<p>Carex intermedia var. repens, commonly known as the creeping sedges, is a perennial sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. It has rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
