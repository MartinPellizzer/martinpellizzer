                    <h1>Chalarothyrsus</h1>
<p>Chalarothyrsus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pods that contain seeds. Chalarothyrsus species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for carving and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now considered threatened or endangered.</p>
