<p>Cleome dodecandra, commonly known as the "spider flower," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spindly stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Cleome dodecandra is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
