                    <h1>Cyperus dehiscens</h1>
<p>Cyperus dehiscens, commonly known as the spreading flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae).</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Cyperus dehiscens is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can thrive in both submerged and emergent habitats.</p>
