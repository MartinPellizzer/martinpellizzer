<p>Canavalia arenicola, commonly known as the beach bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, saline environments, making it well adapted to beach and dune ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria helps enrich the soil in nutrient-poor areas.</p>
<p>Canavalia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
