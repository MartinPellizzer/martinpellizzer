                    <h1>Capraria crustacea</h1>
<p>Capraria crustacea, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, while its compact growth form allows it to withstand strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Capraria crustacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
