<p>Corallodiscus cordatulus, commonly known as the heart-shaped diatom, is a unicellular aquatic organism belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, known as a frustule, which exhibits a distinctive heart-shaped morphology. The species is typically found in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it contributes to the biological silica cycle. Its frustule is composed of two overlapping halves, with a central area that is slightly concave, giving it its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Corallodiscus cordatulus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
