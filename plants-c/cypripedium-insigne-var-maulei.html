                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. maulei</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. maulei, commonly known as the Maule's lady's slipper, is a rare orchid native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a deep pink to purple hue and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, elegant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
