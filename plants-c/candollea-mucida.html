                    <h1>Candollea mucida</h1>
<p>Candollea mucida, commonly known as the sticky leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>Candollea mucida is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
