<p>Cuscuta kotschyana subsp.</p>
<p>caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender, branching stems.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it commonly parasitizes a variety of host species, including grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of host plants and then developing specialized structures to attach to and extract nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered an annual plant with a short growing season.</p>
