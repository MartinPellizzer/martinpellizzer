                    <h1>Cuscuta gronovii var. vulgivaga</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gronovii var. vulgivaga, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hooked tendrils that help it attach to its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can be found on a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
