<p>Chevaliera grandiceps, commonly known as the giant rock melon, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically green and succulent, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chevaliera grandiceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
