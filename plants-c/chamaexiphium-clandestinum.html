                    <h1>Chamaexiphium clandestinum</h1>
<p>Chamaexiphium clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden phyllium, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
