                    <h1>Coelandria fornicata</h1>
<p>Coelandria fornicata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Coelandria fornicata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
