<p>Coryphantha pallida subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoradians, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant produces pale green to blue-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
