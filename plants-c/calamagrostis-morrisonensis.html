<p>Calamagrostis morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's reed, is a grass species native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland habitats. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
