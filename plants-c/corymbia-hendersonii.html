                    <h1>Corymbia hendersonii</h1>
<p>Corymbia hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that often peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The wood of Corymbia hendersonii is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and construction.</p>
