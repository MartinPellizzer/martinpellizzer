<p>Crepis flexiscapa, commonly known as the bent bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage with slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common indicator plant in wetland habitats.</p>
