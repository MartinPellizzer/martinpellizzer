<p>Castilleja martini var. martini, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called phyllodes, which are used for photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and shrubs, to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Castilleja martini var. martini thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems.</p>
