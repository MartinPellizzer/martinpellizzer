                    <h1>Ctenopteris congregatifolia</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris congregatifolia, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a clustered formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
