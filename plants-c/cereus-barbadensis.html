                    <h1>Cereus barbadensis</h1>
<p>Cereus barbadensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
<p>Its unique flowering behavior and striking appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
