<p>Chesneya polystichoides subsp.</p>
<p>bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of a fern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
