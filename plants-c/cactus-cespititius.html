                    <h1>Cactus cespititius</h1>
<p>Cactus cespititius, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, low-growing cluster. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers, typically yellow or white, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>
