                    <h1>Cycas laotica</h1>
<p>Cycas laotica, commonly known as the Laotian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas laotica is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
