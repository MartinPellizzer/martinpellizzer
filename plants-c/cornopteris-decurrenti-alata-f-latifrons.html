<p>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded cliff brake, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology.</p>
<p>It features elongated, bipinnate fronds with a decurrent base that extends down the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The fronds are typically broad and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories where it can access adequate moisture.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
