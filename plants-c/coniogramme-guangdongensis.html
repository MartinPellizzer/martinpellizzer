                    <h1>Coniogramme guangdongensis</h1>
<p>Coniogramme guangdongensis, commonly known as the Guangdong coniogramme, is a rare and endemic fern species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
