                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
