<p>Cheilanthes ciliata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and small, lance-shaped fronds with finely toothed margins. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It typically grows on rocky slopes or in crevices, where it can anchor itself firmly.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes ciliata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
