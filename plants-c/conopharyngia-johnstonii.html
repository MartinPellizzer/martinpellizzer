The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with the fruiting bodies producing spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
