                    <h1>Cycas villosa</h1>
<p>Cycas villosa, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Cycas villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
