<p>Coussapoa cardonae, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is a spineless, columnar cactus that can grow up to three meters tall, with a distinctive appearance due to its thick, fleshy stems. The plant features a crown of branched, leaf-like structures that are adapted for photosynthesis, as it lacks true leaves. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically yellow or orange, blooming during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Coussapoa cardonae is well adapted to the arid climate of Socotra, storing water in its stems and surviving with minimal rainfall.</p>
