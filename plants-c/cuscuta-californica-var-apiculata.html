                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. apiculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. apiculata, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species.</p>
