                    <h1>Cynodon curtipendulus</h1>
<p>Cynodon curtipendulus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive lawns or turf.</p>
<p>Cynodon curtipendulus is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
