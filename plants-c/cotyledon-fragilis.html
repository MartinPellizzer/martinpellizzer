<p>Cotyledon fragilis, commonly known as the fragile cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its leaves are delicate and prone to breaking, which is why it is sometimes called the "breakheart" plant.</p>
<p>Cotyledon fragilis is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
