                    <h1>Cuscuta sulcata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta sulcata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Cuscuta sulcata can significantly reduce crop yields by draining resources from its host plants.</p>
