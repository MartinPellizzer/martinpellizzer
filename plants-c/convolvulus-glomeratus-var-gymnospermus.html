                    <h1>Convolvulus glomeratus var. gymnospermus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus glomeratus var. gymnospermus, commonly known as the gymnospermous bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that produce small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique seed structure, which resembles that of gymnosperms, though it is still classified as an angiosperm.</p>
