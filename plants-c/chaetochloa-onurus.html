<p>Chaetochloa onurus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by three-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
