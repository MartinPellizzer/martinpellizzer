                    <h1>Caralluma gracilipes</h1>
<p>Caralluma gracilipes, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, water-storing stems and ability to photosynthesize at night. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, minimizing water loss, while its flowers are typically white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Caralluma gracilipes is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional remedies for various ailments.</p>
