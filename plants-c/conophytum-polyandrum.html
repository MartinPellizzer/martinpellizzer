<p>Conophytum polyandrum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Conophytum polyandrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments.</p>
