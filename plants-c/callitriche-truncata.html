                    <h1>Callitriche truncata</h1>
<p>Callitriche truncata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, often in still or slow-moving streams, ponds, and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom from June to September. It is characterized by its ability to float or root in muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Callitriche truncata is also used in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
