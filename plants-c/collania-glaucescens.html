                    <h1>Collania glaucescens</h1>
<p>Collania glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are usually covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
