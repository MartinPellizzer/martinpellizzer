                    <h1>Cullen stipulaceum</h1>
<p>Cullen stipulaceum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
