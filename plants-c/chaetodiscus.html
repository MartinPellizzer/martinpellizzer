                    <h1>Chaetodiscus</h1>
<p>Chaetodiscus, commonly known as the "star-shaped diatom," is a genus of unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>These microscopic organisms are characterized by their intricate silica cell walls, which form complex, symmetrical patterns often resembling stars or other geometric shapes. Chaetodiscus species are typically found in freshwater environments, such as lakes and rivers, where they thrive in nutrient-rich waters. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, they are also used as indicators of water quality and ecological health.</p>
