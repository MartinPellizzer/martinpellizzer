                    <h1>Carduus candidissimus</h1>
<p>Carduus candidissimus, commonly known as the white cock's-comb, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and a large, spherical inflorescence composed of white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
