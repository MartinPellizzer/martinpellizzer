                            <h1>Celtis Brevifolia</h1>
<p>Celtis brevifolia, commonly known as the Mexican hackberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. This hardy plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, rocky areas. Its fruit, which is edible for some animals, plays a role in local ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Celtis brevifolia is an important species for both wildlife and human use.</p>
