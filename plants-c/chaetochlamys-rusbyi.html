<p>Chaetochlamys rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a short, upright stem and a single, showy flower with intricate, thread-like petals. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Chaetochlamys rusbyi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
