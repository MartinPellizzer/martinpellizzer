<p>Carex zunyiensis, commonly known as the Zunyi sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically reaches a height of about 30 to 50 centimeters and has a rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carex zunyiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
