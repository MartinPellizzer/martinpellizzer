<p>Cereus anguinus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours.</p>
<p>Cereus anguinus is well adapted to desert conditions, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
