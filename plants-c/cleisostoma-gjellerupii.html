                    <h1>Cleisostoma gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Cleisostoma gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's cleistostoma, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying orchid diversity and adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, the conservation status of this species remains uncertain.</p>
