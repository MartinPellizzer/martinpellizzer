                    <h1>Carex intermedia var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Carex intermedia var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually shorter than those of the typical Carex intermedia. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often surrounded by short bracts.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
