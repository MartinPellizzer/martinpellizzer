<p>Clermontia parviflora var. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered clermonthe, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high elevations. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
