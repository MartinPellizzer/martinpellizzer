                    <h1>Cyperus pumilus f. membranaceus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pumilus f. membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a compact perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a distinctive membranous sheath at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
