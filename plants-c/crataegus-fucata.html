                    <h1>Crataegus fucata</h1>
<p>Crataegus fucata, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue to black berries in late summer. Crataegus fucata is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible but have a high tannin content, making them more suitable for processing into jams or wines.</p>
