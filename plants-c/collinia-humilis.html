                    <h1>Collinia humilis</h1>
<p>Collinia humilis, commonly known as the low collinia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collinia humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
