                    <h1>Cynanchum alatum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum alatum, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with distinct wing-like structures along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cynanchum alatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions.</p>
