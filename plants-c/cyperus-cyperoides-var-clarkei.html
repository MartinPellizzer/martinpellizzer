                    <h1>Cyperus cyperoides var. clarkei</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyperoides var. clarkei, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
