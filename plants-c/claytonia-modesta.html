                    <h1>Claytonia modesta</h1>
<p>Claytonia modesta, commonly known as the common spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves fully unfurl. Its leaves are often covered with a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Claytonia modesta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
