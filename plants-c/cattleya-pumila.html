                    <h1>Cattleya pumila</h1>
<p>Cattleya pumila, commonly known as the miniature cattleya, is a small orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Despite its small stature, Cattleya pumila is prized for its beauty and ease of care.</p>
