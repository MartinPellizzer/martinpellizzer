<p>Cerastium vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>fontanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude conditions make it a characteristic species of alpine flora.</p>
