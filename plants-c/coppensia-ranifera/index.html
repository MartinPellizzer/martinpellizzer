                            <h1>Coppensia Ranifera</h1>
<p>Coppensia ranifera is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is known for its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
