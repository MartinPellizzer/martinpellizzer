                    <h1>Crocus gargaricus</h1>
<p>Crocus gargaricus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in the autumn. The plant produces a corm, a swollen underground stem that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its most notable feature is the stamen, which contains the vivid orange or red style and stigma, used in the production of saffron.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its historical association with the saffron spice, derived from the stigmas of its flowers.</p>
