                    <h1>Cistanche</h1>
<p>Cistanche, commonly known as the Indian rhatibar or desert tubers, is a genus of parasitic plants belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>These plants lack chlorophyll and rely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various shrubs and trees. Cistanche species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, India, and the Middle East. They are characterized by their yellow or orange tubular structures that resemble flowers, though they do not produce true flowers.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Cistanche tubulosa, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
