<p>Coalisina niamniamensis, commonly known as the Cameroon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of its habitat. Its leaves are elliptical and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>
