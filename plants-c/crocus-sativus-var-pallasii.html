<p>It produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant's most notable feature is its staminodes, which are often mistaken for stamens and are used in traditional saffron harvesting. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common saffron crocus, Crocus sativus, and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance.</p>
