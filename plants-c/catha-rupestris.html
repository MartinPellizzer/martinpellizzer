                <h1>Catha rupestris</h1>
<p>Catha rupestris, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its leaves contain cathinone and cathine, alkaloids that have stimulant properties.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive effects, it is sometimes cultivated and used in traditional contexts, though it is also regulated in many regions.</p>
