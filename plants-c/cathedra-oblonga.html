<p>Cathedra oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It has a compact growth habit, often forming a dense mat or low shrub.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to poor soils and drought makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
