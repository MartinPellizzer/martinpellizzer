                    <h1>Carex bifida</h1>
<p>Carex bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically split or divided near the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, pond margins, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex bifida is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
