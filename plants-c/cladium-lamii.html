                    <h1>Cladium lamii</h1>
<p>Cladium lamii, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cladium lamii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>
