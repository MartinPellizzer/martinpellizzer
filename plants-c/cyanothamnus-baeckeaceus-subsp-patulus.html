<p>Cyanothamnus baeckeaceus subsp.</p>
<p>patulus, commonly known as the coastal bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to spring.</p>
<p>The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
