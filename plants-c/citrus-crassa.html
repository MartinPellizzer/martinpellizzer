                    <h1>Citrus crassa</h1>
<p>Citrus crassa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a species of citrus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often pebbled rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus fruits. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically sour and not commonly consumed by humans. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other citrus plants due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen, broad, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
