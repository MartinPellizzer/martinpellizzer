<p>Cyclosorus parvilobus, commonly known as the small-lobed cyclosorus, is a member of the family Marsileaceae, commonly referred to as water clovers.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic plant characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly lobed. This species typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the reproductive structures, including small flowers, emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus parvilobus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
