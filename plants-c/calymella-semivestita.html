                    <h1>Calymella semivestita</h1>
<p>Calymella semivestita, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calymella semivestita is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
