                    <h1>Cyperus polystachyos var. cleaveri</h1>
<p>Cyperus polystachyos var. cleaveri, commonly known as cleavers, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Cleavers are known for their ability to adhere to clothing and animal fur, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
