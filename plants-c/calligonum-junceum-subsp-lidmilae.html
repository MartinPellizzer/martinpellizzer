<p>Calligonum junceum subsp.</p>
<p>lidmilae, commonly known as the desert rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
