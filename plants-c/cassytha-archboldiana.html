                    <h1>Cassytha archboldiana</h1>
<p>Cassytha archboldiana, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a parasitic vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It attaches itself to host trees using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
