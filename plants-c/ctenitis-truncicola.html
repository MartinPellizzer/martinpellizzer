<p>Ctenitis truncicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Ctenitis truncicola is well adapted to coastal and humid climates, where it thrives in the presence of high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
