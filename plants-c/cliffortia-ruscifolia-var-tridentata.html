<p>Cliffortia ruscifolia var. tridentata, commonly known as the Tridentate Cliffortia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the variety 'tridentata' is distinguished by its three-lobed leaf tips.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
