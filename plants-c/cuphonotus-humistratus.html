<p>Cuphonotus humistratus, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pale blue to white and attract a variety of pollinators.</p>
