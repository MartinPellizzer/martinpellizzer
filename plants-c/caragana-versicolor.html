<p>Caragana versicolor, commonly known as the variable peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana versicolor is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
