                            <h1>Chrysanthemum Darwasicum</h1>
<p>Darwin's chrysanthemum, scientifically known as Chrysanthemum darwasicum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. This unique species was first discovered in the early 20th century and named in honor of the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange blooms and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. Despite its beauty, the plant remains poorly understood due to its limited distribution and elusive nature. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
