                    <h1>Chesneya</h1>
<p>Chesneya, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Chesneya species are typically perennial, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling them to thrive in dry environments. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
