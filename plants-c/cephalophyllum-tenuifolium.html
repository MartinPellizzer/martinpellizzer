                    <h1>Cephalophyllum tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved headplant, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, spiny stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
