<p>Cassebeera ternifolia var. ornithopus, commonly known as the ornate cassava, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its stems and leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its edible roots, which are similar in texture to cassava but have a milder flavor.</p>
