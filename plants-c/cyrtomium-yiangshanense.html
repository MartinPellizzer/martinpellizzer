                    <h1>Cyrtomium yiangshanense</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium yiangshanense, commonly known as the Yiangshan holly fern, is a rare evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
