                            <h1>Cocculus Crispus</h1>
<p>Cocculus, scientifically known as Cocculus crispus, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive waxy, spiny fruit and compound leaves. Often found in moist woodlands and stream sides, this plant has a long history of traditional use in herbal medicine. Its unique appearance and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest for botanists and herbalists alike. Despite its ornamental value, Cocculus remains relatively understudied in modern scientific research.</p>
