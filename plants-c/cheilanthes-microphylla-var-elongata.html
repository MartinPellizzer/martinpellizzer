                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. elongata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. elongata, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize exposed rock surfaces.</p>
