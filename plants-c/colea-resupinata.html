                    <h1>Colea resupinata</h1>
<p>Colea resupinata, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers during the late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Colea resupinata is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
