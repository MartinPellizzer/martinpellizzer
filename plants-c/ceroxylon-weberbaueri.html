<p>Ceroxylon weberbaueri, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that are highly visible and attract various pollinators. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions.</p>
