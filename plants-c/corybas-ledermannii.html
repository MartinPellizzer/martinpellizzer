                    <h1>Corybas ledermannii</h1>
<p>Corybas ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's hooded orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that protects the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct hood, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
