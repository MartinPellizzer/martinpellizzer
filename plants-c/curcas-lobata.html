<p>Curcas lobata, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Curcas lobata also has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
