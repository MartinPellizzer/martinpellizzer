                    <h1>Cenchrus aequiglumis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus aequiglumis, commonly known as the common wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
