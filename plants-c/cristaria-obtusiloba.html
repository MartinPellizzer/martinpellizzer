                    <h1>Cristaria obtusiloba</h1>
<p>Cristaria obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a challenge for agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant biology.</p>
