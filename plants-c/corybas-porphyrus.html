                    <h1>Corybas porphyrus</h1>
<p>Corybas porphyrus, commonly known as the red torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant produces a single, striking red or orange flower that resembles a torch, which is highly attractive to pollinators. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies, which are drawn to the strong, musky scent.</p>
<p>The plant has a short-lived vegetative phase and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence.</p>
