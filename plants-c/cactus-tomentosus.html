                    <h1>Cactus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Cactus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy exterior. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly during rare rainfall events.</p>
<p>Cactus tomentosus is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
