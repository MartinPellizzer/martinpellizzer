                    <h1>Calligonum alatosetosum</h1>
<p>Calligonum alatosetosum, commonly known as the hairy goat's beard, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calligonum alatosetosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
