<p>Cardamine latifolia var. calabrica, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
