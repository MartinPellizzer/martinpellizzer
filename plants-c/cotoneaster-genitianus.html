                    <h1>Cotoneaster genitianus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster genitianus, commonly known as the Alpine cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster genitianus is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates.</p>
