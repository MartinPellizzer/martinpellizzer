<p>Castilleja eremophila, commonly known as the desert paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Castilleja eremophila typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
