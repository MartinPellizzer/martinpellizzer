                    <h1>Cypripedium × marmorophyllum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × marmorophyllum, commonly known as the marbled lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species characterized by its distinctive marbled patterns on its petals and sepals.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
