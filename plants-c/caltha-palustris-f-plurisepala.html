<p>Caltha palustris f. plurisepala, commonly known as the many-sepaled marsh marigold, is a botanical variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its elongated, showy sepals that are often longer than the petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, stream banks, and marshes.</p>
<p>The foliage consists of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are also attractive in their own right.</p>
