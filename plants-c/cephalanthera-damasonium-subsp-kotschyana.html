<p>Cephalanthera damasonium subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyan's early gentian, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a tuberous root system and thrives in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and a slender, erect stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
