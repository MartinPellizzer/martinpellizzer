                    <h1>Cerium</h1>
<p>Cerium, commonly known as a rare earth element, is not a plant but a metallic element found in the lanthanide series of the periodic table.</p>
<p>It is primarily extracted from minerals such as monazite and bastn√§site, which are found in certain types of sand and rock formations. While cerium itself does not have botanical applications, it is used in various industrial and technological processes that indirectly support plant growth through agricultural technologies. Its chemical properties make it valuable in catalytic converters and fluorescent lighting, which can influence environmental conditions for plant cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its metallic nature, cerium does not exhibit the characteristics of a botanical organism.</p>
