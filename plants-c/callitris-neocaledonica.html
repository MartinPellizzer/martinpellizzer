                    <h1>Callitris neocaledonica</h1>
<p>Callitris neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, and its cones are typically woody and globose. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of New Caledonia's endemic flora.</p>
