                    <h1>Chasmone cuneifolia var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Chasmone cuneifolia var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-leaved chasmone, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrowly lance-shaped leaves that are shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
