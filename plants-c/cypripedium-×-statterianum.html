<p>Cypripedium × statterianum, commonly known as the Statter's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
