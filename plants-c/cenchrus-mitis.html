                    <h1>Cenchrus mitis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus mitis, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in disturbed soils.</p>
