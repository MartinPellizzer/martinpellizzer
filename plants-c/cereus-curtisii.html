<p>Cereus curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent gardens.</p>
