<p>Coppensia edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmond's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pale green and white flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a small, terrestrial herb with a single, slender stem and a few leaves. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as the broad-tailed honeyeater.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia edmundoi is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
