                    <h1>Chrysothemis aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Chrysothemis aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden flame cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers that bloom in the late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Chrysothemis aurantiaca is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
