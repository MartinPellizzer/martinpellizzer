<p>Cheiranthus forrestii var. acaulis, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
