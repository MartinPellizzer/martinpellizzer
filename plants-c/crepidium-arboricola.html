<p>Crepidium arboricola, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tree-like growth habit, with a single stem that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
