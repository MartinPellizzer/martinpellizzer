<p>Coursetia diversifolia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, featuring a waxy cuticle and a narrow shape.</p>
<p>Coursetia diversifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert environments.</p>
