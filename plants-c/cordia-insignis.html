                    <h1>Cordia insignis</h1>
<p>Cordia insignis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody structure and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cordia insignis plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
