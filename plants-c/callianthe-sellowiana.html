                    <h1>Callianthe sellowiana</h1>
<p>Callianthe sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually a vibrant yellow or orange, attracting specific pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
