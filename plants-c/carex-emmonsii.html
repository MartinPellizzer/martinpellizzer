<p>Carex emmonsii, commonly known as Emmons' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in open meadows or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Emmons' sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
