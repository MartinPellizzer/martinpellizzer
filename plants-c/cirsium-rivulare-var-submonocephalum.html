                    <h1>Cirsium rivulare var. submonocephalum</h1>
<p>Cirsium rivulare var. submonocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and stream sides. The plant features a tall, spiny stem with alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are purple to pink, forming dense spherical heads, and it produces small, ribbed achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
