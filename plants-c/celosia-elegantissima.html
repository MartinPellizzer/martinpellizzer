<p>Celosia elegantissima, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in warm, sunny conditions and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked in favor of the showy foliage.</p>
<p>Celosia elegantissima is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, adding to its resilience and adaptability.</p>
