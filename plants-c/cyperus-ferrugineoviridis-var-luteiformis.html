                    <h1>Cyperus ferrugineoviridis var. luteiformis</h1>
<p>Cyperus ferrugineoviridis var. luteiformis, commonly known as the golden bulb rush, is a variant of the Cyperus genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive yellowish-brown inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a reddish or bronze hue, adding ornamental value to wetland landscapes.</p>
