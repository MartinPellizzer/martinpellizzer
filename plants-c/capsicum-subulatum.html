                    <h1>Capsicum subulatum</h1>
<p>Capsicum subulatum, commonly known as the slender capsicum or desert pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, yellow or orange fruits that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Capsicum subulatum is closely related to other chili pepper species but is less commonly cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
