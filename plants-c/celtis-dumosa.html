                    <h1>Celtis dumosa</h1>
<p>Celtis dumosa, commonly known as the roughleaf boxleaf, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some wildlife but generally not palatable to humans. Celtis dumosa is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
