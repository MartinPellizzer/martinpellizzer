<p>Carex michelii f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent sedge, is a variant of the broader Carex michelii species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and fibrous root system. The plant features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered with a fine, hairy coating, which gives it the "puberula" designation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and forest understories.</p>
