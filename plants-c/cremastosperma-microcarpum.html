<p>Cremastosperma microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible fruits. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits are adapted for dispersal by wind, a common strategy in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Cremastosperma microcarpum is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local vegetation in its range.</p>
