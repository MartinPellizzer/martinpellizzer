                    <h1>Crassula pustulata</h1>
<p>Crassula pustulata, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Crassula pustulata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
