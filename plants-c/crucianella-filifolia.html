<p>Crucianella filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
