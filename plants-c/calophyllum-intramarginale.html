<p>Calophyllum intramarginale, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is now protected due to overharvesting.</p>
