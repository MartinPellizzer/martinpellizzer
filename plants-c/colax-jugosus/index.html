                            <h1>Colax Jugosus</h1>
<p>Java tea, scientifically known as Colax jugosus, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This flowering shrub is often mistaken for a true tea due to its caffeine content and traditional use in herbal infusions. Despite its name, it is not related to the Camellia genus that produces true tea leaves. Its leaves are commonly used to make a refreshing beverage, often consumed for its mild stimulant properties. Java tea has gained popularity in modern wellness circles for its purported health benefits and distinct flavor profile.</p>
