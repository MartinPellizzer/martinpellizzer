                    <h1>Calligonum quadripterum</h1>
<p>Calligonum quadripterum, commonly known as the four-winged tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive four-winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deep underground, contributing to its resilience.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
