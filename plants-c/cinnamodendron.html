                    <h1>Cinnamodendron</h1>
<p>Cinnamodendron, commonly known as the cinnamon tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. They are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The bark and leaves of Cinnamodendron species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction.</p>
