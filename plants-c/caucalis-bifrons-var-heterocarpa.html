<p>Caucalis bifrons var. heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its unique feature is the presence of heterocarpic fruits, which are one-seeded, dry fruits that differ in structure from the typical capsules.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptability.</p>
