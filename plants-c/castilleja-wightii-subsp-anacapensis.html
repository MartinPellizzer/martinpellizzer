<p>Castilleja wightii subsp.</p>
<p>anacapensis, commonly known as the Anacapensis paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to coastal areas of southern California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, leafless stems that often grow in clusters, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
