<p>Cyperus filicinus f. cleaveri, commonly known as the Cleaver's flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus characterized by its distinctive morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in regions with high humidity and saturated soils, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
