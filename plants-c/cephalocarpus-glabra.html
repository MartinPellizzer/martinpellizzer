<p>Cephalocarpus glabra, commonly known as the smooth-headed grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in small, smooth, cap-like structures called glumes.</p>
<p>Cephalocarpus glabra is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
