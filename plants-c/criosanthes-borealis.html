                    <h1>Criosanthes borealis</h1>
<p>Criosanthes borealis, commonly known as the Arctic Moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its pale, luminescent blooms that open only under specific light conditions. The plant has adapted to extreme cold by developing a thick, insulating layer of frost-resistant tissue. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is highly sensitive to climate change and habitat disruption.</p>
