                    <h1>Ctenopsis pectinella</h1>
<p>Ctenopsis pectinella, commonly known as the feathered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are often covered in fine, hair-like projections. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaf-like organs called gemmae.</p>
<p>Ctenopsis pectinella plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
