<p>Callipteris microphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Callipteris microphylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is well adapted to wetland habitats.</p>
