<p>Camaridium boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils and open slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
