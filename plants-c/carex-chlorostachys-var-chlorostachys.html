<p>Carex chlorostachys var. chlorostachys, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
