                    <h1>Critoniopsis lindenii</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for various birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
