                    <h1>Cyclosorus granulosus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus granulosus, commonly known as the granular cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely spaced, rounded leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus granulosus is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying bryophyte ecology.</p>
