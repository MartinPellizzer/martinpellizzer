                    <h1>Cyperus strigosus var. capitatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus strigosus var. capitatus, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded wetland habitats.</p>
