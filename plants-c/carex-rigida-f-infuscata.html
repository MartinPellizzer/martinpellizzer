                    <h1>Carex rigida f. infuscata</h1>
<p>Carex rigida f. infuscata, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedges, is a variant of the rigid sedge, characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
