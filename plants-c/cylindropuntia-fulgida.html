<p>Cylindropuntia fulgida, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a shallow root system and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
