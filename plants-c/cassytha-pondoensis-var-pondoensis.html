<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to photosynthesize through its stems.</p>
<p>Cassytha pondoensis var. pondoensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can parasitize a variety of host species.</p>
