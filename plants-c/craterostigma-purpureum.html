                    <h1>Craterostigma purpureum</h1>
<p>Craterostigma purpureum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The purple coloration of its stems and leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also provide some protection against UV radiation.</p>
