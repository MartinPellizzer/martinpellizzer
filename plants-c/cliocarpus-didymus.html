<p>Cliocarpus didymus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils.
