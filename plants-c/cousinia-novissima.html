                    <h1>Cousinia novissima</h1>
<p>Cousinia novissima, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cousinia novissima is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, mountainous areas.</p>
