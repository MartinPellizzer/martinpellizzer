                    <h1>Cyperus ossicaulis</h1>
<p>Cyperus ossicaulis, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively in moist environments.</p>
<p>Cyperus ossicaulis is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
