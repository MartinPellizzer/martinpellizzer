<p>Ceratophyllum muricatum subsp.</p>
<p>muricatum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in tiny, backward-pointing spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light levels and is often found in lakes and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
