<p>Blue everlasting, scientifically known as Cyanothamnus inflexus subsp. grandiflorus, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.

This plant is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its hardy nature and visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile choice for coastal and semi-arid environments. With its unique appearance and resilience, Blue everlasting is a valuable addition to native plant collections.</p>
