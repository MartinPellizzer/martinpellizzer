                    <h1>Chrysanthemum leontopodium</h1>
<p>Chrysanthemum leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, woolly petals and fuzzy, velvety leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude habitats where it is exposed to strong winds and intense sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, producing a striking contrast against the harsh mountain landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and association with resilience, the edelweiss has become a symbol of alpine beauty and ecological adaptation.</p>
