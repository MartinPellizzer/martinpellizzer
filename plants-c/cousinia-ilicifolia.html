                    <h1>Cousinia ilicifolia</h1>
<p>Cousinia ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Cousinia ilicifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
