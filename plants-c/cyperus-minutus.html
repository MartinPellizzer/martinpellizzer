                    <h1>Cyperus minutus</h1>
<p>Cyperus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland, is a small perennial herb native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus minutus plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
