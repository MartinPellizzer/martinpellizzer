                    <h1>Callisia rosea</h1>
<p>Callisia rosea, commonly known as the silver spider plant, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, arching stems covered in small, waxy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
