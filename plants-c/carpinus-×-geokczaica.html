                    <h1>Carpinus × geokczaica</h1>
<p>Carpinus × geokczaica, commonly known as the hybrid hornbeam, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Carpinus betulus and Carpinus caroliniana.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a rugged, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, winged samaras.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
