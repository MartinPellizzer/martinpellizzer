<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with a pale yellow or cream color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
