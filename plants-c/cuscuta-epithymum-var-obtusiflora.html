                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. obtusiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers and has a unique structure of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to infest a variety of host species, including shrubs and herbs. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
