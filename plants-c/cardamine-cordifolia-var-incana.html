<p>Cardamine cordifolia var. incana, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are often submerged or floating in moist or aquatic environments, adapting to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
