                    <h1>Cyclosorus terrestris</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus terrestris, commonly known as the ground liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body composed of a flattened, ribbon-like structure that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Cyclosorus terrestris reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia located on the thallus.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and preference for humid habitats make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
