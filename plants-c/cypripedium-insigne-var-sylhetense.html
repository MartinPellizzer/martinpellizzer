                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. sylhetense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. sylhetense, commonly known as the Sylhet lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a deep pink lip and a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a single flower.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
