                    <h1>Cardaminopsis suecica</h1>
<p>Cardaminopsis suecica, commonly known as the Swedish water clover, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of its close relative, the water crowfoot. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
