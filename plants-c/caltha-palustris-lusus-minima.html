                    <h1>Caltha palustris lusus minima</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris lusus minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
