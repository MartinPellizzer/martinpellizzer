                    <h1>Ctenitis multilobata</h1>
<p>Ctenitis multilobata, commonly known as the multilobed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with multiple lobes that give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology makes it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for researchers studying fern evolution.</p>
