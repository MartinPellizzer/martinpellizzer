                    <h1>Ceriops lucida var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Ceriops lucida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant has prop roots that anchor it in soft, muddy soils and facilitate oxygen absorption. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
