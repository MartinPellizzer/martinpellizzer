                    <h1>Collomia cavanillesii f. unidentata</h1>
<p>Collomia cavanillesii f. unidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved collomia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique floral morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution.</p>
