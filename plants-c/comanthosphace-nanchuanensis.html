<p>Comanthosphace nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan liverwort, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant belonging to the family Comatulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically anchored to submerged substrates. This plant thrives in freshwater environments with low light and stable temperatures, often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are concealed within specialized leaf-like organs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
