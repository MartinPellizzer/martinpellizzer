<p>Cotyledon elegans, commonly known as the "Snow-on-the-Mountain," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically oval or spoon-shaped and can vary in color from green to red or purple depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>Cotyledon elegans is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements.</p>
