<p>Large-headed thistle, scientifically known as Carthamus hispanicus subsp. macrocephalus, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to southern Europe and North Africa. This plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant's spiny leaves and robust structure make it both a resilient and ornamental species. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
