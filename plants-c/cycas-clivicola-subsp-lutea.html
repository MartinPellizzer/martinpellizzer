<p>Cycas clivicola subsp.</p>
<p>lutea, commonly known as the yellow cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with the female cones being yellowish in color, hence the subspecies name *lutea*. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
