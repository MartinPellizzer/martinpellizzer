                    <h1>Chione chiapasensis</h1>
<p>Chione chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
