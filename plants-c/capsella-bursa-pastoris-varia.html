<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris varia, commonly known as the common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, heart-shaped seeds enclosed in a papery capsule, which is a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a common weed in many regions.</p>
