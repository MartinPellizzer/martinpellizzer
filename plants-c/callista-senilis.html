                    <h1>Callista senilis</h1>
<p>Callista senilis, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by delicate, parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Callista senilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
