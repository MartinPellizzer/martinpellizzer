<p>Corethrodendron fruticosum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping corethrodendron, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
