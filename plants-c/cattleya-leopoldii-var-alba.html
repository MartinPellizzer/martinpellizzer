                    <h1>Cattleya leopoldii var. alba</h1>
<p>Cattleya leopoldii var. alba, commonly known as the white leopold cattleya, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pure white flowers, which contrast sharply with the green foliage and velvety leaves. It belongs to the Cymbidieae subfamily and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, long-lasting blooms that typically appear in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
