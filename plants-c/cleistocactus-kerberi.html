                    <h1>Cleistocactus kerberi</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus kerberi, commonly known as the "Moon Cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its unique appearance, with a bright, colorful top and a green, columnar base, makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
