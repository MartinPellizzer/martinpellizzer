                    <h1>Cephalomanes wilkesii</h1>
<p>Cephalomanes wilkesii, commonly known as the Wilkes' sandpiper crab, is a species of crab belonging to the family Ocypodidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated carapace and is typically found in sandy or muddy intertidal zones. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton can sometimes lead to confusion with certain marine plants. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and providing habitat for smaller organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is not a plant but a crustacean, and its botanical features are primarily structural rather than related to photosynthesis.</p>
