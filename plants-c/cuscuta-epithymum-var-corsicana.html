                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. corsicana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. corsicana, commonly known as the Corsican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found growing on shrubs and herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
