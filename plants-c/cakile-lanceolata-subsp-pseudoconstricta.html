<p>Cakile lanceolata subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoconstricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, orbicular to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep taproots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and disturbed areas.</p>
