                    <h1>Cactus echinocactoides</h1>
<p>Cactus echinocactoides, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic.</p>
