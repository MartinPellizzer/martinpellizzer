                    <h1>Cypripedium hirsutissimum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that is densely covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, intricate flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
