                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. apiculatum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. apiculatum, commonly known as the spiked hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and bright green, feathery leaves that are often covered in small, translucent structures called trichomes. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces, making it an important contributor to water filtration. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in aquariums and ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
