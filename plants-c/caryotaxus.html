<p>Caryotaxus, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and showy foliage.</p>
