                    <h1>Crocus ionopharynx</h1>
<p>Crocus ionopharynx, commonly known as the Ionian crocus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family, characterized by its ornamental flowers and grass-like foliage. The plant produces showy, saucer-shaped blooms in shades of yellow and orange during late winter to early spring. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winters, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
