                    <h1>Coronanthera</h1>
<p>Coronanthera, commonly known as the crown orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that resemble a crown, hence their common name. The flowers typically have a white or pale-colored corona, which is a specialized structure in orchids. Coronanthera species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their distinctive morphology and ecological role in their native habitats.</p>
