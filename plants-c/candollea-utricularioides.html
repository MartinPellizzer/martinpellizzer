<p>Candollea utricularioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique and rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
