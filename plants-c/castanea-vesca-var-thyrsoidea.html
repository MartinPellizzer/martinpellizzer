<p>Castanea vesca var. thyrsoidea, commonly known as the thyrsoidean horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in panicles during spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, the sweet chestnut.</p>
