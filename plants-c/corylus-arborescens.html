<p>Corylus arborescens, commonly known as the hazel nut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The nuts are an important food source for wildlife and are also harvested for human consumption.</p>
