                    <h1>Callista commutata</h1>
<p>Callista commutata, commonly known as the yellow sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in dry landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Callista commutata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas.</p>
