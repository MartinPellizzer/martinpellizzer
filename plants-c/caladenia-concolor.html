                    <h1>Caladenia concolor</h1>
<p>Caladenia concolor, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open forest or heathland environments. The plant features a single, slender, pinkish stem that supports a single, narrow, greenish-white flower with a distinctive red lip. Its flowers bloom during late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as thynnid wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing.</p>
