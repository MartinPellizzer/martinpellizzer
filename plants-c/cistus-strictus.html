<p>Cistus strictus, commonly known as rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cistus strictus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
