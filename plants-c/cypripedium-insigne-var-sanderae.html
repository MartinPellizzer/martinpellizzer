                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. sanderae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. sanderae, commonly known as the Sandera's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or red color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a thick, fleshy rhizome that allows it to survive in harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
