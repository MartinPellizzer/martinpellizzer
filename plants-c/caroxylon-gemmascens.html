                    <h1>Caroxylon gemmascens</h1>
<p>Caroxylon gemmascens, commonly known as the gemmascens cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically found on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
