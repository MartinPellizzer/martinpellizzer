                    <h1>Ctenopteris cretata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to rocks or submerged substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, forming dense colonies that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
