<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small, greenish flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant's compact structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for survival in nutrient-poor, dry habitats.</p>
