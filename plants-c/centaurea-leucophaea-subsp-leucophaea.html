<p>Centaurea leucophaea subsp.</p>
<p>leucophaea, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
