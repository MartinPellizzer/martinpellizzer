                    <h1>Corchorus arenarius</h1>
<p>Corchorus arenarius, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed edges, and it is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native habitat.</p>
