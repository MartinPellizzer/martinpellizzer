                    <h1>Cuscuta inflexa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta inflexa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
