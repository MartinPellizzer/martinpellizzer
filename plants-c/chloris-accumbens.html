                    <h1>Chloris accumbens</h1>
<p>Chloris accumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass or carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length and often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
