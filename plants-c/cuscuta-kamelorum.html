                    <h1>Cuscuta kamelorum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kamelorum, commonly known as the Kamel's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on shrubs and herbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
