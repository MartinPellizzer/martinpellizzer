                    <h1>Ctenitis nervata</h1>
<p>Ctenitis nervata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Ctenitis nervata is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
