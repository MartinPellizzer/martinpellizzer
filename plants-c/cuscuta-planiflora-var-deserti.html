                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. deserti</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. deserti, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically attaches to hosts such as creosote bush and various cacti.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant for years.</p>
