                    <h1>Cymbachne guineensis subvar. tectorum</h1>
<p>Cymbachne guineensis subvar. tectorum, commonly known as the African roofgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous rhizomes that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to form dense cover, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
