<p>Cyclosorus × gogoii, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a unique aquatic plant that combines traits from its parent species, Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus gogoii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, creating a visually appealing effect in ponds and water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring moderate to high light conditions. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help clarify water by absorbing nutrients.</p>
