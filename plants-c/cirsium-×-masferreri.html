<p>Cirsium × masferreri, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (common thistle), resulting in a plant with robust growth and spiny foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a woolly texture, while the flowers are purple or pink, arranged in dense clusters. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
