                    <h1>Calycorectes pohlianus</h1>
<p>Calycorectes pohlianus, commonly known as the Pohl's calycorectes, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of ongoing research in the field of evolutionary botany.</p>
