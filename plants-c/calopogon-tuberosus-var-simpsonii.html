                    <h1>Calopogon tuberosus var. simpsonii</h1>
<p>Calopogon tuberosus var. simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's bog orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in acidic, swampy environments, often in association with pine or cypress forests. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, showy, pale yellow or orange flower that blooms in late spring. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, and the plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
