                    <h1>Cactus xanthotrichus</h1>
<p>Cactus xanthotrichus, commonly known as the yellow-haired cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb rainwater.</p>
<p>The plant's name refers to its distinctive yellow bristles, which cover parts of its stems and provide some protection.</p>
