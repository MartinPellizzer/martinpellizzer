                    <h1>Chamaesaracha viscosa</h1>
<p>Chamaesaracha viscosa, commonly known as the sticky chamaesaracha, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glandular leaves that often appear sticky or resinous to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its adaptive features, such as reduced leaf surface and water-storing tissues, enable it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Chamaesaracha viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
