<p>Chaetospora clandestina, commonly known as the hidden haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like structures called rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates. The plant exhibits a typical moss morphology with a leafy stem and small, capsule-like sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of microhabitats in temperate regions.</p>
