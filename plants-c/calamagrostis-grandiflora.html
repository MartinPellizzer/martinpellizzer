                    <h1>Calamagrostis grandiflora</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near wetlands, streams, or in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
