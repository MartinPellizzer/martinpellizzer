                    <h1>Callitriche autumnalis f. linophylla</h1>
<p>Callitriche autumnalis f. linophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of lakes. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche autumnalis.</p>
