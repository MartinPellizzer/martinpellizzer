                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. platyacanthum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. platyacanthum, commonly known as the spiked water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or slightly pointed. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often submerged or just at the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, which can provide habitat for aquatic organisms but may also impact water flow and light penetration.</p>
