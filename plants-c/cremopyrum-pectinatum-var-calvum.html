                    <h1>Cremopyrum pectinatum var. calvum</h1>
<p>Cremopyrum pectinatum var. calvum, commonly known as the smooth leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, often shiny surface. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced pycnidia and lacks the peltate structures found in other varieties of Cremopyrum.</p>
