<p>Cupressus goveniana, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and thick, scaly bark that provides resistance to fire and insects. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are closely packed, giving the tree a dense appearance.</p>
<p>Cupressus goveniana is known for its longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years.</p>
