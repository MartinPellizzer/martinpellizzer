                    <h1>Carpobrotus acinaciformis</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus acinaciformis, commonly known as African ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, sprawling stems and lobed, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
