                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon f. glabrescens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a fine texture. The plant is known for its dense, mat-forming growth, which makes it highly adaptable to various environmental conditions. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly through both underground rhizomes and above-ground stolons contributes to its aggressive growth and resilience.</p>
