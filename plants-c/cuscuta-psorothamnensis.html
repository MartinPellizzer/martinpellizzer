                    <h1>Cuscuta psorothamnensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta psorothamnensis, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is often found parasitizing shrubs and grasses, contributing to the decline of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems.</p>
