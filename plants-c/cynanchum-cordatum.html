<p>Cynanchum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Cynanchum cordatum is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies.</p>
