<p>Centaurium quadrifolium subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as the four-leaf centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its four-leaf morphology, which is less common in other members of the genus. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
