                    <h1>Cladomyza acutata</h1>
<p>Cladomyza acutata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cliffweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features linear, sharply pointed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Cladomyza acutata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
