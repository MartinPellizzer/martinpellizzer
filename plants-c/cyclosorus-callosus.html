                    <h1>Cyclosorus callosus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus callosus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, heart-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus callosus is often found in temperate regions and plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
