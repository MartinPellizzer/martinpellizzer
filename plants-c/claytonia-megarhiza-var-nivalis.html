<p>Claytonia megarhiza var. nivalis, commonly known as the snowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions.</p>
