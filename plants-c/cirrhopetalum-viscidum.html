                    <h1>Cirrhopetalum viscidum</h1>
<p>Cirrhopetalum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky petal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring long, curling petals that resemble tendrils, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, often in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum viscidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
