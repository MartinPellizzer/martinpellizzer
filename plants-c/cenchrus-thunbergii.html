<p>Cenchrus thunbergii, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wiry, slender blades that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
