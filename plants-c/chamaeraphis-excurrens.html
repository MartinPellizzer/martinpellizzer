                    <h1>Chamaeraphis excurrens</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis excurrens, commonly known as the sea bladdergrass, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, due to its specialized adaptations to high salinity. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation in coastal habitats. Its root system is adapted to tolerate waterlogged and salty soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Chamaeraphis excurrens plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
