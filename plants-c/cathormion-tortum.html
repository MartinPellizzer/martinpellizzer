                    <h1>Cathormion tortum</h1>
<p>Cathormion tortum, commonly known as the twisted cathormion, is a unique and rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiraling growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has elongated, fleshy stems that curl tightly around each other, forming a dense, twisted structure. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically pale green or white, and they bloom during the cooler months of the year.</p>
