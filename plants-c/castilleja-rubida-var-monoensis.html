                    <h1>Castilleja rubida var. monoensis</h1>
<p>Castilleja rubida var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono lake red paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, bright red to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
