                    <h1>Cheilanthes × gryphus</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes × gryphus, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes lanuginosa and Cheilanthes tomentosa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
