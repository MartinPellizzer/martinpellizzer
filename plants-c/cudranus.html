                    <h1>Cudranus</h1>
<p>Cudranus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and slow-moving waters of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom. Its flowers open at dawn and close at sunset, a behavior that has inspired cultural and spiritual symbolism in indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Cudranus plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
