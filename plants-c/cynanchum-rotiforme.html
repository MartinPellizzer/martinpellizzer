                    <h1>Cynanchum rotiforme</h1>
<p>Cynanchum rotiforme, commonly known as the twisted milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that often form a dense mat or climb over vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cynanchum rotiforme is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
