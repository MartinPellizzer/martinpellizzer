                    <h1>Celosia prostrata</h1>
<p>Celosia prostrata, commonly known as the flame flower or hedge fire, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces vibrant, feathery bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Celosia prostrata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
