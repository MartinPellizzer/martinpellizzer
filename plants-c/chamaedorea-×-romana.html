<p>Chamaedorea × romana, commonly known as the Roman palm, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Chamaedorea elegans and Chamaedorea umbraculifera.</p>
<p>It is a compact, upright palm with a slender trunk and feather-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt well to indoor conditions.</p>
<p>Chamaedorea × romana requires well-draining soil, moderate watering, and indirect light to flourish.</p>
