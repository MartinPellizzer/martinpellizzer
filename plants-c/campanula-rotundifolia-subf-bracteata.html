<p>Campanula rotundifolia subf.</p>
<p>bracteata, commonly known as the bracted bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are rounded and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is distinguished by the presence of bracts—modified leaves at the base of the flower cluster—that are often smaller and more pronounced than in the typical form.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats.</p>
