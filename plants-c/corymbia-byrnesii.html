                    <h1>Corymbia byrnesii</h1>
<p>Corymbia byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The wood of Corymbia byrnesii is hard and dense, historically valued for its durability and use in traditional Aboriginal tool-making.</p>
