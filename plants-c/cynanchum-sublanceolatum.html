                    <h1>Cynanchum sublanceolatum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum sublanceolatum, commonly known as Chinese milkweed or wild ginseng, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but has ecological significance as a food source for certain insects.</p>
