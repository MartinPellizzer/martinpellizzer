                    <h1>Cleistanthus brideliifolius var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Cleistanthus brideliifolius var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone cleistanthus, is a shrub native to the limestone regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a dense foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to calcareous environments.</p>
