                    <h1>Chamaeraphis paniculifera</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis paniculifera, commonly known as the sea lentil, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dune environments. The plant produces small, green, lens-shaped seeds that are rich in protein and are used as a food source in some regions. Its flowering stems bear clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
