                    <h1>Crepinella neblinae</h1>
<p>Crepinella neblinae, commonly known as the misty crepinella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded understory areas. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in the misty, nutrient-poor environment of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
