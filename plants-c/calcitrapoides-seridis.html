<p>Calcitrapoides seridis, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Calcitrapoides seridis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
