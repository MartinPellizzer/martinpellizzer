                    <h1>Cuscuta laxiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta laxiflora, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
