                    <h1>Crataegus serotina</h1>
<p>Crataegus serotina, commonly known as the late flowering hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus serotina is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a wildlife habitat and a contributor to forest biodiversity.</p>
