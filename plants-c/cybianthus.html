<p>Cybianthus, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats like swamps and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Cybianthus produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
