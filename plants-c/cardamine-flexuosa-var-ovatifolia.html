<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate in shape, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rich, organic soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is an indicator species for riparian habitats.</p>
