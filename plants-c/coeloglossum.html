                    <h1>Coeloglossum</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its fleshy, scale-like structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the branches of longleaf pine trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
