                    <h1>Cryophytum subulatum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum subulatum, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant has a unique adaptation to extreme cold, with its leaves covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and fragile species, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
