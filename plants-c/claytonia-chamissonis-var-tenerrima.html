                    <h1>Claytonia chamissonis var. tenerrima</h1>
<p>Claytonia chamissonis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the Sierra glacierweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
