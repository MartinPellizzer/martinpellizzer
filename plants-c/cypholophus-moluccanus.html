<p>Cypholophus moluccanus, commonly known as the Moluccan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded forest undergrowth where it grows.</p>
<p>Cypholophus moluccanus is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
