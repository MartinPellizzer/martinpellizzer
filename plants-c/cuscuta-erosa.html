                    <h1>Cuscuta erosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta erosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including crops and wild vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
