<p>Coincya monensis var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically submerged, with the fronds often arching downward, giving it a graceful, flowing look.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental ponds and aquariums for its aesthetic value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life.</p>
