                    <h1>Cryptophragmium</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium, commonly known as the ghost lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, crust-like growth form and often appears as a pale or whitish film on rock surfaces. The thallus of Cryptophragmium is typically composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. These lichens are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or cliff faces.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes them important indicators of environmental health and stability.</p>
