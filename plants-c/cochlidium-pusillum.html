                    <h1>Cochlidium pusillum</h1>
<p>Cochlidium pusillum, commonly known as the small cochlid, is a small, terrestrial gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Cochlididae.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, forested environments, where it thrives in leaf litter and under rocks. The shell of Cochlidium pusillum is slender and conical, with a smooth surface and a spiral pattern that becomes more pronounced as the shell matures. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to the decomposition process in its habitat.</p>
<p>This species plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its environment.</p>
