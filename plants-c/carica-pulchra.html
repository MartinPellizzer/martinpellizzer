<p>Carica pulchra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf banana, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by edible, banana-like fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread.</p>
