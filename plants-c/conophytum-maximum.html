<p>Conophytum maximum, commonly known as the "Twin Rock" or "Cape Flax," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paired leaves that resemble small stones, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its compact foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Conophytum maximum is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
