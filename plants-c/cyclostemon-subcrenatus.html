                    <h1>Cyclostemon subcrenatus</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon subcrenatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cyclostemon, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring smooth, undulating margins that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclostemon subcrenatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
