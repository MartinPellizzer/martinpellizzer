                    <h1>Cylindropuntia fulgida var. fulgida</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia fulgida var. fulgida, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>The golden cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
