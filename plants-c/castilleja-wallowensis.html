                    <h1>Castilleja wallowensis</h1>
<p>Castilleja wallowensis, commonly known as the Wallowa Indian Paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange inflorescences that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Castilleja wallowensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
