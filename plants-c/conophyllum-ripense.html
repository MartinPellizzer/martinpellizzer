<p>Conophyllum ripense, commonly known as the river conophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverine habitats of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, characterized by its fibrous, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Conophyllum ripense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
