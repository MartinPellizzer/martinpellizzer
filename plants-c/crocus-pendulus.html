                    <h1>Crocus pendulus</h1>
<p>Crocus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants.</p>
