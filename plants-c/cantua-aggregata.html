                    <h1>Cantua aggregata</h1>
<p>Cantua aggregata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native climate.</p>
<p>Cantua aggregata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
