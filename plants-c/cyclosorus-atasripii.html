<p>Cyclosorus atasripii, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus atasripii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
