                            <h1>Coryphantha Daimonoceras</h1>
<p>Coryphantha daimonoceras, scientifically known as Coryphantha daimonoceras, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the deserts of North America. This plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from both heat and herbivores. It blooms with vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
