                    <h1>Carludovica angustifolia</h1>
<p>Carludovica angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant with spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a splash of color to its desert habitat. It is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
