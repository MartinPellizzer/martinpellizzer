<p>Cotoneaster miniatus, commonly known as the miniature cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster miniatus is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types once established.</p>
