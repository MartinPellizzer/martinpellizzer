<p>Cladium bahiense, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that often have serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cladium bahiense plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
