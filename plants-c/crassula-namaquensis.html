<p>Crassula namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua Crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the warmer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
