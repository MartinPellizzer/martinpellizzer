<p>Cyperus cuanzensis, commonly known as the Guangxi flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Cyperus cuanzensis is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and potential medicinal properties.</p>
