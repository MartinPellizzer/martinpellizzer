                    <h1>Chauliodon buntingii</h1>
<p>Chauliodon buntingii, commonly known as the golden sandbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chauliodon buntingii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
