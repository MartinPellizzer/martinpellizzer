                    <h1>Canna robusta</h1>
<p>Canna robusta, commonly known as the giant cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vigorously, often forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>Canna robusta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
