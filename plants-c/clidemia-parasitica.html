                    <h1>Clidemia parasitica</h1>
<p>Clidemia parasitica, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Clidemia, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited leaf tissue. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
