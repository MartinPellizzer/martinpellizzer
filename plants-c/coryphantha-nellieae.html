                    <h1>Coryphantha nellieae</h1>
<p>Coryphantha nellieae, commonly known as Nellie's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dark green, ribbed stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Coryphantha nellieae plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
