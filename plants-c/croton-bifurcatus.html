                    <h1>Croton bifurcatus</h1>
<p>Croton bifurcatus, commonly known as the two-lobed croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
