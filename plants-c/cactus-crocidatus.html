                    <h1>Cactus crocidatus</h1>
<p>Cactus crocidatus, commonly known as the red cactus, is a spiny, succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, backward-pointing spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Cactus crocidatus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
