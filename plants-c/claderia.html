                    <h1>Claderia</h1>
<p>Claderia, commonly known as the "false lichen," is a genus of lichens that belong to the family Cladoniaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are composite structures formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Claderia species are typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate and boreal forests. They are characterized by their foliose or fruticose growth forms and often have a distinctive, branched appearance.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Claderia is important for understanding lichen diversity and their ecological roles in forest ecosystems.</p>
