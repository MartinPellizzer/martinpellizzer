The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulant effects.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used traditionally in social and religious contexts across its native regions.</p>
