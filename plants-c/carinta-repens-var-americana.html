<p>Carinta repens var. americana, commonly known as the American trailing ardisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green oval leaves that are arranged in a trailing manner, often cascading from hanging baskets or ground covers. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal berries, though it is considered invasive in some regions.</p>
