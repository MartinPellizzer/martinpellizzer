                    <h1>Carpopodium carnosum</h1>
<p>Carpopodium carnosum, commonly known as the red alga, is a species of marine algae belonging to the order Rhodophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red to pink coloration, which results from the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that allows it to absorb light for photosynthesis. This organism typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its thallus is filamentous and branched, with a gelatinous texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Carpopodium carnosum plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
