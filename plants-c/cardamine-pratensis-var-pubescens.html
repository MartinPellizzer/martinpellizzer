                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream banks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, upright inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor it in wet soils and facilitate vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems is a distinguishing characteristic that aids in reducing water loss and providing protection against herbivory.</p>
