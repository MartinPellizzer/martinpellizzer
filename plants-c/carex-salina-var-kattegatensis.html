<p>Carex salina var. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish wetland environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. It produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
