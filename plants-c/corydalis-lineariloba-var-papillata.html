                    <h1>Corydalis lineariloba var. papillata</h1>
<p>Corydalis lineariloba var. papillata, commonly known as the papillate threadleaf lousewort, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique feature is the presence of papillae—small, raised bumps—on the surface of its leaves, which give it its specific variety name.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties.</p>
