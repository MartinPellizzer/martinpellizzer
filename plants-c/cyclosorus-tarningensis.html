<p>Cyclosorus tarningensis, commonly known as the Tarninges moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are embedded within the thallus and release spores under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus tarningensis is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental quality.</p>
