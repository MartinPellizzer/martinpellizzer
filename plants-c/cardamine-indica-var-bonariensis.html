                    <h1>Cardamine indica var. bonariensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine indica var. bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its rhizomes are capable of rapid growth, allowing it to spread efficiently in wetlands and along stream edges.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
