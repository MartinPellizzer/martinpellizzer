                    <h1>Carex tergestina</h1>
<p>Carex tergestina, commonly known as the Tergestina sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water retention.</p>
<p>Carex tergestina plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
