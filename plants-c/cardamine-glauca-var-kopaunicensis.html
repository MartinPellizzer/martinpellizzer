                    <h1>Cardamine glauca var. kopaunicensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine glauca var. kopaunicensis, commonly known as the Kopaonik watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
