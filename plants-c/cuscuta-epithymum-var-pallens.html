                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. pallens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. pallens, commonly known as the pale dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless, thread-like stems. The plant is typically found growing on various host plants, including grasses and other weeds. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
