                    <h1>Caucalis bifrons var. subtuberculata</h1>
<p>Caucalis bifrons var. subtuberculata, commonly known as the small-fruited bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more tuberculate (wart-like) fruits compared to the typical form of Caucalis bifrons.</p>
