                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona live-bearing cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by live-bearing fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to propagate through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the fruit before it is fully mature.</p>
