                    <h1>Callitriche angustifolia</h1>
<p>Callitriche angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom above the water, usually in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and branching, allowing it to spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche angustifolia is often found in still or slow-moving waters and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich conditions.</p>
