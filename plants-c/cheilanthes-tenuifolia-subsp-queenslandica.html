<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that form a dense, shield-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces spores in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
