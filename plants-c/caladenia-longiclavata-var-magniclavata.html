<p>Caladenia longiclavata var. magniclavata, commonly known as the large-clawed spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated, recurved sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive hooded labellum that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
