                    <h1>Ceratozamia longifolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia longifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth and distinctive, palm-like appearance with stiff, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
