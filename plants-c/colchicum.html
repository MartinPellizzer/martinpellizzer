                    <h1>Colchicum</h1>
<p>Colchicum, commonly known as the meadow saffron, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Colchicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. They typically have basal leaves and produce toxic, bulb-like structures called corms. Colchicum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its medicinal and toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of colchicine, a compound used in medical treatments.</p>
