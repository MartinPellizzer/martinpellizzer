                    <h1>Cladium punctatum</h1>
<p>Cladium punctatum, commonly known as the punctate sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow, freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Cladium punctatum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
