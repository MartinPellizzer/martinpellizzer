                    <h1>Corybas mankiensis</h1>
<p>Corybas mankiensis, commonly known as the Manki's hooded orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter, reflecting its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
