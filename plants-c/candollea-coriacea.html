                    <h1>Candollea coriacea</h1>
<p>Candollea coriacea, commonly known as the rough leaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Candollea coriacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
