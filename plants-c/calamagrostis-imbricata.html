<p>Calamagrostis imbricata, commonly known as the silvergrass or bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis imbricata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
