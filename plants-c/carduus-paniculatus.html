                    <h1>Carduus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Carduus paniculatus, commonly known as the greater thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
