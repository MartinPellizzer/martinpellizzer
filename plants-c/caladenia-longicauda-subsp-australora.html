<p>Caladenia longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>australora, commonly known as the Western River Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid endemic to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy pink or purple flower that has a distinctive, elongated labellum.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near rivers and seasonal wetlands, thriving in areas with seasonal rainfall. Its flowers bloom during late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as thynnid wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land-use pressures.</p>
