<p>Cereus speciosissimus var. vandesii, commonly known as the Van der Veldt's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage is minimal, with leaves typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This plant is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit.</p>
