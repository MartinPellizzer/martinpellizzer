                    <h1>Cogswellia concinna</h1>
<p>Cogswellia concinna, commonly known as the dwarf zebra cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and distinctive ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its fleshy stems are covered in small, white spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cogswellia concinna is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
