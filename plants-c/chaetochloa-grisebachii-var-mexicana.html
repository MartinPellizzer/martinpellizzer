                    <h1>Chaetochloa grisebachii var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa grisebachii var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which reflects its adaptation to hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and landscape design in drought-prone areas.</p>
