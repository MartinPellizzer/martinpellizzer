                    <h1>Carex polystachya var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex polystachya var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basket sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. This variety is smaller than the typical Carex polystachya, with compact growth and dense foliage that often forms a low-growing mat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
