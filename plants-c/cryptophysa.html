                    <h1>Cryptophysa</h1>
<p>Cryptophysa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cryptophysa thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
