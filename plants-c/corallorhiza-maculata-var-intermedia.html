                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata var. intermedia, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is found in forested areas across eastern North America. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers with a distinctive corolla shape. It typically grows in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific hosts and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
