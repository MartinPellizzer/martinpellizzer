<p>Cynanchum alternilobum, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features opposite, alternate, and sometimes whorled leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, while its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap and toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
