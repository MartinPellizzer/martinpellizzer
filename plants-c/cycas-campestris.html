                    <h1>Cycas campestris</h1>
<p>Cycas campestris, commonly known as the field cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Cycas campestris is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
