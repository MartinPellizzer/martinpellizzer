                            <h1>Cistanche Violacea</h1>
<p>Yellow cistanche, scientifically known as Cistanche violacea, is a parasitic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for its nutrients, making it a unique member of the Orobanchaceae family. This plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. While it is not commonly cultivated, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ecological role and medicinal potential continue to attract scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
