                    <h1>Coleocarya gracilis</h1>
<p>Coleocarya gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a key aspect of its botanical biology. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Coleocarya gracilis is considered endangered, making its conservation a priority for botanists and ecologists.</p>
