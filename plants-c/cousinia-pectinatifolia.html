<p>Cousinia pectinatifolia, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and woolly, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Cousinia pectinatifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
