                    <h1>Cestrum venenatum</h1>
<p>Cestrum venenatum, commonly known as the nightshade or poison berry, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, red berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids such as cestrotine and cestrumine. While its beauty makes it a popular ornamental plant, its toxicity requires caution in cultivation and handling.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its use in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are not well-documented.</p>
