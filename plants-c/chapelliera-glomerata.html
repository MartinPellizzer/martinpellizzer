                    <h1>Chapelliera glomerata</h1>
<p>Chapelliera glomerata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Chapelliera glomerata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals.</p>
