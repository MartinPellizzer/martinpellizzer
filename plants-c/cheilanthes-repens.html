                    <h1>Cheilanthes repens</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes repens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically narrow and pinnately compound, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
