<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a slight pinkish tinge. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Cochleanthes candida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
