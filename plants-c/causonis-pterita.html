<p>Causonis pterita, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
