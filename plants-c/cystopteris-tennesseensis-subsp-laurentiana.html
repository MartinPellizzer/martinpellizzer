<p>Cystopteris tennesseensis subsp.</p>
<p>laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and along rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the genus Cystopteris.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and ecological specificity, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
