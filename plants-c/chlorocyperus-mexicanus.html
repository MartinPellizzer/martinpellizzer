<p>Chlorocyperus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican greenbulrush, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
