                    <h1>Cuscuta stuckertii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta stuckertii, commonly known as the Stuckert's dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting the growth and survival of the host plant.</p>
