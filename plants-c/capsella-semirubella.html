<p>Capsella semirubella, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lobed leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Capsella semirubella is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in traditional medicine and agriculture.</p>
