<p>Calystegia catesbeiana, commonly known as the false bindweed, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a strong, creeping growth habit and can spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
