                    <h1>Cuscuta scandens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta scandens, commonly known as the dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to various plants using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on crops, shrubs, and other vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants.</p>
