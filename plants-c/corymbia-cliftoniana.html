<p>Corymbia cliftoniana, commonly known as the Clifton's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Corymbia cliftoniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
