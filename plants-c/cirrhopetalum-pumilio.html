The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
