                    <h1>Cocos nucifera var. fragilis</h1>
<p>Cocos nucifera var. fragilis, commonly known as the coconut dwarf, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its shorter stature and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically narrower and more compact compared to the standard coconut palm, and it produces smaller, less oily coconuts. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and resilience in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in both ecological and economic systems in its native habitats.</p>
