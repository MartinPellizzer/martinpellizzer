                    <h1>Cysticorydalis crassissima</h1>
<p>Cysticorydalis crassissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily, is a striking member of the Liliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, it is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
