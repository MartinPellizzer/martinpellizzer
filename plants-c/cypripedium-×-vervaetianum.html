                    <h1>Cypripedium × vervaetianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × vervaetianum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humusy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat sensitivity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
