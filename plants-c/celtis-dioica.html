<p>Celtis dioica, commonly known as the fragrant cedar or nettle tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are separate between male and female plants, making it dioecious. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red or black as it matures.</p>
<p>Celtis dioica is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
