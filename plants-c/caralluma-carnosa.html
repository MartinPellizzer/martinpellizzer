                    <h1>Caralluma carnosa</h1>
<p>Caralluma carnosa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem with cylindrical, fleshy segments that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma carnosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
