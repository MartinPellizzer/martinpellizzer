                    <h1>Cuscuta gigantea var. engelmannii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gigantea var. engelmannii, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to North America and commonly infests agricultural crops such as corn and sunflowers. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
