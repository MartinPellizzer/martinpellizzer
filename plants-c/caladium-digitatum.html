                    <h1>Caladium digitatum</h1>
<p>Caladium digitatum, commonly known as the pink wing caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate, wavy patterns in shades of pink, white, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not typically cultivated for their visual appeal.</p>
<p>Caladium digitatum is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds where it can flourish without direct sunlight.</p>
