                    <h1>Calanthe francoisii</h1>
<p>Calanthe francoisii, commonly known as the Fran√ßois's calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
