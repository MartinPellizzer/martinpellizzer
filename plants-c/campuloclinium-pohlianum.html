                    <h1>Campuloclinium pohlianum</h1>
<p>Campuloclinium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>While it lacks the stinging hairs of true nettles, it shares similar ecological roles in its habitat.</p>
