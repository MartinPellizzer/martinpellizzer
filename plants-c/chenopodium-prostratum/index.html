                            <h1>Chenopodium Prostratum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium prostratum is a low-growing plant commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is known for its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This species is often used as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional value. Its small, green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible seeds. Despite its simple appearance, Chenopodium prostratum plays an important role in desert ecosystems.</p>
