                    <h1>Cedrus libani</h1>
<p>Cedrus libani, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a tall, evergreen conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. The plant produces male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, elongated seed capsules that release seeds in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous areas with a cool climate.</p>
<p>Due to historical deforestation, it is now considered a rare and protected species.</p>
