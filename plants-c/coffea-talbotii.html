<p>Coffea talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's coffee, is a rare and endangered species native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that produces small, red berries containing its seeds, which are used to make coffee. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it has a unique floral structure with white petals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
