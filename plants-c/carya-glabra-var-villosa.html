<p>Carya glabra var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, a feature common in many hickory species.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
