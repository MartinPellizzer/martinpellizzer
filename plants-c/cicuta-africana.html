                    <h1>Cicuta africana</h1>
<p>Cicuta africana, commonly known as African water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is highly poisonous due to the presence of cicutoxin. The plant has a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. It typically grows near water sources and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme toxicity, it should never be handled or ingested without proper knowledge and protective equipment.</p>
