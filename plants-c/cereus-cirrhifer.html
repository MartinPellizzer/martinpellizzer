<p>Cereus cirrhifer, commonly known as the long-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a flowering cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cereus cirrhifer is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
