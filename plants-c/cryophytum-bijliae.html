                    <h1>Cryophytum bijliae</h1>
<p>Cryophytum bijliae, commonly known as the Namib Desert ice plant, is a rare succulent native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in extreme conditions, storing water in its fleshy, blue-green leaves to survive prolonged droughts. The plant produces small, white flowers during the brief rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its unique adaptations, such as a waxy cuticle and shallow root system, enable it to absorb moisture from fog and dew.</p>
<p>Cryophytum bijliae is a symbol of resilience in one of the harshest environments on Earth.</p>
