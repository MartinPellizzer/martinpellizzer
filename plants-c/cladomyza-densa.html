                    <h1>Cladomyza densa</h1>
<p>Cladomyza densa, commonly known as the dense cladon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Cladomyza densa is adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
