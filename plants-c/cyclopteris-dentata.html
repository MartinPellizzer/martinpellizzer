                    <h1>Cyclopteris dentata</h1>
<p>Cyclopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed cyclopteris, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly pinnate fronds that are often divided into tooth-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are somewhat fleshy and can spread to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
