                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. notacanthum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. notacanthum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, whorled leaves that are typically 2â€“4 mm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering water quality.</p>
