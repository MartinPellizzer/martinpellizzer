<p>Chrysoglossum delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's chrysoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of China.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to their dense pubescence.</p>
<p>Chrysoglossum delavayi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
