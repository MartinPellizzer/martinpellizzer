<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland floors.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with consistent moisture and partial to full shade, making it a characteristic species of riparian and montane habitats.</p>
