<p>Cynosurus scoparius, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of minute hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are small and compact.</p>
<p>Cynosurus scoparius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
