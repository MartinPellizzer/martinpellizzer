                    <h1>Casuarina angulata</h1>
<p>Casuarina angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a medium to large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant has small, needle-like leaves arranged in spiral clusters, which are modified into phyllodes, a feature typical of many acacia species. Its flowers are small and grouped in spikes, producing a fragrant, yellowish-green bloom that attracts various pollinators.</p>
<p>Casuarina angulata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in reforestation and erosion control.</p>
