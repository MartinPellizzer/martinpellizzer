<p>Cristaria mendocina, commonly known as the Mendoza marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
