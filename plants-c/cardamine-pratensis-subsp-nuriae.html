<p>Cardamine pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>nuriae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a garnish due to their sharp, spicy flavor.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Cardamine pratensis.</p>
