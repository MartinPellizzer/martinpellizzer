<p>Cyperus arsenei, commonly known as the arsenic flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and often grows in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
