<p>Cylindropuntia intermedia, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its spines are modified into stiff, needle-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
