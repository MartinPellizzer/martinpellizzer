<p>Chondrorhyncha bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or whitish on the underside. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock surfaces and soil banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
