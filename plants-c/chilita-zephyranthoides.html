                    <h1>Chilita zephyranthoides</h1>
<p>Chilita zephyranthoides, commonly known as the cloudland bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form low mats, adapting to its alpine environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Chilita zephyranthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
