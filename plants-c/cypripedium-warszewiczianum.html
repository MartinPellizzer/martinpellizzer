<p>Cypripedium warszewiczianum, commonly known as the Warszewicz's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the forests of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
