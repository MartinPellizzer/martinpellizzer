<p>Caralluma hexagona, commonly known as the stonecress or desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange, often blooming in the morning. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma hexagona is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional remedies.</p>
