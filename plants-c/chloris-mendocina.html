                    <h1>Chloris mendocina</h1>
<p>Chloris mendocina, commonly known as Mendo grass, is a perennial grass native to California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a groundcover.</p>
