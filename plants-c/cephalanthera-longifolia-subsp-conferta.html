<p>Cephalanthera longifolia subsp.</p>
<p>conferta, commonly known as the clustered helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and the subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
