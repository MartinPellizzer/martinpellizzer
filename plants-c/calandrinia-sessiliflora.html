<p>Calandrinia sessiliflora, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is adapted to store water in its thick stems and leaves. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Calandrinia sessiliflora is often considered a weed but has ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers.</p>
