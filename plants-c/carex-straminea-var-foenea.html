                    <h1>Carex straminea var. foenea</h1>
<p>Carex straminea var. foenea, commonly known as the foenea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
