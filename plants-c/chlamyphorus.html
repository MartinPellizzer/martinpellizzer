<p>Chlamyphorus, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help them retain water in arid environments. They are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats, where they tolerate high levels of salinity. The flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are usually green or reddish in color.</p>
<p>Chlamyphorus species are important in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
