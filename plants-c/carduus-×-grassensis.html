                    <h1>Carduus × grassensis</h1>
<p>Carduus × grassensis, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant that results from the cross between Carduus nutans and Cirsium arvense.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and purple to pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are arranged in a composite head.</p>
<p>Carduus × grassensis is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
