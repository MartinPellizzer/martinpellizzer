                <h1>Ctenopteris subtilis</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris subtilis, commonly known as the slender sea palm, is a species of marine fern that thrives in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, though it is not closely related to true palms. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate saltwater, making it a common sight in intertidal zones along tropical and subtropical shores. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris subtilis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
