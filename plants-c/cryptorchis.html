                    <h1>Cryptorchis</h1>
<p>Cryptorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its secretive nature, Cryptorchis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
