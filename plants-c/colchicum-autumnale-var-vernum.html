                    <h1>Colchicum autumnale var. vernum</h1>
<p>Colchicum autumnale var. vernum, commonly known as the spring deathcap, is a toxic plant species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its early blooming habit, with white to pale purple flowers appearing in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom before the leaves fully develop. It contains toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which can be fatal if ingested.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with edible mushrooms, making it a significant hazard in natural environments.</p>
