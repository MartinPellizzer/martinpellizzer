<p>Cotyledon semiensis, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cotyledon semiensis is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
