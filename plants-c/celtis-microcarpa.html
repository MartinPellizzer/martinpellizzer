<p>Celtis microcarpa, commonly known as the little-leaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, greenish fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. Celtis microcarpa is often found in moist bottomlands and along streams, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow.</p>
<p>Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
