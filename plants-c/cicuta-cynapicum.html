                    <h1>Cicuta cynapicum</h1>
<p>Cicuta cynapicum, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is distinguished by its umbrella-like inflorescence and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white flowers and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its most notable feature is the presence of cicutoxin, a potent toxin that makes it one of the most dangerous plants in the region.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant.</p>
