<p>Cypripedium guttatum var. yatabeanum, commonly known as the Yatabean moccasin, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a yellow lip and a greenish-white dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, large bloom during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
