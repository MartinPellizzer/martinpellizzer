                    <h1>Carex depressa var. basilaris</h1>
<p>Carex depressa var. basilaris, commonly known as the basal sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
