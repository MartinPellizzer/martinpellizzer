                    <h1>Cuscuta hygrophilae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta hygrophilae, commonly known as the water dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often covering its host with a dense network of yellowish stems. The plant is typically found in moist environments, such as wetlands and along stream banks, where it can establish itself on a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, water, or animals, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta hygrophilae plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and serving as a food source for certain insects and animals.</p>
