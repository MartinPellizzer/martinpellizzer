                    <h1>Cinnamomum pauciflorum var. tazia</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum pauciflorum var. tazia, commonly known as Tazian cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cinnamon tree native to the mountainous regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic, bark-like leaves that emit a subtle cinnamon scent. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it remains a rare and under-studied species.</p>
