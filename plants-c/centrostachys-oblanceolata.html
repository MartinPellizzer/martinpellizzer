                    <h1>Centrostachys oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Centrostachys oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf centrostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, oblanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Centrostachys oblanceolata is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in dry grasslands.</p>
