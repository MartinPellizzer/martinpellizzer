                    <h1>Cyclosorus × incestus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × incestus, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant that combines traits from its parent species.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features delicate, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual propagation, with spores playing a key role in its life cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
