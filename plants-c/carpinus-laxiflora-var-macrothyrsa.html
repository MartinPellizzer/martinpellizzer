                    <h1>Carpinus laxiflora var. macrothyrsa</h1>
<p>Carpinus laxiflora var. macrothyrsa, commonly known as the large-thorned hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by woody, edible fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive bark and seasonal foliage changes.</p>
