                    <h1>Cosmos peucedanifolius var. tiraquensis</h1>
<p>Cosmos peucedanifolius var. tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraquense cosmos, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cosmos genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
