                    <h1>Chaetospora deusta</h1>
<p>Chaetospora deusta, commonly known as the velvet tunicate, is a marine colonial organism belonging to the class Ascidiacea.</p>
<p>It forms dense, gelatinous colonies that are often found attached to submerged surfaces such as rocks and ship hulls. The plant-like structure of Chaetospora deusta consists of a central tunicate body with numerous zooids, each containing a digestive system and a heart. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique structure and ecological impact in coastal environments.</p>
