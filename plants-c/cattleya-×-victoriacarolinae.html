<p>Cattleya × victoriacarolinae, commonly known as the Victoria Carolina orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with periodic dry spells.</p>
<p>The orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and unique floral display.</p>
