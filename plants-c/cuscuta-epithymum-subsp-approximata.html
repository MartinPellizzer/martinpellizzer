                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum subsp. approximata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum subsp.</p>
<p>approximata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants.</p>
<p>The plant is widespread in various habitats, including fields, gardens, and disturbed areas. It is often considered a weed due to its ability to infest a wide range of host species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
