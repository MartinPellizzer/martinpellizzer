                    <h1>Conchocarpus dasyanthus</h1>
<p>Conchocarpus dasyanthus, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It typically grows in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and tidal flats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in saltwater ecosystems.</p>
