                    <h1>Calamagrostis deserticola</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis deserticola, commonly known as the desert grass or desert reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and tufted growth habit, adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis deserticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
