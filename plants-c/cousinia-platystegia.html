<p>Cousinia platystegia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Cousinia platystegia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
