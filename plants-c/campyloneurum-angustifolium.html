<p>Campyloneurum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, helping to stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually submerged or floating, with spore-producing structures located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
