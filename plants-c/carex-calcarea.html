<p>Carex calcarea, commonly known as limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces berries that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Carex calcarea plays a role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments and supports local biodiversity.</p>
