                    <h1>Craterostigma newtonii</h1>
<p>Craterostigma newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's rockcress, is a small, perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
