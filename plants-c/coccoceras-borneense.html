                    <h1>Coccoceras borneense</h1>
<p>Coccoceras borneense, commonly known as the Bornean coccolith, is a unique marine alga belonging to the class Chlorophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape and the presence of calcified plates called coccoliths, which are arranged in a complex pattern. This organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a role in primary productivity. Its life cycle includes both asexual and sexual reproduction, contributing to its ecological significance in marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and composition make it an important subject for studies in marine botany and paleontology.</p>
