<p>Cardia orbicularis, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular, or heart-shaped, thallus that is typically green and grows close to the ground. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple structure composed of a single layer of cells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid regions with rich soil.</p>
<p>Cardia orbicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms.</p>
