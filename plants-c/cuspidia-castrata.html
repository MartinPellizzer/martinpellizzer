<p>Cuspidia castrata, commonly known as the Cape York cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Cuspidia castrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
