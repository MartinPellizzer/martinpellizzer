<p>Cordia superba, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually ovate leaves with a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Cordia superba is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
