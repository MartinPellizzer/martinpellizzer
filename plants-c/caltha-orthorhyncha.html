                    <h1>Caltha orthorhyncha</h1>
<p>Caltha orthorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often near streams, ponds, or in marshy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers consist of numerous stamens surrounding a central pistil, making it an attractive plant for pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
