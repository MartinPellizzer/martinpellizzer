                    <h1>Cleistocactus muyurinensis</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus muyurinensis, commonly known as the "pale moon cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically pale green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, pale flowers that open only at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a shallow root system and a capacity to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
