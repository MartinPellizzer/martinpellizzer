                    <h1>Crocus marasensis</h1>
<p>Crocus marasensis, commonly known as the Maras saffron crocus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid orange flowers that bloom in the early spring, typically in the months of April and May. The plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are surrounded by a dense cluster of leaf-like bracts, which give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is closely associated with the traditional saffron production in the region, as its stigmas are used to produce a valuable yellow dye.</p>
