                    <h1>Cactus obconella</h1>
<p>Cactus obconella, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, flowering plant that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, and its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
