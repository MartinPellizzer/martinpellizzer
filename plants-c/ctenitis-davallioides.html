                    <h1>Ctenitis davallioides</h1>
<p>Ctenitis davallioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its natural habitat.</p>
