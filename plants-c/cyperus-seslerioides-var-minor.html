                    <h1>Cyperus seslerioides var. minor</h1>
<p>Cyperus seslerioides var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
