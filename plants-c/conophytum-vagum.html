<p>Conophytum vagum, commonly known as the "Lenten rose," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Conophytum vagum requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
