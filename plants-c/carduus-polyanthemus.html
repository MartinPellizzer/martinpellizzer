                    <h1>Carduus polyanthemus</h1>
<p>Carduus polyanthemus, commonly known as the musk thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>The plant's latex contains a strong, musky odor, which is released when the leaves are damaged.</p>
