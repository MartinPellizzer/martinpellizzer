<p>Crocodeilanthe bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot√° fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rock surfaces in montane forests. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
