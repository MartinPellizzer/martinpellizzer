                    <h1>Cheilanthes tripinnata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes tripinnata, commonly known as the three-fingered rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes tripinnata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
