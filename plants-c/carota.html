                    <h1>Carota</h1>
<p>Carota, commonly known as the carrot, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, tapering root, which is the primary edible part, and its feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot's genus, Daucus. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which gives them their orange color and provides health benefits.</p>
<p>They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
