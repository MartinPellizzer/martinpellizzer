<p>Cynorkis angustipetala var. oligadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces small, clustered female cones and male cones that are typically found on separate plants. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
