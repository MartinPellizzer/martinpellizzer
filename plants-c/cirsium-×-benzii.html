                    <h1>Cirsium × benzii</h1>
<p>Cirsium × benzii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parent species. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with marginal spines, while the stems are upright and hairy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
