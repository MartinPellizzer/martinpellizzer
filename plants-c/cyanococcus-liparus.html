                    <h1>Cyanococcus liparus</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus liparus, commonly known as the desert holly, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyanococcus liparus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
