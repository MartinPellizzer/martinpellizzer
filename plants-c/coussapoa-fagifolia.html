<p>Coussapoa fagifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
