                    <h1>Callitriche cophocarpa</h1>
<p>Callitriche cophocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterstar, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Hydrocharitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, which later develop into small, round fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
