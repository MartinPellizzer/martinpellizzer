                    <h1>Cyperus falcatus var. hamiensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus falcatus var. hamiensis, commonly known as the Hami flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowering spikes that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
