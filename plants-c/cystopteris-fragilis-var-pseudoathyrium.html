<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. pseudoathyrium, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate, herbaceous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green and somewhat translucent. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fragile, papery fronds give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its common name.</p>
