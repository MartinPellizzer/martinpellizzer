                    <h1>Ceratocarpus salinus</h1>
<p>Ceratocarpus salinus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Ceratocarpus salinus is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
