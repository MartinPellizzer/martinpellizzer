                    <h1>Cyperus olfersianus</h1>
<p>Cyperus olfersianus, commonly known as umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive inflorescence that resembles an umbrella, composed of numerous spikelets arranged in a spherical cluster. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Cyperus olfersianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
