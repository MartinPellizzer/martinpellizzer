                    <h1>Cerefolium nitidum</h1>
<p>Cerefolium nitidum, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
