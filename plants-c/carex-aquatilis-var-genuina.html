                    <h1>Carex aquatilis var. genuina</h1>
<p>Carex aquatilis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens.</p>
