<p>Centaurea solstitialis subsp.</p>
<p>pyracantha, commonly known as the California fiddleneck, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that appear in late summer, typically around the summer solstice, hence its species name.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive, thistle-like seed head. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
