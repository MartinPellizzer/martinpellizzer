                    <h1>Coffea congensis var. oubanghensis</h1>
<p>Coffea congensis var. oubanghensis, commonly known as the Oubanghi coffee, is a wild coffee species native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries containing two seeds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. It is not widely cultivated due to its limited distribution and the challenges of growing it outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its botanical interest, it remains a rare and less-studied species within the Coffea genus.</p>
