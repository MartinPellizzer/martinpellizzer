<p>Crataegus azarolus proles ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinian hawthorn, is a rare subspecies of the hawthorn plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring and its red, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in dry, open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
