                    <h1>Cucumis colocynthis</h1>
<p>Cucumis colocynthis, commonly known as bitter cucumber or colocynth, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a rough, spiny fruit that contains a bitter, toxic pulp. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often branched.</p>
<p>Despite its bitterness, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of natural latex.</p>
