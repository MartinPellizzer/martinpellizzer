<p>Cyphostemma feddeanum is a rare and fascinating plant native to southern Africa. It is known for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions. This species belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is often referred to as the "devil's backbone" due to its distinctive spiny stems. Its striking yellow flowers make it a sought-after addition to botanical collections. Despite its beauty, it remains a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
