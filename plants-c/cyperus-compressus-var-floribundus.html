                    <h1>Cyperus compressus var. floribundus</h1>
<p>Cyperus compressus var. floribundus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or reddish in color, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological pioneer and a potential weed in aquatic habitats.</p>
