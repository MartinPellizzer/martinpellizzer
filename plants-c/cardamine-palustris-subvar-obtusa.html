                    <h1>Cardamine palustris subvar. obtusa</h1>
<p>Cardamine palustris subvar. obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf water-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can access the moisture it requires. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, edible seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
