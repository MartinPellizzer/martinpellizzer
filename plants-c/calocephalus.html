                    <h1>Calocephalus</h1>
<p>Calocephalus, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either linear or lance-shaped, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Calocephalus species are often found in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their distinctive seed heads, which resemble those of true dandelions but are less showy.</p>
