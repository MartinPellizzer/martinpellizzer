                    <h1>Calothamnus lateralis var. crassus</h1>
<p>Calothamnus lateralis var. crassus, commonly known as the broad-leafed emu bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces showy, red or orange floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
