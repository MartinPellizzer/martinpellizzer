                    <h1>Coniogramme lancangensis</h1>
<p>Coniogramme lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang Coniogramme, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Coniogramme lancangensis remains a poorly understood species in the botanical world.</p>
