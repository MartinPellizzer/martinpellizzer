                    <h1>Cyathula deserti</h1>
<p>Cyathula deserti, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing minimal forage for wildlife.</p>
