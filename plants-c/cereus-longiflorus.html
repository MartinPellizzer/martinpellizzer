<p>Cereus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The cactus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
