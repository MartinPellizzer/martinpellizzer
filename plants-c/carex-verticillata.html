                    <h1>Carex verticillata</h1>
<p>Carex verticillata, commonly known as the flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Carex verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
