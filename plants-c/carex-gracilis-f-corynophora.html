                    <h1>Carex gracilis f. corynophora</h1>
<p>Carex gracilis f. corynophora, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a variant of the slender sedges, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest understories. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex gracilis f. corynophora is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local biodiversity.</p>
