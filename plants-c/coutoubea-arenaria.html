                    <h1>Coutoubea arenaria</h1>
<p>Coutoubea arenaria, commonly known as the sand coutoubea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coutoubea arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
