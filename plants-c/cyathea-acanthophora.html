<p>Cyathea acanthophora, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are released into the air for reproduction. Cyathea acanthophora thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
