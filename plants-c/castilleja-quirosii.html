<p>Castilleja quirosii, commonly known as the Quir√≥s's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Castilleja quirosii plays a role in pollination by attracting various insects, including bees and butterflies.</p>
