<p>Chimaphila dasystemma, commonly known as the Florida ghostflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with distinctive white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
