<p>Cordia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Cordia tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>
