<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture, and it produces small, spiny acorns that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
