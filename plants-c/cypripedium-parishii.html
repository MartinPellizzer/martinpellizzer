                    <h1>Cypripedium parishii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium parishii, commonly known as the Parry's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a pale yellow or white lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypripedium parishii is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
