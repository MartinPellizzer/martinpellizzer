                    <h1>Coilonox diluculum</h1>
<p>Coilonox diluculum, commonly known as the dawn's breath fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds that unfurl gradually throughout the day, responding to light and humidity. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its spores are released in the early morning, coinciding with the first light of day, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
