<p>Cordiglottis major, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features long, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with abundant sunlight and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Cordiglottis major plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
