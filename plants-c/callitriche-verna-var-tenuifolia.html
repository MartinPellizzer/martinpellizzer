                    <h1>Callitriche verna var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Callitriche verna var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender spring pondweed, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem, which helps it float or rest on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often with four to six petals, and it produces small, oval fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
