                            <h1>California Macrophylla</h1>
<p>California poppy, scientifically known as California macrophylla, is the state flower of California and a symbol of the region's natural beauty. This iconic plant is native to the western United States, particularly thriving in the dry, sunny climates of the California coast. With its vibrant orange petals and delicate, feathery leaves, it is easily recognizable and widely admired. The California poppy is also known for its resilience, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its simple yet striking appearance has made it a popular subject in art, literature, and environmental conservation efforts.</p>
