                    <h1>Cynometra filifera</h1>
<p>Cynometra filifera, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, savanna-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited seed dispersal, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
