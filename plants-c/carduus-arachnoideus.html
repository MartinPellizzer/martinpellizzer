                    <h1>Carduus arachnoideus</h1>
<p>Carduus arachnoideus, commonly known as the spider-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and a distinctive, spiky flower head that resembles a thistle. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bristly, prickly seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
