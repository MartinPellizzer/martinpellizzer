<p>Cylindropuntia imbricata subsp.</p>
<p>argentea, commonly known as silver cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are covered in small, spiny segments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The silver-blue coloration of its stems is due to a dense covering of fine hairs that reflect sunlight.</p>
