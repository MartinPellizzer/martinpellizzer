                    <h1>Copernicia brittonorum var. acuta</h1>
<p>Copernicia brittonorum var. acuta, commonly known as the Acute Copernicia palm, is a rare and distinctive palm species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, edible fruits that are a source of nutrition for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
