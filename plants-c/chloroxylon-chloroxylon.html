<p>Chloroxylon chloroxylon, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
