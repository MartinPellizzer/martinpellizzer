                    <h1>Cyclosorus paucipinnus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus paucipinnus, commonly known as the sparse-pinnate water clover, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds that grow from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy substrates, often in shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
