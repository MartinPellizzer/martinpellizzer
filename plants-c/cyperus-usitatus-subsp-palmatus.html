<p>Cyperus usitatus subsp.</p>
<p>palmatus, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
