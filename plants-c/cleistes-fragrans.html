<p>Cleistes fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant cleistocarp, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed until they mature. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that emit a sweet, spicy fragrance, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleistes fragrans is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
