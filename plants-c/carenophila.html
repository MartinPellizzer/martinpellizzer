<p>Carenophila, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its most striking feature is the cluster of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. The plant has a shallow root system and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
