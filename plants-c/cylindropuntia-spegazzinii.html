                    <h1>Cylindropuntia spegazzinii</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's barrel cactus, is a species native to the deserts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
