                    <h1>Cuscuta maroccana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North Africa and thrives in arid environments. It is often found parasitizing crops and shrubs, which can lead to reduced growth in its host.</p>
<p>Cuscuta maroccana is an example of a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from another plant.</p>
