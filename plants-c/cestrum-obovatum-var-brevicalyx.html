                    <h1>Cestrum obovatum var. brevicalyx</h1>
<p>Cestrum obovatum var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Cestrum obovatum. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically orange or red when ripe.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
