<p>Ceratoschoenus macrostachys var. patulus, commonly known as the broad-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in saturated soils and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The variety patulus is distinguished by its broader staminal filaments compared to the typical form.</p>
