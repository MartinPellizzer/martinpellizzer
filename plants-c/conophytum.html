                    <h1>Conophytum</h1>
<p>Conophytum, commonly known as the "living stones," is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps minimize water loss through evaporation. Conophytum species produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, usually during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh conditions make them popular among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
