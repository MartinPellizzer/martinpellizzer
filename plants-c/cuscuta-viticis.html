                    <h1>Cuscuta viticis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta viticis, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts. It is commonly found on grapevines and other plants in the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
