                    <h1>Callitriche palustris</h1>
<p>Callitriche palustris, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It features tiny, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom from June to September, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It is often found in still or gently flowing water, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>Callitriche palustris plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
