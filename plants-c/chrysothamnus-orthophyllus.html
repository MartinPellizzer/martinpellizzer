<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silvery-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The golden sagebrush plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
