<p>Cyclosorus jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
