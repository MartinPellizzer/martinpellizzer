                    <h1>Calycothrix oldfieldii</h1>
<p>Calycothrix oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's corymbiferous, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Calycothrix oldfieldii is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
