                    <h1>Cladium samoense var. unisetum</h1>
<p>Cladium samoense var. unisetum, commonly known as the Samoan sawgrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Samoa and nearby islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its flowering spikes are relatively small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
