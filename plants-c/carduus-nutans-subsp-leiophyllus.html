<p>Carduus nutans subsp.</p>
<p>leiophyllus, commonly known as the softleaf musk thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pale green to bluish-gray leaves that are typically softer and more lobed than those of the typical Carduus nutans.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, globe-shaped seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
