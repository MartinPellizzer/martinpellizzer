                    <h1>Caralluma retrospiciens var. acutangula</h1>
<p>Caralluma retrospiciens var. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-angled prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with spiny, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
