                    <h1>Cypripedium × gaskellianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × gaskellianum, commonly known as the Gaskell's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
