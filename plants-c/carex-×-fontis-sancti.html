<p>Carex × fontis-sancti, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Carex fontana and Carex sancta, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and often forms clumps with a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows, where it thrives in full to partial shade. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps prevent water loss.</p>
<p>The flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, which are often pollinated by wind.</p>
