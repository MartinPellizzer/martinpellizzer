                    <h1>Cirsium × erisithaliforme</h1>
<p>Cirsium × erisithaliforme, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (common thistle), resulting in a plant with a complex genetic makeup. The species is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
