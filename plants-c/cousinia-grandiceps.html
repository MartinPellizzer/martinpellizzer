                    <h1>Cousinia grandiceps</h1>
<p>Cousinia grandiceps, commonly known as the giant cushion cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Cousinia grandiceps is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
