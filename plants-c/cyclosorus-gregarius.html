                    <h1>Cyclosorus gregarius</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus gregarius, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy, greenish appearance, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Cyclosorus gregarius reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
