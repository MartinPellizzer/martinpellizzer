                    <h1>Cyclosorus medogensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, pinnately divided leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus medogensis is considered an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems.</p>
