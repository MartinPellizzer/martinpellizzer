                    <h1>Cornopteris tsangii</h1>
<p>Cornopteris tsangii, commonly known as the Tsaung's water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and pools. The plant features delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, contributing to its elusive nature.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Cornopteris tsangii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
