                    <h1>Cyperus rigens var. maximus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rigens var. maximus, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a tall, grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and establish dense stands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both a common weed in agricultural settings and an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
