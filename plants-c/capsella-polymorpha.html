<p>Capsella polymorpha, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval or spoon-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Capsella polymorpha is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens, where it can become a weed due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production.</p>
