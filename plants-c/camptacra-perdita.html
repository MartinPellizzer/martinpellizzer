<p>Camptacra perdita, commonly known as the lost spreading camptacra, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring or early summer. Camptacra perdita thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
