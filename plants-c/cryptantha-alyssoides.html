<p>Cryptantha alyssoides, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, rounded leaves are arranged in pairs, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Cryptantha alyssoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
