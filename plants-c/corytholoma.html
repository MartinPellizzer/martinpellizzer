                    <h1>Corytholoma</h1>
<p>Corytholoma, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a type of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a central, horn-like structure called a corymbe. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, typically an ascomycete. Corytholoma is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
