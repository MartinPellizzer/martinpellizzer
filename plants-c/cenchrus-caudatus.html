                    <h1>Cenchrus caudatus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus caudatus, commonly known as the burrcanary grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and distinctive, hairy, bristle-like structures at the tips of its seed heads. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in stiff, barbed bristles, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Cenchrus caudatus is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop in certain regions.</p>
