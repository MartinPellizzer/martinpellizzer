<p>Cypripedium lichiangense subsp.</p>
<p>lentiginosum, commonly known as the spotted lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pinkish-brown lip that features dark, velvety spots.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cool, shaded habitats with moist, well-drained soil, often in forest understories. It has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and several pseudobulbs that support its flowering cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and over-collection.</p>
