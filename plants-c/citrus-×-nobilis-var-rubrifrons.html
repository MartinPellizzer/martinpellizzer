                    <h1>Citrus × nobilis var. rubrifrons</h1>
<p>Citrus × nobilis var. rubrifrons, commonly known as the blood orange, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its distinctive deep red or crimson pigmentation in its flesh and rind.</p>
<p>This variety belongs to the Rutaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Italy. The fruit's unique coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are more pronounced in cooler climates. Blood oranges are typically smaller than common oranges and have a slightly tart, sweet flavor.</p>
<p>They are valued not only for their culinary uses but also for their ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
