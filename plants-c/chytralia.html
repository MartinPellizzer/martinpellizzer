The plant's botanical structure includes a short stem with a single umbel of flowers, each consisting of three sepals and three petals. Chytralia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
