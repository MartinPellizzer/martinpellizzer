<p>Cyclosorus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
