                    <h1>Carex arenaria f. remota</h1>
<p>Carex arenaria f. remota, commonly known as the remote sand sedge, is a rare and specialized plant species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
