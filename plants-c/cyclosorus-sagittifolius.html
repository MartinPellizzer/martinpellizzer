                    <h1>Cyclosorus sagittifolius</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus sagittifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arrow-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
