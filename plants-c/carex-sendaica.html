Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Carex sendaica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
