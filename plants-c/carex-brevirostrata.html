<p>Carex brevirostrata, commonly known as the short-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex brevirostrata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
