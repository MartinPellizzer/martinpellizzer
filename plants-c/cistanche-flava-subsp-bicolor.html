<p>Cistanche flava subsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the yellow parasitic herb, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Native to arid regions of China, it thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert environments. The plant has distinctive yellow to orange-red flowers and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant ecology and medicinal botany.</p>
