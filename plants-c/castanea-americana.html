                    <h1>Castanea americana</h1>
<p>Castanea americana, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces spiny, spherical fruits called chestnuts, which contain one to three edible seeds. It was once a dominant species in eastern forests but was nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to restore its population through breeding programs and genetic resistance research.</p>
