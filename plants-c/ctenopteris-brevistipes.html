                    <h1>Ctenopteris brevistipes</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris brevistipes, commonly known as the short-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dicksoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compact,丛生 growth habit and distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a waxy coating. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
