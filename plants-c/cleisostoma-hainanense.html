                    <h1>Cleisostoma hainanense</h1>
<p>Cleisostoma hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan cleistostoma, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in high-altitude forests. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are enclosed within a hood-like structure called a cleistogamous capsule, a unique reproductive feature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
