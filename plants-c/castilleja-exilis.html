                    <h1>Castilleja exilis</h1>
<p>Castilleja exilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja exilis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as host plants for certain insects.</p>
