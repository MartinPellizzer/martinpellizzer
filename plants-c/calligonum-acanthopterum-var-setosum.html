                    <h1>Calligonum acanthopterum var. setosum</h1>
<p>Calligonum acanthopterum var. setosum, commonly known as the hairy calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, often spiny foliage. The leaves are typically small, linear, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or green.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for revegetation projects in degraded landscapes due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
