                    <h1>Calea palmeri</h1>
<p>Calea palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's candleplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Calea palmeri is often found in desert scrub and rocky areas, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>
