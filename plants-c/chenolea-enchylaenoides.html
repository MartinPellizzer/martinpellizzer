<p>Chenolea enchylaenoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
