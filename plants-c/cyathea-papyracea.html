<p>Cyathea papyracea, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, papery sheath that peels away as the plant matures. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea papyracea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
