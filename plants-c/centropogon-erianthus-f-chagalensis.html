<p>Centropogon erianthus f. chagalensis, commonly known as the Chagal√©n chamaedorea, is a rare and endemic fern species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its unique morphological features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
