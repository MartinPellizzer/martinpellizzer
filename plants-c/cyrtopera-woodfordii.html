                    <h1>Cyrtopera woodfordii</h1>
<p>Cyrtopera woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a gymnosperm, adapted to survive in specific ecological niches.</p>
