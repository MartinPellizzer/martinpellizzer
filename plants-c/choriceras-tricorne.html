<p>Choriceras tricorne, commonly known as the tricorne horned lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Cladoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a central stem and lateral branches that often form a tricorne or three-lobed shape. The lichen typically grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate and subpolar regions. It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health.</p>
