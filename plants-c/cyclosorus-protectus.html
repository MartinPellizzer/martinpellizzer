<p>Cyclosorus protectus, commonly known as the protected cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging from the water surface in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus protectus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
