                    <h1>Commiphora kaokoensis</h1>
<p>Commiphora kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko myrrh tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Namib Desert of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant that produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its survival in such harsh environments highlights its resilience and unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
