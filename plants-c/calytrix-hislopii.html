<p>Calytrix hislopii, commonly known as the coastal calytrix, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Calytrix hislopii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
