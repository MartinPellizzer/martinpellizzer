<p>Campanula atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its rocky habitat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, limestone-rich soils. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile ecosystem, Campanula atlantis is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
