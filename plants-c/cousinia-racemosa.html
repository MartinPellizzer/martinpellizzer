                    <h1>Cousinia racemosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia racemosa, commonly known as the flowering spurge or desert fleabane, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia racemosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
