                    <h1>Cotema woodfredensis</h1>
<p>Cotema woodfredensis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes a sympodial growth pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cotema woodfredensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
