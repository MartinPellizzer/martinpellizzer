                    <h1>Cypripedium bullenianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium bullenianum, commonly known as the Bullen's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the center. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cypripedium bullenianum is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
