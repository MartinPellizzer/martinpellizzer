                    <h1>Chthonocephalus oldfieldianus</h1>
<p>Chthonocephalus oldfieldianus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are white or pale green, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
