                    <h1>Campanula elatines var. fenestrellata</h1>
<p>Campanula elatines var. fenestrellata, commonly known as the fenestrated bellflower, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in damp environments. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf fenestrations, or leaf holes, which give it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value.</p>
