<p>Culcitium neaei, commonly known as the Neaei's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to a specific region in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Culcitium neaei is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
