                    <h1>Cuscuta grandiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta grandiflora, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, yellowish stem covered in tiny, adhesive pads that help it attach to its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on crops like corn and beans. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host plant and then developing a complex network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta grandiflora plays a role in ecological interactions and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
