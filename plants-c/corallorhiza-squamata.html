<p>Corallorhiza squamata, commonly known as the squamata beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces tall, slender stems with whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, scaly texture. Its flowers are typically pink to reddish-purple, with five petals and a distinctive hooded labellum.</p>
<p>Corallorhiza squamata thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
