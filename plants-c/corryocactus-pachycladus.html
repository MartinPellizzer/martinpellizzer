<p>Corryocactus pachycladus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a unique cactus native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in dense, pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
