                    <h1>Cystopteris leptophylla</h1>
<p>Cystopteris leptophylla, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodiales fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
