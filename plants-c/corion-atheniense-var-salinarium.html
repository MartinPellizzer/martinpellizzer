                    <h1>Corion atheniense var. salinarium</h1>
<p>Corion atheniense var. salinarium, commonly known as the salt marsh corion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, demonstrating a high tolerance for both salt and drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
