<p>Criciuma asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric cricium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical floral structure, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink, are highly ornamental and attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to habitat destruction, Criciuma asymmetrica is considered an endangered species.</p>
