                    <h1>Crataegus lindenii</h1>
<p>Crataegus lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but generally not for humans. Crataegus lindenii is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticulture and ecological studies.</p>
