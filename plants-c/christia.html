                    <h1>Christia</h1>
<p>Christia, commonly known as the "cottonwood" or "kapok" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their showy, often pink or red, pea-like flowers. The leaves are typically compound, with several small leaflets arranged along a central stem. Christia species produce long, cylindrical pods that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important component of many ecosystems.</p>
