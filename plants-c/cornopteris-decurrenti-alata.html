                    <h1>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata</h1>
<p>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the decurrent-alate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The leaves are usually deciduous, with a distinctive decurrent (gradually tapering) shape and a finely divided, almost feather-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the fern life cycle.</p>
