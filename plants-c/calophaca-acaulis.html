                    <h1>Calophaca acaulis</h1>
<p>Calophaca acaulis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a small, perennial flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lack of a distinct stem, with all leaves arising directly from the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and Mediterranean climates.</p>
