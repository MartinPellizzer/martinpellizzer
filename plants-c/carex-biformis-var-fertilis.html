                    <h1>Carex biformis var. fertilis</h1>
<p>Carex biformis var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertilis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
