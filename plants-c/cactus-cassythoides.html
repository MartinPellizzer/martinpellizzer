                    <h1>Cactus cassythoides</h1>
<p>Cactus cassythoides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to the desert landscape. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus cassythoides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky soils and sandy plains.</p>
