<p>Carex orbicularis subsp.</p>
<p>orbicularis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with oval, often reddish-brown leaves that are broader than they are long.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
