                    <h1>Cheilanthes lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive silvery appearance due to the fine pubescence.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and is often used in rockeries due to its drought tolerance.</p>
