                    <h1>Caralluma rangeana</h1>
<p>Caralluma rangeana, commonly known as the Indian figleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into flattened stems, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma rangeana is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
