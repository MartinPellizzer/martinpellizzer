                    <h1>Cuscuta capitata var. varzobica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta capitata var. varzobica, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
