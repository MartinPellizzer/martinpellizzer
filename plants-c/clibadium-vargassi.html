<p>Clibadium vargassi, commonly known as the Brazilian burr or the devil's claw, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a tough, burs-like structure. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are alternate and simple, with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>The fruit's unique morphology aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals.</p>
