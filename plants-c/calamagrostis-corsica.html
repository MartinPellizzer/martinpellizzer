<p>Calamagrostis corsica, commonly known as the Corsican reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
