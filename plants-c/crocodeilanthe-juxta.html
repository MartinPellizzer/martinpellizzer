<p>Crocodeilanthe juxta, commonly known as the close-growing fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, linear fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical profile.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Crocodeilanthe juxta is considered a specialty plant for advanced botanical enthusiasts.</p>
