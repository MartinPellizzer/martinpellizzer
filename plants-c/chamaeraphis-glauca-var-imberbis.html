                    <h1>Chamaeraphis glauca var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis glauca var. imberbis, commonly known as sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora.</p>
