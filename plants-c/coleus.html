                    <h1>Coleus</h1>
<p>Coleus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves rather than its small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Its foliage comes in a wide range of colors, including red, purple, pink, and green, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
