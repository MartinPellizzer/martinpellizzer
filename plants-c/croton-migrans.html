                    <h1>Croton migrans</h1>
<p>Croton migrans, commonly known as the wandering croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be elliptic, ovate, or even triangular in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its adaptability to different soil types and light conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
