                    <h1>Corybas abditus</h1>
<p>Corybas abditus, commonly known as the hidden corymb, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the montane rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flower that is often camouflaged among the leaf litter, making it difficult to spot. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its flowers are usually dark red or purple, with a prominent, hood-like labellum that serves as a pollinator trap.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and restricted habitat, Corybas abditus is considered a rare and poorly understood species in the orchid family.</p>
