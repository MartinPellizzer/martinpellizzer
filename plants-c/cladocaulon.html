<p>It is typically found growing on rock surfaces, especially in humid and shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of the fungal and algal components. Cladocaulon exhibits a variety of growth forms, including crustose, foliose, and fructicose, depending on the species.</p>
