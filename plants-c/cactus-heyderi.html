                    <h1>Cactus heyderi</h1>
<p>Cactus heyderi, commonly known as the Heyder's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections.</p>
