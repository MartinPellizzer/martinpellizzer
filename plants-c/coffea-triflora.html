                    <h1>Coffea triflora</h1>
<p>Coffea triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coffea triflora is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee species.</p>
