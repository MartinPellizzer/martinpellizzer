                    <h1>Cuscuta gymnocarpa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seeded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, yellow-orange stem covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant's seeds are enclosed in a smooth, capsule-like structure, which is a distinguishing feature of its reproductive system. It is native to various regions of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and other plants it infests.</p>
