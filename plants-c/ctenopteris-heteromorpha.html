                <h1>Ctenopteris heteromorpha</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris heteromorpha, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments of varying shapes and sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
