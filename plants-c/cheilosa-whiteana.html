                    <h1>Cheilosa whiteana</h1>
<p>Cheilosa whiteana, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
