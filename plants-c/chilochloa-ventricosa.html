<p>Chilochloa ventricosa, commonly known as the mountain grass or hill grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range.</p>
