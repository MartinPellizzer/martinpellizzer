<p>Cymatoptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow and are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Cymatoptera species are often considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
