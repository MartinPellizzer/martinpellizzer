                            <h1>Cerastium Vulgatum Var. Brachypetalum</h1>
<p>Mouse-ear chickweed, scientifically known as Cerastium vulgatum var. brachypetalum, is a low-growing flowering plant commonly found in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and delicate white flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in meadows, gardens, and along pathways. Its name derives from the shape of its leaves, which resemble tiny mouse ears. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
