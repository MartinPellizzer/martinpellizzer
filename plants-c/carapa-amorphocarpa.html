<p>Carapa amorphocarpa, commonly known as the Amazonian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and fissured.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
