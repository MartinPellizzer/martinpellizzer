The plant exhibits a preference for moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest regions. Its reproductive structures are highly adapted for wind pollination, with small, inconspicuous flowers that produce lightweight pollen.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
