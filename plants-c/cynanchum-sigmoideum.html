<p>Cynanchum sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
