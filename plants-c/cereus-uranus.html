                    <h1>Cereus uranus</h1>
<p>Cereus uranus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a striking plant with a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid of two different cactus species, combining the vibrant colors of the Hylocereus genus with the hardy root system of the Cereus genus. The plant features a swollen, segmented stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically appear at night, adding to its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful watering and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
