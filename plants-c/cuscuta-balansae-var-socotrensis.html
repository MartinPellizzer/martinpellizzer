                    <h1>Cuscuta balansae var. socotrensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta balansae var. socotrensis, commonly known as the Socotra dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Socotra Island.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is adapted to arid environments and exhibits rapid growth when it comes into contact with a suitable host.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant biology.</p>
