<p>Ctenitis crinigera, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaves.</p>
