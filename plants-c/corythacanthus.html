                    <h1>Corythacanthus</h1>
<p>Corythacanthus, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a rare and ancient genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and distinctive, cup-like leaf shapes that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are prominently displayed and contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Corythacanthus is of particular interest to botanists studying bryophyte evolution.</p>
