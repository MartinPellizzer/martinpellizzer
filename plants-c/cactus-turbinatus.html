                    <h1>Cactus turbinatus</h1>
<p>Cactus turbinatus, commonly known as the turbinated cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary response to harsh desert environments.</p>
