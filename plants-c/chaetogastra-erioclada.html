<p>Chaetogastra erioclada, commonly known as the hairy-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
