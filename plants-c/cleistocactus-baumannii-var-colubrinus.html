                    <h1>Cleistocactus baumannii var. colubrinus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus baumannii var. colubrinus, commonly known as the blue barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically blue-green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
