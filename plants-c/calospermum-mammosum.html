<p>Calospermum mammosum, commonly known as the milkweed or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, thanks to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>Calospermum mammosum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
