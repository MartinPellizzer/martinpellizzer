                    <h1>Calorchis</h1>
<p>Calorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Calorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
