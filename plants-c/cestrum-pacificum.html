<p>Cestrum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
