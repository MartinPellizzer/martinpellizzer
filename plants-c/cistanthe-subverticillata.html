                    <h1>Cistanthe subverticillata</h1>
<p>Cistanthe subverticillata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with silver-green, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that release seeds when disturbed. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cistanthe subverticillata is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
