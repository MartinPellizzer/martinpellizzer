<p>Comarum palustre var. subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular marsh crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that typically grow up to 30 cm in height, often emerging from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster at the top of the stems. Its leaves are basal, floating, and oval-shaped with a waxy coating, adapted for survival in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular dots on its leaves and stems, which give it its specific name.</p>
