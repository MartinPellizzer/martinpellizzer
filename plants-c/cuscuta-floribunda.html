                    <h1>Cuscuta floribunda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta floribunda, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species, including crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta floribunda is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive nature and potential to reduce crop yields.</p>
