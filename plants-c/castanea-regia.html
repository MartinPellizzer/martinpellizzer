<p>Castanea regia, commonly known as the royal chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits containing one or two edible nuts. Its nuts are encased in a thick, spiky husk and are typically harvested in the fall.</p>
<p>Castanea regia is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>
