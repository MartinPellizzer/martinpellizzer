                    <h1>Corytoplectus pulcher</h1>
<p>Corytoplectus pulcher, commonly known as the beautiful sand dollar, is a species of sea urchin belonging to the family Clypeasteridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-like body covered in a calcareous skeleton with a unique pattern of pores and spines. The plant, or rather the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in sandy substrates where it burrows to feed on organic matter. Its skeletal structure is often used by marine life for shelter and is an important component of benthic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its role in sediment stabilization and nutrient cycling in marine environments.</p>
