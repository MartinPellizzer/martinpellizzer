                    <h1>Corysanthes saprophytica</h1>
<p>Corysanthes saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and relies on specific host trees for support. The plant is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and its unique, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is adapted to low-light conditions and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Corysanthes saprophytica is considered critically endangered.</p>
