<p>Calliandra quadrangularis, commonly known as the square-leaved calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers in racemes, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening and erosion control.</p>
<p>Calliandra quadrangularis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility.</p>
