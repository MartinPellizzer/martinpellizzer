                    <h1>Coffea dewevrei var. zenkeri</h1>
<p>Coffea dewevrei var. zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's coffee, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and Gabon. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
