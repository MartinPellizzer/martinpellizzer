                    <h1>Ctenitis crystallina</h1>
<p>Ctenitis crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with tiny, translucent crystals on the undersides of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive branching pattern that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its tissues is a notable botanical feature that can affect its handling and care.</p>
