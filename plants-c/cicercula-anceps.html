<p>Cicercula anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
<p>Cicercula anceps is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
