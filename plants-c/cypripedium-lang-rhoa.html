                    <h1>Cypripedium lang-rhoa</h1>
<p>Cypripedium lang-rhoa, commonly known as the Lang Rao lady's slipper, is a rare and beautiful orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature common among orchids of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a single, prominent spur that extends from the base of the flower.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium lang-rhoa is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
