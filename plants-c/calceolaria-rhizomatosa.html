<p>Calceolaria rhizomatosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf calceolaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like petals that resemble small cups, which give it its genus name "Calceolaria," meaning "little shoe.". The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers, which come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Calceolaria rhizomatosa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
