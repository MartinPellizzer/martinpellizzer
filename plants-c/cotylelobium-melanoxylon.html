<p>Cotylelobium melanoxylon, commonly known as the black ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and construction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
