                            <h1>Calophyllum Miquelii</h1>
<p>Calophyllum miquelii is a rare and striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. Known for its large, palm-like leaves and showy yellow flowers, it is a member of the Calophyllaceae family. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique appearance makes it a prized specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists. Due to habitat loss, Calophyllum miquelii is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
