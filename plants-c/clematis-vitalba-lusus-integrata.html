<p>Clematis vitalba lusus integrata, commonly known as the European Clematis or Virgin's Bower, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinctive central cluster of stamens. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed carefully.</p>
