                    <h1>Cereus ruber</h1>
<p>Cereus ruber, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often reddish in color, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to desert conditions, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
