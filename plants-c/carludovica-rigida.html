<p>Carludovica rigida, commonly known as the rigid cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines, which help to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
