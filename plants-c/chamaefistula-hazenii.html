                    <h1>Chamaefistula hazenii</h1>
<p>Chamaefistula hazenii, commonly known as the Hazen's thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its prickly nature, but it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
