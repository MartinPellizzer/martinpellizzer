<p>Crucianella squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy sea bean, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Crucianella squarrosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
