<p>Ctenopteris merrittii, commonly known as the Merritt's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it can anchor itself to vertical surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris merrittii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings.</p>
