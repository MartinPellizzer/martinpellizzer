<p>Cystopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the family Pellaeaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are typically divided into small, delicate pinnae, which help in maximizing light absorption.</p>
<p>Cystopteris gigantea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
