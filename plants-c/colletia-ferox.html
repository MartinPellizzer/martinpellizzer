<p>Colletia ferox, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Colletia ferox is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
