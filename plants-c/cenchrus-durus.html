                    <h1>Cenchrus durus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus durus, commonly known as the hard panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus durus is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock in dry environments.</p>
