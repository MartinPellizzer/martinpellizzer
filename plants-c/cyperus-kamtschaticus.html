<p>Cyperus kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Kamtschatic grass, is a perennial sedge native to regions of Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually green or brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth pattern, which allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Cyperus kamtschaticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
