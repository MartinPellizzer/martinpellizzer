                    <h1>Cuscuta parviflora var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta parviflora var. parviflora, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through fragmentation of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants.</p>
