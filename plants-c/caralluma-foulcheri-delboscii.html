                    <h1>Caralluma foulcheri-delboscii</h1>
<p>Caralluma foulcheri-delboscii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, showy flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers, often white or pale purple, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
