<p>Carex vesicata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Carex vesicata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
