                    <h1>Coleobotrys maxwelliana</h1>
<p>Coleobotrys maxwelliana, commonly known as Maxwell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a short, tuberous rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
