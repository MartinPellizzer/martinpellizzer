                    <h1>Chaerophyllum palustre</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum palustre, commonly known as marsh parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and damp meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
