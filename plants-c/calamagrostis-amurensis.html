                    <h1>Calamagrostis amurensis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis amurensis, commonly known as the Amur reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a valuable species for erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen.</p>
