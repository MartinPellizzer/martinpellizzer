<p>Calligonum alatum, commonly known as the winged saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive winged branches and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Calligonum alatum is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
