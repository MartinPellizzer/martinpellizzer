<p>Cycas rumphii subsp.</p>
<p>normanbyana, commonly known as the Normanby's cycad, is a species of cycad native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
