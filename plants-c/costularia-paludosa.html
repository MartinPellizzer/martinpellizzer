                    <h1>Costularia paludosa</h1>
<p>Costularia paludosa, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Costularia paludosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
