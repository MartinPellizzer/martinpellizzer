                    <h1>Cephalanthera rubra f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera rubra f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf red helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive red lip, which are borne on slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
