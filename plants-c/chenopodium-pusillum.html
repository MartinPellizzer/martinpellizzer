                    <h1>Chenopodium pusillum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium pusillum, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Chenopodium pusillum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
