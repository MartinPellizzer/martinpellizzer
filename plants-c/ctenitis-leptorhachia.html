                    <h1>Ctenitis leptorhachia</h1>
<p>Ctenitis leptorhachia, commonly known as the narrow-veined sea holly, is a rare and delicate marine plant found in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, translucent film. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish waters and is adapted to withstand tidal fluctuations and salt spray. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
