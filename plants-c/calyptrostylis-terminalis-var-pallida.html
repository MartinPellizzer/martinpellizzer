                    <h1>Calyptrostylis terminalis var. pallida</h1>
<p>Calyptrostylis terminalis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective shield called a indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its pale, almost white spores, which contribute to its unique botanical identity.</p>
