                    <h1>Crepidomanes schmidianum var. latifrons</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes schmidianum var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited rockmoss, is a member of the Pottiaceae family, characterized by its small, rosette-forming structure.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader fronds compared to other varieties within the same species.</p>
