                    <h1>Cephalophyllum acutum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-tipped cephalophyllum, is a unique succulent native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its growth pattern is compact, with a low profile that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
