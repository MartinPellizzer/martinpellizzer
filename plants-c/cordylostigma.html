                    <h1>Cordylostigma</h1>
<p>Cordylostigma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on specific types of trees for nutrients. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cordylostigma is considered critically endangered in many regions.</p>
