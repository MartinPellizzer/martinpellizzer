<p>Cotyledon africana, commonly known as the African Sunset or African Ice Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cotyledon africana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
