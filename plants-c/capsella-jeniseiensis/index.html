                            <h1>Capsella Jeniseiensis</h1>
<p>Capsella jeniseiensis is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. This species is known for its striking blue-violet flowers and small, rounded leaves. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Studying Capsella jeniseiensis offers insights into plant adaptation and biodiversity in extreme environments.</p>
