<p>Calonemorchis heberleana, commonly known as the Heberlean's calonemorchis, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid genera. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a striking contrast between the pale greenish-white petals and the deep violet or purple sepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
