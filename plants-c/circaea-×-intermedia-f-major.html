<p>Circaea × intermedia f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved sandwort, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and ecological adaptation.</p>
