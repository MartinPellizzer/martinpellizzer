                    <h1>Chryseis compacta</h1>
<p>Chryseis compacta, commonly known as the golden compact fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-like growth pattern with tightly packed, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or shaded garden settings.</p>
