                    <h1>Clidemia anisophylla</h1>
<p>Clidemia anisophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, through its haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Clidemia anisophylla plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both its host trees and the animals that interact with it.</p>
