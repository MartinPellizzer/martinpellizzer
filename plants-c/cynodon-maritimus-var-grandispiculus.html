<p>Cynodon maritimus var. grandispiculus, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used for erosion control in coastal environments due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
