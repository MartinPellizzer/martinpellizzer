                    <h1>Coilonox unifoliatum</h1>
<p>Coilonox unifoliatum, commonly known as the single-leaf coilonox, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its singular, broad, waxy leaf that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a water-retaining structure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom once a year, typically during the dry season. Its root system is shallow but highly adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Coilonox unifoliatum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
