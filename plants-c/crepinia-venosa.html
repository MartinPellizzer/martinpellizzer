                    <h1>Crepinia venosa</h1>
<p>Crepinia venosa, commonly known as the slender river lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water's surface. Its root system is adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Crepinia venosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
