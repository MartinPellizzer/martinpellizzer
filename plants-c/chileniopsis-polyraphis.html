                    <h1>Chileniopsis polyraphis</h1>
<p>Chileniopsis polyraphis, commonly known as the Chilean feather cactus, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
