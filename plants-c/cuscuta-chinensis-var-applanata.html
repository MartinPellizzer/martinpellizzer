                    <h1>Cuscuta chinensis var. applanata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta chinensis var. applanata, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to establish connections. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found parasitizing crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
