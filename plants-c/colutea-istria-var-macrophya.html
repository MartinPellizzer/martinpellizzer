                    <h1>Colutea istria var. macrophya</h1>
<p>Colutea istria var. macrophya, commonly known as the large-seeded broomrape, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and its leaves are small and often reduced. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The seeds of this species are adapted for dispersal by animals, contributing to its ecological role in certain habitats.</p>
