                    <h1>Cytisus hispidus</h1>
<p>Cytisus hispidus, commonly known as the rough broom, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are small, alternate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its "hispidus" name, which means "hairy" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
