                    <h1>Chamaesyce harmandii</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce harmandii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats.</p>
