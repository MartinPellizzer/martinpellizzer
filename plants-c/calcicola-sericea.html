                    <h1>Calcicola sericea</h1>
<p>Calcicola sericea, commonly known as the silky calcicola, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, often arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Calcicola sericea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
