                    <h1>Cephalorhizum pachycormum</h1>
<p>Cephalorhizum pachycormum, commonly known as the broad-cormed headroot, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, swollen corms that store nutrients for survival in harsh mountain environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to retain moisture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
