<p>Clausospicula, commonly known as the "spiny bladderwort," is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in floating. They typically grow in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures that help in anchoring the plant.</p>
<p>Clausospicula is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic life, including its specialized reproductive structures.</p>
