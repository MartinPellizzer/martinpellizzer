                    <h1>Coffea biflora</h1>
<p>Coffea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are clustered in pairs, giving it its scientific name. Its fruit, known as a berry, contains two seeds, which are used to make coffee.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coffea biflora is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to other coffee plants.</p>
