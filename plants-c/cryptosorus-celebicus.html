<p>Cryptosorus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes cryptosorus, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
