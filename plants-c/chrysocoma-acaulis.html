                    <h1>Chrysocoma acaulis</h1>
<p>Chrysocoma acaulis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and dense, evergreen foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its ability to thrive in rocky soils makes it well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Chrysocoma acaulis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
