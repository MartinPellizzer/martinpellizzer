                    <h1>Ceratozamia oliversacksii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia oliversacksii, commonly known as the Oliver's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the trunk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
