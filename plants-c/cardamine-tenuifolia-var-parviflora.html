                    <h1>Cardamine tenuifolia var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Cardamine tenuifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are often fibrous and adapted for nutrient uptake from waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its culinary use in some regions, though it is often confused with other similar species due to its subtle appearance.</p>
