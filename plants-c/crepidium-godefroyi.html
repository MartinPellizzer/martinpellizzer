                    <h1>Crepidium godefroyi</h1>
<p>Crepidium godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often harsh, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it prefers cool, shaded habitats with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
