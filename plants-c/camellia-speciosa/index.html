<p>Camellia speciosa is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern China and Southeast Asia.

The plant features glossy dark green leaves and can grow up to 10 feet tall in ideal conditions. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Camellia speciosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its long-lasting blooms.</p>
