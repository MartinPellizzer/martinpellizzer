                    <h1>Calcearia saprophytica</h1>
<p>Calcearia saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calcearia saprophytica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
