<p>Croton crispatus, commonly known as the rough croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often crinkled leaves, which give it its scientific name "crispatus," meaning "crisp" or "brittle.". The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
