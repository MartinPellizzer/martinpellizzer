<p>Cardamine bulbifera f. ptarmicifolia, commonly known as the ptarmicifolia buttercup, is a rare fern-like plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique feature is the production of bulbils, which are small plantlets that develop on the stem, aiding in vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
