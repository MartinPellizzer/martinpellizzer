                    <h1>Cousinia sagittata</h1>
<p>Cousinia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, arrow-shaped leaves and produces tall, branched stems with clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in steppe and desert habitats. It has hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Cousinia sagittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
