                    <h1>Conyza chenopodioides</h1>
<p>Conyza chenopodioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Sandmat is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
