<p>Cerastium × triculinum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
