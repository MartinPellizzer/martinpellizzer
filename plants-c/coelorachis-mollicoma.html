<p>Coelorachis mollicoma, commonly known as the soft-hair fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Coelorachis mollicoma plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
