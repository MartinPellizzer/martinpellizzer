                    <h1>Chytroma labriculata</h1>
<p>Chytroma labriculata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, where it forms a crust-like growth on stone surfaces. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, foliose thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
