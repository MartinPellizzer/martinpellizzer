<p>Convolvulus asclepiadeus, commonly known as the Crown Vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and deep root system.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
