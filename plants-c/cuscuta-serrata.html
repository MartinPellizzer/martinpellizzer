                    <h1>Cuscuta serrata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta serrata, commonly known as the serrated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems and leaves. The plant attaches itself to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Cuscuta serrata is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the feces of animals that consume its host plants.</p>
