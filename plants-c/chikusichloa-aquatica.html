<p>Chikusichloa aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
