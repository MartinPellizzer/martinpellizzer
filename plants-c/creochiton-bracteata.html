<p>Creochiton bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate pill bug, is a species of isopod belonging to the family Porcellanidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented, oval body covered in a hard exoskeleton, which provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. This species typically inhabits moist, shaded environments such as leaf litter or under rocks, where it can maintain the necessary humidity for survival. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its body and the presence of bracts on its segments give it its common name.</p>
