<p>Carya alba var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The tree produces alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>The oval hickory is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats.</p>
