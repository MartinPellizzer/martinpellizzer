                            <h1>Castanopsis Cuspidata F. Serratifolia</h1>
<p>Japanese tanoak, scientifically known as Castanopsis cuspidata f. serratifolia, is a unique evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Japan. This plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, spiny leaves that give it a rugged appearance. Thriving in humid, temperate climates, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Despite its hardy nature, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Its ecological significance and ornamental value make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
