                    <h1>Cynometra claessensii</h1>
<p>Cynometra claessensii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, globose fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
