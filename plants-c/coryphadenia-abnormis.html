                    <h1>Coryphadenia abnormis</h1>
<p>Coryphadenia abnormis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
