<p>Chenopodina asphaltica, commonly known as the asphaltic goosefoot, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically in shades of green or red. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-arid regions.</p>
