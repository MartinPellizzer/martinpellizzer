                    <h1>Calamina</h1>
<p>Calamina, commonly known as zinc oxide, is a mineral compound primarily composed of zinc carbonate.</p>
<p>It is not a plant but a mineral used in various applications, including medicinal and industrial uses. While it is not a botanical entity, it is often found in the earth and can be mined for its properties. In some contexts, the term "calamina" may be confused with plants, but it has no direct botanical relation.</p>
<p>Its use in skincare and as a drying agent is more relevant to chemistry than botany.</p>
