                    <h1>Carex bastardiana</h1>
<p>Carex bastardiana, commonly known as the bastard sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>Carex bastardiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
