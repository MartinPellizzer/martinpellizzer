                    <h1>Carolus dukei</h1>
<p>Carolus dukei, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, creating a dramatic visual impact in gardens. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Carolus dukei is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ability to provide habitat for various small wildlife species.</p>
