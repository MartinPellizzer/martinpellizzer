<p>Chelonanthus camporum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Chelonanthus camporum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for small wildlife.</p>
