                    <h1>Corrigiola littorea</h1>
<p>Corrigiola littorea, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a small flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is commonly found in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Corrigiola littorea is a hardy species that is well-adapted to the harsh conditions of the intertidal zone.</p>
