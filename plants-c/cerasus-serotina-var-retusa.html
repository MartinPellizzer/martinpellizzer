<p>Cerasus serotina var. retusa, commonly known as the late cherry or late sweet cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its relatively late blooming period, which typically occurs after most other cherry varieties, hence its common name. The plant produces small, dark red to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are prized for their flavor and juiciness.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety include its slender, branched shrub or small tree form and its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
