                    <h1>Cypripedium venustum var. measuresianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium venustum var. measuresianum, commonly known as the Meares' lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit, with a single, upright stem that bears a single flower. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
