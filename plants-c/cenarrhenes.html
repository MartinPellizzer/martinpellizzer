<p>Cenarrhenes, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in dense, golden-yellow spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
