                    <h1>Chorizanthe stellulata</h1>
<p>Chorizanthe stellulata, commonly known as the starry choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Chorizanthe stellulata is an important component of desert ecosystems and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
