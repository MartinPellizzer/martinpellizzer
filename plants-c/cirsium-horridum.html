<p>Cirsium horridum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and open woodlands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
