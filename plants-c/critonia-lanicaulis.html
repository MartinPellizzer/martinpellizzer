<p>Critonia lanicaulis, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fungal hyphae and algal cells. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive on rocky surfaces in arid environments. Its structure consists of a thallus that is typically pale to yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Critonia lanicaulis is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
