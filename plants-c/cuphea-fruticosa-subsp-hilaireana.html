<p>Cuphea fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>hilaireana, commonly known as the Hilairean flame flower, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features showy, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden borders and containers in warm climates.</p>
