                    <h1>Chorizema pulteneae</h1>
<p>Chorizema pulteneae, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, pale green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
