                    <h1>Chenopodium foliosum var. exsuccum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium foliosum var. exsuccum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by dry, papery fruits that detach easily from the plant. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
