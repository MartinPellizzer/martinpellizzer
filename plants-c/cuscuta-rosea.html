                    <h1>Cuscuta rosea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rosea, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, thread-like stems called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is often found on crops such as beans, corn, and sunflowers, where it can cause significant damage. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and then the development of flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>Cuscuta rosea is a widespread weed in agricultural fields and is considered a major pest in many regions.</p>
