                    <h1>Crepidium triphyllum</h1>
<p>Crepidium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and its unique triphyllous leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
