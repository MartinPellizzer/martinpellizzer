                    <h1>Cohiba</h1>
<p>Cohiba, commonly known as a type of cigar, is not a plant but a product made from tobacco.</p>
<p>However, the tobacco used in Cohiba cigars comes from the Nicotiana tabacum plant, which is a flowering plant in the nightshade family. The leaves of this plant are cultivated in specific regions known for their ideal climate and soil conditions. These leaves are then processed through curing and fermentation to develop the distinct flavor profile of Cohiba cigars.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Nicotiana tabacum are essential in determining the quality and aroma of the final product.</p>
