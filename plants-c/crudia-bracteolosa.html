                    <h1>Crudia bracteolosa</h1>
<p>Crudia bracteolosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
