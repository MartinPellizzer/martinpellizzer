                    <h1>Combretum griffithii</h1>
<p>Combretum griffithii, commonly known as the red-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stem is often covered with a thick, corky layer, which helps it withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>
