                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. aridus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. aridus, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common invader in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable forage crop and an invasive species in many ecosystems.</p>
