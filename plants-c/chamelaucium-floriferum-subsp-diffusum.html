<p>Chamelaucium floriferum subsp.</p>
<p>diffusum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value.</p>
