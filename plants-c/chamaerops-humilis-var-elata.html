<p>Chamaerops humilis var. elata, commonly known as the tall date palm, is a variety of the dwarf date palm native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and long, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible dates, though the fruit is less prominent than in other date palm varieties. It is well adapted to coastal and rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The variety is characterized by its upright growth habit and is more robust than the typical Chamaerops humilis.</p>
