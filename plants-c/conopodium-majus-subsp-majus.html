<p>Conopodium majus subsp.</p>
<p>majus, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its branched, root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels, and it is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and its unique adaptations for both photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition.</p>
