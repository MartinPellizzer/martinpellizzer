                    <h1>Chiloglottis formicifera</h1>
<p>Chiloglottis formicifera, commonly known as the ant-feeding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a narrow, leaf-like structure called a "leaf-like petiole.". The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by ants, which are attracted to its nectar. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and pollination strategy, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
