<p>Castilleja pumila, commonly known as the dwarf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain host plants, drawing nutrients through its haustoria.</p>
<p>Castilleja pumila is often found in open, dry areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
