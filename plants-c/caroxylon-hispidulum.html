                    <h1>Caroxylon hispidulum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon hispidulum, commonly known as the hispid desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Caroxylon hispidulum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
