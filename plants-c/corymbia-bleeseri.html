<p>Corymbia bleeseri, commonly known as the Bleecker's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The wood of Corymbia bleeseri is hard and heavy, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and ceremonial purposes.</p>
