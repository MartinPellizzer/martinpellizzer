                    <h1>Cuscuta reflexa var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta reflexa var. densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a dense, branched structure with numerous tiny, thread-like stems. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species, including agricultural crops and wild plants. It spreads through seeds and can form dense mats on its host, often causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant ecology and host-parasite interactions.</p>
