<p>Carex vulpina var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, forming tussocks that help stabilize soil in moist habitats. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wetland ecosystems.</p>
