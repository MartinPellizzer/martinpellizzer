<p>Coptidium pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often form a compact, upright rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of deciduous or coniferous forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Coptidium pallasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
