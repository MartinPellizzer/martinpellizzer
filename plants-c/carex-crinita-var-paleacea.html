<p>Carex crinita var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its pale, bluish-green foliage distinguishes it from other Carex species, and it produces small, clustered brownish flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
