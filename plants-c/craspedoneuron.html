                    <h1>Craspedoneuron</h1>
<p>Craspedoneuron, commonly known as the velvet ant, is a type of wasp that belongs to the family Pompilidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique appearance, with a hairy, often brightly colored body that resembles a beetle. The plant aspect of Craspedoneuron is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a botanical species. Therefore, it does not have botanical features such as leaves, flowers, or roots.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is more related to pollination and pest control rather than botanical study.</p>
