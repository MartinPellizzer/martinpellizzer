                    <h1>Carpodetus denticulatus</h1>
<p>Carpodetus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed broom, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, tooth-like projections. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in arid environments.</p>
