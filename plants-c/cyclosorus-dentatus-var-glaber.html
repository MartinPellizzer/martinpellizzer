<p>Cyclosorus dentatus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to freshwater environments in temperate regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread through stolons and form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are usually smooth and lack the serrations found in the typical variety, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
