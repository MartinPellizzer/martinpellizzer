                    <h1>Cladopus yinggelingensis</h1>
<p>Cladopus yinggelingensis, commonly known as the Yinggeling rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist rocky habitats, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
