                    <h1>Cuscuta mearnsii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta mearnsii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other plants in arid environments. It is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
