                    <h1>Corallorhiza involuta</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza involuta, commonly known as the pinkroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has a slender, often branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are typically hidden beneath the soil. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, with a tubular shape and a distinctive spur.</p>
<p>It is found in moist, shaded woodlands across eastern North America, where it thrives in the nutrient-rich environment provided by its fungal partners.</p>
