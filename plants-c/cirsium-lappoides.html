<p>Cirsium lappoides, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Cirsium lappoides is adapted to low temperatures and has a deep root system to access nutrients and water in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
