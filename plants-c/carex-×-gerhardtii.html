                    <h1>Carex × gerhardtii</h1>
<p>Carex × gerhardtii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Carex breviculmis and Carex muricata, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with stamens and pistils arranged in a single plane, typical of the sedge family.</p>
