<p>Cycas nongnoochiae, commonly known as the Nong Nooch cycas, is a rare cycad species native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, both typically appearing at the base of the trunk. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
