<p>Carex longerostrata, commonly known as the long-beak sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
