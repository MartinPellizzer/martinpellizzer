                    <h1>Calanthe clavicalcar</h1>
<p>Calanthe clavicalcar, commonly known as the clustered calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe clavicalcar is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
