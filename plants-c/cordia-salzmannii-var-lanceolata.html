                    <h1>Cordia salzmannii var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Cordia salzmannii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often glabrous and have a distinct reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a prominent red or purple throat. These flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
