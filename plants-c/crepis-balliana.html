<p>Crepis balliana, commonly known as the Ball's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with ray florets surrounding a central disc, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Crepis balliana is often found in meadows and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for pollinators.</p>
