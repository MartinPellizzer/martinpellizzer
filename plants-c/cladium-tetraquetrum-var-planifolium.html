                    <h1>Cladium tetraquetrum var. planifolium</h1>
<p>Cladium tetraquetrum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention and photosynthesis in saturated soils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in marshy areas. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
