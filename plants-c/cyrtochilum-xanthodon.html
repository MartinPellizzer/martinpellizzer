                    <h1>Cyrtochilum xanthodon</h1>
<p>Cyrtochilum xanthodon, commonly known as the golden-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow lip, which is a prominent feature in its floral morphology. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical structure includes a sympodial growth pattern and pseudobulbs, which help it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat.</p>
