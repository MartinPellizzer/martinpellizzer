                    <h1>Cameraria belizensis</h1>
<p>Cameraria belizensis, commonly known as the Belize leafminer, is a species of moth belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and distinctive larval feeding habits, which involve mining within the leaves of its host plants. The plant it primarily affects is the ceiba tree, *Ceiba pentandra*, which is native to Central and South America. The larvae create serpentine tunnels within the leaf tissue, causing visible damage that can impact the tree's health.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and entomologists due to its specific ecological interactions and potential role in forest ecosystems.</p>
