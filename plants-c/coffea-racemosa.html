                    <h1>Coffea racemosa</h1>
<p>Coffea racemosa, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers that grow in racemes. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the source of its caffeine content.</p>
<p>While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic research.</p>
