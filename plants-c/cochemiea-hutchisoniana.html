<p>Cochemiea hutchisoniana, commonly known as the Hutchison's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus with a dense, branching structure that forms a rounded or cylindrical shape. The plant features green, ribbed stems that are covered with a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Cochemiea hutchisoniana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
