                    <h1>Cocos nucifera var. synphyllica</h1>
<p>Cocos nucifera var. synphyllica, commonly known as the synphyllic coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>The leaves are broader and more rigid compared to the typical coconut palm, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to arid environments, making it more drought-resistant than standard coconut palms. Its fruit produces a smaller, harder nut with a thicker husk.</p>
<p>The plant is primarily cultivated in regions with limited rainfall due to its specialized physiological traits.</p>
