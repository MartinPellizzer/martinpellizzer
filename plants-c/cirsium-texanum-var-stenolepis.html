<p>Cirsium texanum var. stenolepis, commonly known as the Texas thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its unique morphology, including the stiff, bristly hairs on its stems and leaves, helps it deter herbivores and conserve moisture.</p>
