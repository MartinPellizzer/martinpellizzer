                            <h1>Clappertonia Minor</h1>
<p>Clappertonia minor is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid forests of western Africa. It is known for its small, pale green leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Despite its modest appearance, this plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by supporting local pollinators and providing habitat for small insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Clappertonia minor is now classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species for future generations.</p>
