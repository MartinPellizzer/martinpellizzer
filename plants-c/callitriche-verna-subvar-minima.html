<p>Callitriche verna subvar. minima, commonly known as the small spring starwort, is a diminutive aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in shallow freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a delicate, herbaceous appearance. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact size and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water edges.</p>
