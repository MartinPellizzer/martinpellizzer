                    <h1>Coronilla heterophylla</h1>
<p>Coronilla heterophylla, commonly known as the variable crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either trifoliate or pinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Coronilla heterophylla is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
