<p>Capparis tenera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved caper, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a reddish tint when mature.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, black seeds.</p>
