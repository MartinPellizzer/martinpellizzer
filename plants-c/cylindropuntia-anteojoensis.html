                    <h1>Cylindropuntia anteojoensis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia anteojoensis, commonly known as the Anteojo cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its adaptations include reduced leaves and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The Anteojo cholla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
