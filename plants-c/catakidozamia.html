                    <h1>Catakidozamia</h1>
<p>Catakidozamia, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves and a thick, trunk-like stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecious reproduction. Catakidozamia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions.</p>
