                    <h1>Closia pusilla</h1>
<p>Closia pusilla, commonly known as the small clover mite, is a tiny plant-feeding arthropod, not a true plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tetranychidae and is often found on the undersides of leaves, feeding on plant sap. While not a plant itself, it can cause damage to crops and ornamental plants by weakening them. Its presence is often indicated by the webbing and stippling it leaves on foliage.</p>
<p>Closia pusilla thrives in warm, dry conditions and is more prevalent in agricultural settings.</p>
