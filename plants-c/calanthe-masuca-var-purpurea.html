                    <h1>Calanthe masuca var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Calanthe masuca var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-veined calanthe, is a rare and ornamental orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive purple veins and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a deep purple or violet lip, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
