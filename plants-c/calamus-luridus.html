                    <h1>Calamus luridus</h1>
<p>Calamus luridus, commonly known as the yellow flag or golden reed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of its family. Calamus luridus is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in wetland ecosystems is significant.</p>
