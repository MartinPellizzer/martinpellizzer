                    <h1>Canscora decurrens</h1>
<p>Canscora decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in South America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>Canscora decurrens is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
