<p>Cheilanthes speciosissima var. elata, commonly known as the elegant cliffbrake, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive pale midrib. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found on cliffs or in crevices, where it receives ample sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
