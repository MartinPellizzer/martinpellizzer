<p>Casparia porrecta, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a low-growing, spreading habit. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Casparia porrecta plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
