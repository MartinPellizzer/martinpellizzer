                    <h1>Cinnamomum nitidum f. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum nitidum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cinnamonwood, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cinnamon tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often a glossy green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its bark and leaves contain aromatic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
