                    <h1>Cuscuta odontolepis var. fimbriata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta odontolepis var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance with finely fringed structures along its stems. The plant is native to regions in Asia and is often found parasitizing various species of legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants via specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
