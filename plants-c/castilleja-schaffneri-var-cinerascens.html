                    <h1>Castilleja schaffneri var. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Castilleja schaffneri var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens paintbrush, is a species of flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, red to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands in the western United States.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its pale, ashy-colored stems and leaves, giving it its scientific name.</p>
