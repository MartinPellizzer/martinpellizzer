<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
