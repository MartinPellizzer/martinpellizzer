                    <h1>Cobamba dichotoma</h1>
<p>Cobamba dichotoma, commonly known as the forked cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well-suited for survival in desert conditions.</p>
<p>Cobamba dichotoma plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert organisms.</p>
