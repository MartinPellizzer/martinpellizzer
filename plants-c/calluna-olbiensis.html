                    <h1>Calluna olbiensis</h1>
<p>Calluna olbiensis, commonly known as the Lapland heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and tundra environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are needle-like and dark green, contributing to its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>Calluna olbiensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna.</p>
