                <h1>Corallodiscus bhutanicus</h1>
<p>Corallodiscus bhutanicus, commonly known as the Bhutanese coral disk, is a rare and unique alga found primarily in the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Corallodiscaceae and is characterized by its calcified, coral-like structures that provide it with structural support. The plant exhibits a colonial growth pattern, with individual cells forming intricate, branching filaments. Its reproductive structures are specialized, allowing for both sexual and asexual propagation in its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for marine botanical research.</p>
