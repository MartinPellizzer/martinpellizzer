<p>Cudicia trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Cudweed.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Cudicia trichotoma is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
