<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora subsp.</p>
<p>cesatiana, commonly known as the woolly dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in fine, hair-like tendrils that help it attach to hosts.</p>
<p>The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
