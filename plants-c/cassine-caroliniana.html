                    <h1>Cassine caroliniana</h1>
<p>Cassine caroliniana, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dark purple when mature, which are edible for some wildlife but not for humans. Cassine caroliniana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
