                    <h1>Cactus tectus</h1>
<p>Cactus tectus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its roots are shallow and widespread, enabling it to quickly absorb rainfall.</p>
<p>Despite its tough appearance, the cactus plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife, providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
