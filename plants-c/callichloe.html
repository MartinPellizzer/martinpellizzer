                    <h1>Callichloe</h1>
<p>Callichloe, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. Callichloe species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to their adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, they are often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
