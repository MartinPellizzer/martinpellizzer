                    <h1>Callitriche hamulata f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Callitriche hamulata f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often clustered in the axils of the leaves. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
