<p>Calandrinia cotyledon, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "painted rock," is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces vibrant clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calandrinia cotyledon is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
