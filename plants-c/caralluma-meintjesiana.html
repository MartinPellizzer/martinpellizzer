<p>Caralluma meintjesiana, commonly known as the Meintjes' prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma meintjesiana is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sunlight.</p>
