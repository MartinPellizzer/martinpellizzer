                    <h1>Cypripedium sichuanense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white flowers with a prominent, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories and has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in its cool, humid environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium sichuanense is critically endangered and is protected under various conservation initiatives.</p>
