<p>Cerothamnus cerifer, commonly known as the waxflower, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, waxy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the soft, fuzzy flowers.</p>
<p>Cerothamnus cerifer is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
