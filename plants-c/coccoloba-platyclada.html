                    <h1>Coccoloba platyclada</h1>
<p>Coccoloba platyclada, commonly known as the broad-leaf coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or saline habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are three-sided berries that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions.</p>
