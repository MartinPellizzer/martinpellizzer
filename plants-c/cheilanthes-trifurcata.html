<p>Cheilanthes trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
