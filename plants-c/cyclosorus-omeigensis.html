<p>Cyclosorus omeigensis, commonly known as the Omeig's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, circular formations, giving the genus its name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus omeigensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
