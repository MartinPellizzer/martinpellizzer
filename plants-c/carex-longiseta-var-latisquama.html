<p>Carex longiseta var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-sheath sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical sedge species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
