                    <h1>Callitriche linearis</h1>
<p>Callitriche linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or floating. It is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Callitriche linearis is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
