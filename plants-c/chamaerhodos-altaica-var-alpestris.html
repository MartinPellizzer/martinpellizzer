                    <h1>Chamaerhodos altaica var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Chamaerhodos altaica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chamaerhodos, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery or grayish underside that provides camouflage in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes at high elevations.</p>
