                    <h1>Carex prescottiana var. flabellata</h1>
<p>Carex prescottiana var. flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream edges.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
