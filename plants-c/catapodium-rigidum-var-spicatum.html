<p>Catapodium rigidum var. spicatum, commonly known as the spiny catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and stiff, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
