                    <h1>Cuscuta aurantiaca</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Cuscuta aurantiica, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans, making it an agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly contribute to its invasive nature in many regions.</p>
