                    <h1>Cactus bonplandii</h1>
<p>Cactus bonplandii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are a striking yellow and attract pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
