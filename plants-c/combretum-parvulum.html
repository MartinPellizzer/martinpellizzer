<p>Combretum parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the dry season, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
