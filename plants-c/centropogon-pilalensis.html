<p>Centropogon pilalensis, commonly known as the Pilalén Island grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pilalén in the Galápagos archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, white to pale green florets. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon pilalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
