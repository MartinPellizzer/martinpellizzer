                    <h1>Christella parasitica</h1>
<p>Christella parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and has small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with four petals, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
