<p>Cotyledon agavoides, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. Its leaves can change color in response to light, displaying hues of red, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>Cotyledon agavoides is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
