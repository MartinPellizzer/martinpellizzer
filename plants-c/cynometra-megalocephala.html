                    <h1>Cynometra megalocephala</h1>
<p>Cynometra megalocephala, commonly known as the large-headed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, hard wood and evergreen leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense wood, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat.</p>
