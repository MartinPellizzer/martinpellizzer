<p>Cirsium acaule subsp.</p>
<p>acaule, commonly known as the naked stem thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems that are often hairless, and its basal rosette of large, lobed, gray-green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny nature, it is typically avoided by herbivores, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
