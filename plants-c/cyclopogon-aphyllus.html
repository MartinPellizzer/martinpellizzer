                    <h1>Cyclopogon aphyllus</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless cyclopogon, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the majority of its structure consisting of a dense cluster of bracts.

It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it is a rare and intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
