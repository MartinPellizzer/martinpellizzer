<p>Crocus orphanidis, commonly known as the orphan's crocus, is a rare and delicate perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which are typically surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, dry environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
