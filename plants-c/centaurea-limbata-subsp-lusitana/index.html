                            <h1>Centaurea Limbata Subsp. Lusitana</h1>
<p>Lusitanian centaury, scientifically known as Centaurea limbata subsp. lusitana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. This subspecies belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers and slender, hairy stems. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the Lusitanian centaury is considered endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest. Its unique appearance and limited distribution highlight its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
