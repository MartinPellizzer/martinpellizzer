<p>Crenea maritima, commonly known as the sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shores and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions makes it a hardy, resilient species.</p>
<p>Crenea maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
