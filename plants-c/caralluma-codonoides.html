                    <h1>Caralluma codonoides</h1>
<p>Caralluma codonoides, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma codonoides is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies for its purported health benefits.</p>
