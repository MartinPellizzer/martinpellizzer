                    <h1>Crepidium merapiense</h1>
<p>Crepidium merapiense, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the volcanic regions of Java, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a unique three-lobed lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
