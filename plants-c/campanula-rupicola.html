                    <h1>Campanula rupicola</h1>
<p>Campanula rupicola, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Campanula rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
