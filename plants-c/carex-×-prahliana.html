                    <h1>Carex × prahliana</h1>
<p>Carex × prahliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is commonly found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and persistent species in its native habitat.</p>
