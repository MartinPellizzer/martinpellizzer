                    <h1>Cuscuta anguina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta anguina, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. Cuscuta anguina is found in various regions worldwide and can parasitize a wide range of plants, including crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant for extended periods.</p>
