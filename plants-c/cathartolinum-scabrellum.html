                <h1>Cathartolinum scabrellum</h1>
<p>Cathartolinum scabrellum, commonly known as the rough-skin cathartolinum, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, it is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
