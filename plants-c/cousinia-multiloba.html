<p>Cousinia multiloba, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming structure, characterized by its dense cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant features hairy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia multiloba is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats.</p>
