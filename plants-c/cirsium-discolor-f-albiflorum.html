                    <h1>Cirsium discolor f. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Cirsium discolor f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered thistle, is a botanical variant of the common plume thistle.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white to pale blue flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or pink blooms of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Its foliage consists of spiny, lobed leaves, typical of the Cirsium genus.</p>
<p>The white-flowered form is less common than the standard variety, making it a notable ornamental and horticultural specimen.</p>
