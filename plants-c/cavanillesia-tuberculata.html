                <h1>Cavanillesia tuberculata</h1>
<p>Cavanillesia tuberculata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
