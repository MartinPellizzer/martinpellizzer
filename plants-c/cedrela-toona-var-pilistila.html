<p>Cedrela toona var. pilistila, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany or pilistila, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale to reddish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, lightweight timber, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
