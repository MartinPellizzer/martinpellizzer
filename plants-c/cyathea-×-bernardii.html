                    <h1>Cyathea × bernardii</h1>
<p>Cyathea × bernardii, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyathea cooperi and Cyathea humilis.</p>
<p>It is a tall, upright fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of over 3 meters. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem covered in fibrous, persistent roots, typical of tree ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
