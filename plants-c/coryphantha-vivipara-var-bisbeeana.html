                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. bisbeeana</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. bisbeeana, commonly known as the Bisbee cactus, is a rare and distinctive species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch near the base, forming a low, compact plant. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live young through its stems, which produce offsets.</p>
<p>This variety is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited distribution.</p>
