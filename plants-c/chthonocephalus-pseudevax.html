                    <h1>Chthonocephalus pseudevax</h1>
<p>Chthonocephalus pseudevax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
