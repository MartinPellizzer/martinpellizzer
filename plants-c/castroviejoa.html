                    <h1>Castroviejoa</h1>
<p>Castroviejoa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in the late afternoon. The plants typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them conserve water in harsh environments. Castroviejoa species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
