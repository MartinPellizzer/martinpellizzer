                            <h1>Crotalaria Biflora</h1>
<p>Biflora crotalaria, scientifically known as Crotalaria biflora, is a unique flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. This species is distinguished by its striking two-flowered inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Crotalaria genus. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in grasslands and savannas. Its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive pod structure make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, Crotalaria biflora is increasingly being studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture and conservation efforts.</p>
