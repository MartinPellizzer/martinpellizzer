<p>Crataegus efferta, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3â€“8 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans.</p>
<p>Crataegus efferta is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
