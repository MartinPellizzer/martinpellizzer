<p>Clematis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, yellowish flowers emerging directly from the stems. The plant typically grows along stream banks and moist woodlands, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of foliage, it is valued for its ornamental flowers and ecological benefits.</p>
