                    <h1>Commiphora</h1>
<p>Commiphora, commonly known as myrrh, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. They are characterized by their aromatic resins, which have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, incense, and religious rituals. The resin is obtained by making incisions in the bark of the tree, allowing the sap to harden into a gum-like substance.</p>
<p>Commiphora species vary in size, with some being small shrubs and others growing as trees up to 10 meters tall.</p>
