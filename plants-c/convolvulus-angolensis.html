                    <h1>Convolvulus angolensis</h1>
<p>Convolvulus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow or white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and can spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
