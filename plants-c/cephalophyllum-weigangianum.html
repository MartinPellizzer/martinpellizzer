                    <h1>Cephalophyllum weigangianum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum weigangianum, commonly known as the Weigang's ghost flower, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to a small region in northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems and striking, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
