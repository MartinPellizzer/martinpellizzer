<p>Campanula panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutin's bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula panjutinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution.</p>
