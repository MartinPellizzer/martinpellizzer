                    <h1>Crepidium kinabaluense</h1>
<p>Crepidium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the montane regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in the cool, moist, and shaded environments of the mountain's upper elevations. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a compact inflorescence bearing several white to pale pink flowers. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
