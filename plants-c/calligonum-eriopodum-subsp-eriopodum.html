<p>Calligonum eriopodum subsp.</p>
<p>eriopodum, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
