                    <h1>Cuscuta papillosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta papillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches itself to host plants using specialized suction cups called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. Cuscuta papillosa is found in various regions, including North America, and often grows on crops such as soybeans and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the wind, and it can be a significant agricultural pest.</p>
