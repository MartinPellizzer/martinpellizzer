                    <h1>Chironia decussata</h1>
<p>Chironia decussata, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive arrowhead shape at the base. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters along the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Chironia decussata is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
