                    <h1>Corybas muluensis</h1>
<p>Corybas muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family found in the tropical rainforests of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial herb is characterized by its small, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on the forest floor or on mossy rocks. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, strikingly colored flower that is pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
