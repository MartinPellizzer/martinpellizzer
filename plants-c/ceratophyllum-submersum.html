                    <h1>Ceratophyllum submersum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum submersum, commonly known as water fir, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has a branching, bushy structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for roots. The plant lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a compact, dense growth form that provides habitat for aquatic organisms. It reproduces through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum submersum is often used in aquariums and pond ecosystems due to its ability to oxygenate water and control algae growth.</p>
