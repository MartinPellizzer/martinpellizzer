<p>Crotalaria deserticola subsp.</p>
<p>deserticola, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with erect, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
