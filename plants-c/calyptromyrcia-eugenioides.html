<p>Calyptromyrcia eugenioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
