                    <h1>Cusparia martiana</h1>
<p>Cusparia martiana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, thick stem and clusters of spiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing underground water. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
