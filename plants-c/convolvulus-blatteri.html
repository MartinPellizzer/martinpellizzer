                    <h1>Convolvulus blatteri</h1>
<p>Convolvulus blatteri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant blue or purple funnel-shaped flowers, which bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Convolvulus blatteri is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
