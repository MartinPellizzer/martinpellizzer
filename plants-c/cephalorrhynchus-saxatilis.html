                    <h1>Cephalorrhynchus saxatilis</h1>
<p>Cephalorrhynchus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky environments, particularly on limestone and granite, where it forms a crust-like growth. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs nutrients through its thallus, a structure composed of fungal hyphae. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
