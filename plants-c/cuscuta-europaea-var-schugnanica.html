                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. schugnanica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. schugnanica, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on crops like wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations that negatively impact agricultural yields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
