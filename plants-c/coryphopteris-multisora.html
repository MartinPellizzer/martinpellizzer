<p>Coryphopteris multisora, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the undersides of the leaves. Coryphopteris multisora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical flora.</p>
