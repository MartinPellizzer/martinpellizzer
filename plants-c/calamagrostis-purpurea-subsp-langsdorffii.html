<p>Calamagrostis purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>langsdorffii, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of purple-tinged flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
