                    <h1>Corylus</h1>
<p>Corylus, commonly known as the hazelnut or hazel, is a genus of deciduous shrubs or small trees in the family Betulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. The fruit is a坚果 (nut) enclosed in a spiny husk, which matures in the fall. Corylus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland edges and moist soils.</p>
<p>They play an important role in both ecological systems and human agriculture, particularly for their edible nuts.</p>
