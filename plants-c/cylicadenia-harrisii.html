<p>Cylicadenia harrisii, commonly known as Harris's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Native to specific regions in South Africa, it thrives in sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
