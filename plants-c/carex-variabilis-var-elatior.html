                    <h1>Carex variabilis var. elatior</h1>
<p>Carex variabilis var. elatior, commonly known as the tall sedges, is a variant of the variable sedge, characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This sedge is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
