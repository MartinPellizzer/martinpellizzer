                    <h1>Cheilanthes robusta</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes robusta, commonly known as the rock brake or desert fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tough, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it thrives in poor soil conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ability to reproduce in challenging habitats.</p>
