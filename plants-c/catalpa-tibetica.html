                    <h1>Catalpa tibetica</h1>
<p>Catalpa tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Catalpa tibetica is often found in forested areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
