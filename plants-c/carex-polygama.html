<p>Carex polygama, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex polygama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
