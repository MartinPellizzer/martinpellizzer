                    <h1>Crossophrys chamissonis</h1>
<p>Crossophrys chamissonis, commonly known as the white spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, producing a fragrant, nectar-rich display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
