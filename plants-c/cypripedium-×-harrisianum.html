<p>Cypripedium × harrisianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium reginae, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces a single, showy purple or pink pouch-like flower with a distinctive slipper-shaped lip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
