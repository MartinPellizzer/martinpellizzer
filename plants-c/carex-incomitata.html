                    <h1>Carex incomitata</h1>
<p>Carex incomitata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex incomitata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
