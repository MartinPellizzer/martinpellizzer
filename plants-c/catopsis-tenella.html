                    <h1>Catopsis tenella</h1>
<p>Catopsis tenella, commonly known as the miniature fern or baby's tears, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright green, thread-like fronds that grow in dense, carpet-like clusters. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Catopsis tenella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its lush, foliage appearance.</p>
