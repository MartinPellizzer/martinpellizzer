                    <h1>Ctenopteris vomaensis</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris vomaensis, commonly known as the Vomaensia water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
