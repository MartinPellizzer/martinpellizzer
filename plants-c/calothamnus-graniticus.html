                    <h1>Calothamnus graniticus</h1>
<p>Calothamnus graniticus, commonly known as the granite daisybush, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Calothamnus graniticus is often found on granite outcrops and is a symbol of the unique flora of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot.</p>
