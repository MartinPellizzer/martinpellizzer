                    <h1>Calyptraria haemantha</h1>
<p>Calyptraria haemantha, commonly known as the scarlet lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange to red thallus.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with distinct lobes and a layered upper cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy while the fungal component offers protection and structure. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Calyptraria haemantha is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
