<p>Cryophytum salteri, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a small, succulent plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold climates with limited nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the brief summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low light conditions.</p>
<p>Cryophytum salteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme habitat.</p>
