<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris f. orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf weed.</p>
<p>This variant of the common chickweed exhibits a distinctive orbicular leaf shape, differing from the typical ovate leaves of the species. The plant is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small white flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces distinctive bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
