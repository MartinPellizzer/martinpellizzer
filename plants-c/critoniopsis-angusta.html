                    <h1>Critoniopsis angusta</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf critoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of ongoing study in the field of plant biology.</p>
