<p>Coccothrinax clarensis subsp.</p>
<p>clarensis, commonly known as the Clarendon palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
