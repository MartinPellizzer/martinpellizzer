<p>Catopsis oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's catopsis, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
