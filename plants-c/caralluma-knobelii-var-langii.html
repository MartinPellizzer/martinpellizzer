                    <h1>Caralluma knobelii var. langii</h1>
<p>Caralluma knobelii var. langii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat.</p>
