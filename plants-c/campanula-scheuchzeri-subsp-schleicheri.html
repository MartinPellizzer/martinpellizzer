<p>Campanula scheuchzeri subsp.</p>
<p>schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
