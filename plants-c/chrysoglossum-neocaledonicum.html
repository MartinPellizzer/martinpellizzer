                    <h1>Chrysoglossum neocaledonicum</h1>
<p>Chrysoglossum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian chrysoglossum, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near stream banks or in rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
