<p>Canistrum exiguum, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
