<p>Citrullus colocynthis var. capensis, commonly known as the African bitter apple, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are highly toxic due to the presence of cucurbitacin. These fruits are typically covered in a rough, spiny husk and are often used in traditional medicine despite their toxicity.</p>
<p>The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
