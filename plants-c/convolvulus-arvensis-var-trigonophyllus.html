<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. trigonophyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
