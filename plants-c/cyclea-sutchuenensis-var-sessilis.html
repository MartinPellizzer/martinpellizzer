                    <h1>Cyclea sutchuenensis var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Cyclea sutchuenensis var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf cycloe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a sessile (stemless) attachment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that are typically orange-red in color. It is often found growing in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species.</p>
