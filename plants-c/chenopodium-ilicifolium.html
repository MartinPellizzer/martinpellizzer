<p>Chenopodium ilicifolium, commonly known as silverleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically flowering in the summer months. Its seeds are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Chenopodium ilicifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
