<p>Cyclosorus plurifolius, commonly known as the many-leaved cyclosorus, is a lesser-known species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and intricate leaf arrangement. The plant features closely packed, spirally arranged leaves that form a compact rosette, with each leaf typically having a narrow, elongated shape. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf cushions and aid in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus plurifolius is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
