<p>Chrysosplenium lanuginosum var. pilosomarginatum, commonly known as the fuzzyleaf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of softly hairy, ovate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense spike-like inflorescences.

<p>Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in wetland habitats.</p>
