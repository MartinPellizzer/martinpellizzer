                    <h1>Chlorogalum leichtlinii</h1>
<p>Chlorogalum leichtlinii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears a cluster of white or pale pink flowers during the spring. Its flowers are tubular and adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
