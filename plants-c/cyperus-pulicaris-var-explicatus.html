                    <h1>Cyperus pulicaris var. explicatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pulicaris var. explicatus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or damp soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
