<p>Calyptrogyne costatifrons subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western broadleaf seagrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are adapted to thrive in shallow, sandy-bottom habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
