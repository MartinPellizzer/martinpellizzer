                    <h1>Casuarina nodiflora</h1>
<p>Casuarina nodiflora, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called "gymnospermous" cones that contain the seeds. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and along shorelines.</p>
<p>Casuarina nodiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
