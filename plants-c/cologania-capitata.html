                    <h1>Cologania capitata</h1>
<p>Cologania capitata, commonly known as the clustered candelabra plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its unique succulent structure.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features a dense, multi-stemmed base with clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish-green, and appear in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
