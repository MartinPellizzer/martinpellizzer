                    <h1>Cycas truncata</h1>
<p>Cycas truncata, commonly known as the sago palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Cycas truncata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil, with a history dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
