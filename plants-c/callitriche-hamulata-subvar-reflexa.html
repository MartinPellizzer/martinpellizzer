<p>Callitriche hamulata subvar. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed waterstar, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often reflexed, meaning they curve backward. Its flowers are tiny, with four petals, and it produces small, dark blue or black seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
