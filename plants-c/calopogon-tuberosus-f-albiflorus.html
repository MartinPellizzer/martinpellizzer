                    <h1>Calopogon tuberosus f. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Calopogon tuberosus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare variant of the bog orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with the usual greenish-yellow blooms of the typical species. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, particularly in bogs and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its tuberous roots help it survive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The white-flowered form is a naturally occurring mutation, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
