                    <h1>Carduus hookerianus</h1>
<p>Carduus hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive, purple-tinged flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or arid regions. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.</p>
