<p>Crataegus desueta var. wausaukiensis, commonly known as the Wausauki serviceberry, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.</p>
