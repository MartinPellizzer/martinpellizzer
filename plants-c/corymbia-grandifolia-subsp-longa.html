<p>Corymbia grandifolia subsp.</p>
<p>longa, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>

<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant tree.</p>
