<p>Coleotrype laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian shield lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer of spores. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the photosynthetic capability necessary for its survival. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in northern regions.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
