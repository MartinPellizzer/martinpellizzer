                    <h1>Cleistocactus buchtienii var. flavispinus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus buchtienii var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined globose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is covered in dense, woolly white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
