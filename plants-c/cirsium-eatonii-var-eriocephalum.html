<p>Cirsium eatonii var. eriocephalum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny, purple-blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flower heads are composed of many small, tubular florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
