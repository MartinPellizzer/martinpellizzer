                    <h1>Cururu incisa</h1>
<p>Cururu incisa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a fine, even texture. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Cururu incisa is valued for its high-quality timber, which is used in musical instruments and fine furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
