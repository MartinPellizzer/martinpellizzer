                            <h1>Ciconium Malvifolium</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Ciconium malvifolium, is a striking tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests and wetlands. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it both an ornamental and an ecologically significant species. Despite its beauty, Velvetleaf can become invasive in certain areas, posing challenges for local ecosystems.</p>
