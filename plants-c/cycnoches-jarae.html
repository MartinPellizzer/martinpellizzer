<p>Cycnoches jarae, commonly known as the Jarae water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
<p>Cycnoches jarae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
