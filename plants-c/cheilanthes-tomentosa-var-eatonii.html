                    <h1>Cheilanthes tomentosa var. eatonii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes tomentosa var. eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and thick, hairy, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xeric environments.</p>
