<p>Calligonum crispatum, commonly known as the crinkled saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive crinkled, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Its resilience and hardiness make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
