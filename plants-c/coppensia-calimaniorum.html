<p>Coppensia calimaniorum, commonly known as the Calimaniorum cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studying plant evolution and biodiversity.</p>
