<p>Corybas serpentinus, commonly known as the serpent's tongue orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or serpentine habitats. The plant produces a single, strikingly shaped flower that resembles a serpent's tongue, hence its common name. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, hood-like structure that protects the reproductive organs.</p>
