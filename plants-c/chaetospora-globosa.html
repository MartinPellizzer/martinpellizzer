                    <h1>Chaetospora globosa</h1>
<p>Chaetospora globosa, commonly known as the globe-spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called paraphyses. The plant produces spore capsules that are spherical and typically clustered in groups, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species for studying the ecology and evolution of bryophytes.</p>
