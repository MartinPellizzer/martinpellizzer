<p>It belongs to the family Helicarionidae and is characterized by its spiral shell and moist, slimy body. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the presence of a mantle that secretes the shell are key botanical features. It thrives in humid environments, often found in forests and gardens.</p>
<p>The snail's feeding habits involve consuming decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
