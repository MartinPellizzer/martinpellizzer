                    <h1>Cactus aureus</h1>
<p>Cactus aureus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus aureus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
