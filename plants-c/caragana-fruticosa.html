                    <h1>Caragana fruticosa</h1>
<p>Caragana fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub locust, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes and mountains of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by legume pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Caragana fruticosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
