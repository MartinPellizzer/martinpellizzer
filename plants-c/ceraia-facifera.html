                    <h1>Ceraia facifera</h1>
<p>Ceraia facifera, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, fleshy cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body develops from a basal stem called a volva, which is often covered in a slimy, sticky substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found decomposing organic matter in forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its foul smell and unusual appearance, it is both fascinating and somewhat repulsive to observers.</p>
