                    <h1>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana var. glauca</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Glauca cedar, is a variant of the Lawson cypress native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is dense and scale-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a pyramidal shape that becomes more conical with age, and its bark is reddish-brown and peels in thin, fibrous strips. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish cones and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>This evergreen is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
