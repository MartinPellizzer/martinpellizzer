<p>Columella irosinensis, commonly known as the Irosin columnar cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has spiny, green stems that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Columella irosinensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
