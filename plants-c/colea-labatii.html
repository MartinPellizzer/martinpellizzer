<p>Colea labatii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Colea labatii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
