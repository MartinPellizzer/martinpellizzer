                    <h1>Conophytum subtile</h1>
<p>Conophytum subtile, commonly known as the "Little Cone Plant," is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, cone-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its compact size and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Conophytum subtile is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it an ideal plant for xeriscaping.</p>
