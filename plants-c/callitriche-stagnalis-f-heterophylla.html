                    <h1>Callitriche stagnalis f. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Callitriche stagnalis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually narrow and lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which help in pollination by aquatic insects.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its morphological variation in leaf shape compared to the typical form of Callitriche stagnalis.</p>
