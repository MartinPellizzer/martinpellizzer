<p>Cynoctonum microstemma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
