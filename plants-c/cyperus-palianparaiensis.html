                    <h1>Cyperus palianparaiensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus palianparaiensis, commonly known as the Palianparai flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to the wetlands of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyperus palianparaiensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
