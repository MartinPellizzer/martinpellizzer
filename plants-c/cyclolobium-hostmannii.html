<p>Cyclolobium hostmannii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Cyclolobium hostmannii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
