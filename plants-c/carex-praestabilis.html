                    <h1>Carex praestabilis</h1>
<p>Carex praestabilis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually wider than those of other sedges, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Carex praestabilis is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
