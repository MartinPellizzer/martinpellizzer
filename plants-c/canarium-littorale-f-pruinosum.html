<p>Canarium littorale f. pruinosum, commonly known as the coastal canarium, is a variant of the canarium species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a pruinose appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found in mangrove or tidal forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to coastal conditions, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological balance in such habitats.</p>
