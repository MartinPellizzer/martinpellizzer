<p>Cypripedium irapeanum subsp.</p>
<p>molle, commonly known as the soft yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow pouch-like structure that serves as a pollination trap.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
