                <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum, commonly known as hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across the globe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, feather-like leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long and have a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant does not have true roots but instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. It is capable of reproducing both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life.</p>
