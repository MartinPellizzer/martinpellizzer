                    <h1>Cuscuta americana var. congesta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta americana var. congesta, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant forms dense networks around its host, often leading to reduced growth and vigor in the host plant. It is found in various habitats across North America, including fields, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new hosts make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
