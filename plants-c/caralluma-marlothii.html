                    <h1>Caralluma marlothii</h1>
<p>Caralluma marlothii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caralluma marlothii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well-adapted to survive in drought conditions.</p>
