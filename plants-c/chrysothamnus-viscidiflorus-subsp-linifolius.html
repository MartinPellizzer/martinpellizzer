<p>Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>linifolius, commonly known as stickyflower goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, sticky, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which is a common feature in the genus Chrysothamnus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid climates and limited water availability.</p>
