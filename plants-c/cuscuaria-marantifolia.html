                    <h1>Cuscuaria marantifolia</h1>
<p>Cuscuaria marantifolia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
