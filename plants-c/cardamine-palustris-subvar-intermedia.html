<p>Cardamine palustris subvar. intermedia, commonly known as the marsh cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The species is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
