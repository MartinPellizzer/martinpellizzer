<p>Crotalaria patula, commonly known as yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow, spurred flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, which host symbiotic bacteria. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with native plants and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
