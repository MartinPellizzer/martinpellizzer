                    <h1>Cuscuta japonica var. fissistyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta japonica var. fissistyla, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
