                    <h1>Carum viviparum</h1>
<p>Carum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous caraway, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its viviparous reproduction method, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces a distinctive, spicy aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Carum viviparum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
