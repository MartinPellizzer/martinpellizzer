                    <h1>Clidemia quinquenodis</h1>
<p>Clidemia quinquenodis, commonly known as the five-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
