                    <h1>Coniogramme falcipinna</h1>
<p>Coniogramme falcipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and prefers shaded, moist conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
