                    <h1>Corallorhiza multiflora var. sulphurea</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza multiflora var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur-tinged coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is highly sensitive to ecological disturbances.</p>
