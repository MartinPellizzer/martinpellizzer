                    <h1>Cyclosorus pilososquamatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus pilososquamatus, commonly known as the hairy scale fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, hairy scales. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
