                    <h1>Cousinia hamulosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia hamulosa, commonly known as the hooked couchgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in steppe and desert environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions by anchoring it in the soil and accessing deep water sources.</p>
<p>Cousinia hamulosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
