<p>Cieca ackermanniana, commonly known as the Ackermann's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green leaves and elongated, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
