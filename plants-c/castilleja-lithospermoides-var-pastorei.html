                    <h1>Castilleja lithospermoides var. pastorei</h1>
<p>Castilleja lithospermoides var. pastorei, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red to orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
