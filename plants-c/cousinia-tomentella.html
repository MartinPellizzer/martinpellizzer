<p>Cousinia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
