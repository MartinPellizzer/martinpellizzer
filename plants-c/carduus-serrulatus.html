<p>Carduus serrulatus, commonly known as the sickle thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, spiny leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, upright head, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can compete with other vegetation.</p>
