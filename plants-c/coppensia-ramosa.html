                    <h1>Coppensia ramosa</h1>
<p>Coppensia ramosa, commonly known as the slender swamp rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Coppensia ramosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water quality.</p>
