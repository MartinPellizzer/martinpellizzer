<p>Cheilanthes fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant rock fern, is a perennial epiphytic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky crevices and shaded forest environments, where it attaches itself to trees or stones for support. The plant features a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed. Its unique characteristic is the emission of a subtle, pleasant fragrance, particularly noticeable when the fronds are disturbed.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings.</p>
