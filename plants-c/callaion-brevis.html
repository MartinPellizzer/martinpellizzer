                    <h1>Callaion brevis</h1>
<p>Callaion brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed calla, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers, while small, are highly attractive to pollinators like beetles and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
