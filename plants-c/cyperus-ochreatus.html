<p>Cyperus ochreatus, commonly known as the yellow papyrus or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Cyperus ochreatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
