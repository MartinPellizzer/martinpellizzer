<p>Caprifolium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Caprifolium hispidum is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
