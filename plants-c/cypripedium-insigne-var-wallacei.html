                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. wallacei</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. wallacei, commonly known as the Wallace's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
