                    <h1>Cervaria</h1>
<p>Cervaria, commonly known as the "sphagnum moss," is a type of moss belonging to the family Sphagnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, spongy, and water-retentive structure, which allows it to thrive in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and peatlands. The plant's rhizoids anchor it to the substrate, while its leafy shoots form dense mats that contribute to soil formation. Cervaria is also known for its ability to absorb and store large amounts of water, playing a crucial role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological impact and its role in carbon sequestration.</p>
