<p>Chromatotriccum brachycentrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its fibrous roots. The plant has delicate, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, arranged in a rosette formation. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three petals and six stamens, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Chromatotriccum brachycentrum plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
