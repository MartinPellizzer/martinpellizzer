                    <h1>Caltha palustris var. himalensis</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris var. himalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its leaves are broadly ovate and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in alpine habitats.</p>
