                    <h1>Camarotis uncinata</h1>
<p>Camarotis uncinata, commonly known as the hooked leaf gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique life cycle, where the larvae induce the formation of leaf galls on host plants. The plant's botanical features are closely linked to its interaction with the host, typically affecting species within the genus Quercus. The galls formed are often spherical or lobed, providing a protected environment for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, contributing to the diversity of plant-insect interactions.</p>
