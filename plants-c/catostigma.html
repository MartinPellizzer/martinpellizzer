                    <h1>Catostigma</h1>
<p>Catostigma, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with humid climates. They typically have opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and their flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences. The stems are often hairy and can be somewhat woody in mature plants.</p>
<p>Catostigma species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their ecological roles and adaptations to their native environments.</p>
