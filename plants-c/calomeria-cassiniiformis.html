<p>Calomeria cassiniiformis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Calomeria cassiniiformis is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
