                    <h1>Cuscuta halophyta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta halophyta, commonly known as the saltbush dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cuscutaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange coloration due to the absence of green pigments. This species is typically found in arid and saline environments, where it attaches to various host plants such as shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations enable it to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
