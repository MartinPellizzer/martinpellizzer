                            <h1>Coelorachis Aurita</h1>
<p>Golden star fern, scientifically known as Coelorachis aurita, is a strikingly beautiful epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its unique appearance, characterized by its bright yellow spore-bearing structures, gives it its common name. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it has become a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. Despite its beauty, the Golden star fern requires careful attention to watering and light conditions to flourish.</p>
