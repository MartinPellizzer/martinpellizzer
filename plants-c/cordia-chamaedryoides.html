                    <h1>Cordia chamaedryoides</h1>
<p>Cordia chamaedryoides, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, reddish or yellowish berries. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cordia chamaedryoides is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for wildlife.</p>
