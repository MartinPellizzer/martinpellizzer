<p>Coptidipteris, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Coptidipteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Coptidipteris are still cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
