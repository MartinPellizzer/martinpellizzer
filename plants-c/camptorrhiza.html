<p>Camptorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the Amaryllis family, characterized by its slender, curling stems and striking, violet-colored flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, often appearing as if they are floating in the air due to the way the stems curve.</p>
<p>Camptorrhiza is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various healing purposes.</p>
