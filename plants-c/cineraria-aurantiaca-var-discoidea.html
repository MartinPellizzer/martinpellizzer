                    <h1>Cineraria aurantiaca var. discoidea</h1>
<p>Cineraria aurantiaca var. discoidea, commonly known as the golden disc cineraria, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a bright contrast to its green foliage. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>The variety 'discoidea' is distinguished by its distinctive, disk-like flower structure, which sets it apart from other cineraria species.</p>
