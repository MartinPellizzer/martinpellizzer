                    <h1>Columella</h1>
<p>Columella, commonly known as the columnar stem, is a botanical feature found in certain plants, particularly in the monocot group.</p>
<p>It refers to the central, cylindrical structure that supports the plant and contains the vascular tissues. Unlike the typical stem of dicot plants, the columella is solid and does not have a distinct pith or cortex. This structure is essential for providing mechanical support and facilitating the transport of water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The presence of a columella is often associated with plants that grow in arid or windy environments where structural strength is crucial.</p>
