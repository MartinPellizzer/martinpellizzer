<p>Cryosophila kalbreyeri subsp.</p>
<p>cogolloi, commonly known as the Bog Orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to cold, wet environments. It is native to high-altitude regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in boggy, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which help attract pollinators in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, designed to withstand the damp and cold conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
