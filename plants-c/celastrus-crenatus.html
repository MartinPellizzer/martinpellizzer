                    <h1>Celastrus crenatus</h1>
<p>Celastrus crenatus, commonly known as the Japanese twining vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Celastrus crenatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
