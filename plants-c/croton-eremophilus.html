                    <h1>Croton eremophilus</h1>
<p>Croton eremophilus, commonly known as the desert croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent-like leaves and stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Croton eremophilus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, showcasing its resilience in harsh desert conditions.</p>
