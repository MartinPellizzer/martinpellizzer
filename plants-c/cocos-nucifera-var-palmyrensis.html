<p>Cocos nucifera var. palmyrensis, commonly known as the ancient palm, is a variant of the coconut palm native to the Middle East and parts of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant produces clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its fruits, known as dates, are small, oval, and covered in a hairy husk, containing a sweet, fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its historical and cultural significance in ancient civilizations.</p>
