                    <h1>Cryptogramma stelleri var. foveolata</h1>
<p>Cryptogramma stelleri var. foveolata, commonly known as the Steller's cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
