                    <h1>Cleistogenes</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes, commonly known as the "closed flower" grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique reproductive structures, where the flowers remain closed during pollination, preventing external pollen from entering. Cleistogenes species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They have compact growth forms and often exhibit a basal rosette structure, which helps in conserving water.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species that are important in ecological studies due to their resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
