<p>Clinopodium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with slightly serrated edges and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Clinopodium stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
