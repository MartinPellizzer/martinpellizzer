                    <h1>Cyathea cuspidata var. rigida</h1>
<p>Cyathea cuspidata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid cliff fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and enabling it to anchor itself in challenging substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
