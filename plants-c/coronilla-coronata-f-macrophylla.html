                    <h1>Coronilla coronata f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Coronilla coronata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are larger and more elongated compared to the typical form of Coronilla coronata. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and erosion control.</p>
