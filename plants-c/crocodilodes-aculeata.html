                    <h1>Crocodilodes aculeata</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes aculeata, commonly known as the spiny crocodile plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
