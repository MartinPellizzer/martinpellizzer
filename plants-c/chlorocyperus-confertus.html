<p>Chlorocyperus confertus, commonly known as the dense flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, often forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil in wet areas. Its flowering heads are small and clustered, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Chlorocyperus confertus plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion.</p>
