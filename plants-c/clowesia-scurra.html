                    <h1>Clowesia scurra</h1>
<p>Clowesia scurra, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Clowesia scurra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
