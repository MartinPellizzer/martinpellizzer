                    <h1>Caryodaphnopsis latifolia</h1>
<p>Caryodaphnopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cypress, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caryodaphnopsis latifolia is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
