                    <h1>Caroxylon koichabicum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon koichabicum, commonly known as the Koichabi cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon koichabicum is considered a threatened species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution of coniferous plants in arid and high-altitude environments.</p>
