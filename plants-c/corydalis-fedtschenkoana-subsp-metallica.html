<p>Corydalis fedtschenkoana subsp.</p>
<p>metallica, commonly known as the "Copperleaf Corydalis," is a rare and striking member of the Fumariaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Tibet, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its vibrant coppery-orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a metallic sheen, giving it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
