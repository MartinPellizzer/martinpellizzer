                    <h1>Cleistes montana</h1>
<p>Cleistes montana, commonly known as the mountain cleistostoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oronoideae subfamily and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed throughout most of the growing season. The plant produces its showy, white to pale purple flowers only briefly during late summer, which open only at night. Cleistes montana thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
