<p>Cuviera uncinula, commonly known as the hooked cup fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble delicate cups. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
