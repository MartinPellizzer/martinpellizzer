<p>Clavigera, commonly known as the "broomrape" or "broom plant," is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. Clavigera is found in various regions, including Europe, Asia, and North America, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and lack of leaves make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
