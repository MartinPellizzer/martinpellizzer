<p>Cypholoron frigidum, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to thrive in extremely cold environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often greenish or bluish flowers. This plant typically grows in alpine or arctic regions where temperatures remain low year-round. Its survival depends on specific soil conditions and minimal competition from other flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Cypholoron frigidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
