                    <h1>Cycas rumphii var. subinclusa</h1>
<p>Cycas rumphii var. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and its distinctive, fan-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Cycas rumphii. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically a deep green and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, though it requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
