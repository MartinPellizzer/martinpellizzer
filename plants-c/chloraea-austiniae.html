                    <h1>Chloraea austiniae</h1>
<p>Chloraea austiniae, commonly known as Austin's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments near the coast.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chloraea austiniae is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
