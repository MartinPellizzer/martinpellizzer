<p>Cascarilla heterophylla, commonly known as the Mexican wild cinnamon or wild cinnamon tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented bark. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in strips. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often vary in shape, contributing to its heterophyllous nature.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, yellowish-green bloom that attracts pollinators.</p>
