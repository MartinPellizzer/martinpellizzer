<p>Cactus macromeris, commonly known as the giant barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 15 feet tall. The plant stores water in its succulent stems, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The cactus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
