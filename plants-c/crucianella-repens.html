                    <h1>Crucianella repens</h1>
<p>Crucianella repens, commonly known as the creeping sea bean, is a small, perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, fleshy stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by indehiscent, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Crucianella repens is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats or along the shores.</p>
