                    <h1>Cerochilus</h1>
<p>Cerochilus, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. They are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small lanterns or ghosts, hence their common names. Cerochilus species typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations and role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
