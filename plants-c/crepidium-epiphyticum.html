                    <h1>Crepidium epiphyticum</h1>
<p>Crepidium epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled environments.</p>
