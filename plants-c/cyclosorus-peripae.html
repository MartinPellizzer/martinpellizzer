                    <h1>Cyclosorus peripae</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus peripae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Ceratophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients directly through its leaf blades. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
