                    <h1>Chaetochloa imberbis var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa imberbis var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils. The plant's leaves are slender and often have a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. One of its distinguishing features is the variability in leaf coloration, which can range from green to silver or even red, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variation in appearance contributes to its common name and makes it a visually interesting plant in aquatic habitats.</p>
