<p>Chamaesyce nirurioides, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
