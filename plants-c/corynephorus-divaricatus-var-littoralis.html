<p>Corynephorus divaricatus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal flatsear grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant has flat, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
