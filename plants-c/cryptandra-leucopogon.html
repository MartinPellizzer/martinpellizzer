                    <h1>Cryptandra leucopogon</h1>
<p>Cryptandra leucopogon, commonly known as the white-haired cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and drought-resistant properties make it well adapted to sandy soils and low rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>Cryptandra leucopogon is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
