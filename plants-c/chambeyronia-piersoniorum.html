<p>Chambeyronia piersoniorum, commonly known as the Pierson's chambeyronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy where it receives ample sunlight. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations.</p>
