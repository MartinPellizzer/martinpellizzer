                    <h1>Chlora perfoliata f. exilis</h1>
<p>Chlora perfoliata f. exilis, commonly known as the slender chlora, is a variant of the chlora plant characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs like parsley and carrots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are perfoliate, meaning they are pierced by the stems, creating a unique appearance.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical chlora and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
