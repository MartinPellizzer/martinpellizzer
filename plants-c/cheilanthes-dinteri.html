<p>Cheilanthes dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically found on exposed rock surfaces. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used as an indicator species in arid ecosystems.</p>
