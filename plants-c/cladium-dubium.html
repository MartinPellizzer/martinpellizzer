<p>Cladium dubium, commonly known as the swamp cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater and brackish marshes, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic species. The plant has long, slender leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its flowering spikes are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Cladium dubium plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and erosion control.</p>
