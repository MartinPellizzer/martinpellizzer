                    <h1>Coffea boiviniana</h1>
<p>Coffea boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. The seeds within the fruits are used to make a type of coffee, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea boiviniana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
