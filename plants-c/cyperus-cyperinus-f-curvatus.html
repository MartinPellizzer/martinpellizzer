                    <h1>Cyperus cyperinus f. curvatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyperinus f. curvatus, commonly known as the curly flat sedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often subtended by bracts.</p>
