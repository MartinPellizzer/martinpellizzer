<p>Crassula cephalophora, commonly known as the "Cape snowball," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
