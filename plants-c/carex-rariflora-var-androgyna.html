                    <h1>Carex rariflora var. androgyna</h1>
<p>Carex rariflora var. androgyna, commonly known as the rare-flowered androgynous sedge, is a unique variant of the Carex genus characterized by its androgynous flowers, which contain both male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both staminate and pistillate flowers, facilitating self-pollination. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often clustered at the base.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological and reproductive characteristics.</p>
