<p>Camelina sativa subsp.</p>
<p>zingeri, commonly known as Zinger's camelina, is a lesser-known subspecies of the camelina plant. It is native to parts of Central Asia and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, oval seeds that are rich in oil, making it potentially valuable for agricultural and industrial uses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and less research, its ecological role and full botanical characteristics remain understudied.</p>
