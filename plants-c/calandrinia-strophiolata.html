                    <h1>Calandrinia strophiolata</h1>
<p>Calandrinia strophiolata, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent stems and leaves, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its small, rounded seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Calandrinia strophiolata is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
