                    <h1>Cypripedium × harrisianum var. superbum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × harrisianum var. superbum, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in rich, organic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
