                    <h1>Crassula incana</h1>
<p>Crassula incana, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form, with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or summer.</p>
<p>Crassula incana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
