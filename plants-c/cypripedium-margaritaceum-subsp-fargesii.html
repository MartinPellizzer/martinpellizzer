                    <h1>Cypripedium margaritaceum subsp. fargesii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium margaritaceum subsp.</p>
<p>fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lady's slipper, is a rare and ornate orchid native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
