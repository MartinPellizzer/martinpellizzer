                    <h1>Calyptranthes aguilarii</h1>
<p>Calyptranthes aguilarii, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as those in the genus Ficus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the tips of the branches. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
