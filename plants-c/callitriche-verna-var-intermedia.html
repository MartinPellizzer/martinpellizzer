                    <h1>Callitriche verna var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Callitriche verna var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spring water-star, is a small aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its intermediate characteristics between the typical *C. verna* and other related species.</p>
