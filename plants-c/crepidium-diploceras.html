<p>Crepidium diploceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
