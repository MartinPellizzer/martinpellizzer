<p>Cactus coronaria, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its adaptations include a shallow root system and a waxy coating on the stems to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus coronaria plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
