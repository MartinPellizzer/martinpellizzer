                    <h1>Cuspidaria lachnaea</h1>
<p>Cuspidaria lachnaea, commonly known as the white lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus with a distinctive, crust-like texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a fungal component that anchors it to surfaces, while the algal partner contributes to its pigmentation and energy production.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
