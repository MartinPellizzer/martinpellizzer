                    <h1>Coffea staudtii</h1>
<p>Coffea staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in panicles, and it produces berries that contain the seeds used for coffee.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production due to its low yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
