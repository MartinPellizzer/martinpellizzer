                    <h1>Carex dioica var. subtriangularis</h1>
<p>Carex dioica var. subtriangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial sedge characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, which are separated into distinct spikelets. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture, while the stems are often reddish-brown in color.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
