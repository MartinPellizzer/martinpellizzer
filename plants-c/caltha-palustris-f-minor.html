                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. minor</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist meadows in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is smaller than the typical Caltha palustris, with shorter stems and smaller flowers.</p>
