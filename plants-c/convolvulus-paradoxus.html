<p>Convolvulus paradoxus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a sprawling annual herb with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are encased in a tough, spiny capsule that aids in dispersal by attachment to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Convolvulus paradoxus is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
