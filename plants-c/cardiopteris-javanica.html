<p>Cardiopteris javanica, commonly known as the Java shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a shield-shaped base and delicate, lanceolate pinnae. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cardiopteris javanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
