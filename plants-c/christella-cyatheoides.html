                    <h1>Christella cyatheoides</h1>
<p>Christella cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a large, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown to blackish layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that develop on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
