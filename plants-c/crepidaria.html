                    <h1>Crepidaria</h1>
<p>Crepidaria, commonly known as the "velvet leaf" or "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, often hairy leaves. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant a soft texture. Crepidaria species are native to regions in southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle floral display to their foliage.</p>
