                    <h1>Caralluma ruschiana</h1>
<p>Caralluma ruschiana, commonly known as the Desert Cucumber, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and the stems are covered in a waxy coating to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma ruschiana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
