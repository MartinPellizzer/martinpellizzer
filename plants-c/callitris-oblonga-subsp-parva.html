<p>Callitris oblonga subsp.</p>
<p>parva, commonly known as the small-leaf white cypress, is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage that forms a compact, rounded crown.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
