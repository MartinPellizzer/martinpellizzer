<p>Conomorpha verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate structure.</p>
<p>Conomorpha verticillata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
