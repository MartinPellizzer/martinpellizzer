<p>Chaetospora cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes fine, hair-like structures called setae, which aid in attachment and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Chaetospora cuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing microhabitats for various microscopic life forms.</p>
