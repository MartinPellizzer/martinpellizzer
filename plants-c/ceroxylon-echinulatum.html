                    <h1>Ceroxylon echinulatum</h1>
<p>Ceroxylon echinulatum, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, waxy coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its woody structure and evergreen nature make it well adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Ceroxylon echinulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in cooler regions for its unique appearance.</p>
