                    <h1>Cyclosorus brevipes</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus brevipes plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
