                    <h1>Cynorkis elephantina</h1>
<p>Cynorkis elephantina, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large, herbivorous mollusk native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its thick, spiral-shaped shell and soft, fleshy body. The plant-like appearance of its shell gives it a deceptive resemblance to certain flowering plants. While not a true plant, it plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid reproduction and potential to become invasive, it is often considered a pest in non-native regions.</p>
