<p>Cyathea villosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea villosa typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to grow in humid conditions make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
