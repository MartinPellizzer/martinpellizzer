                    <h1>Cypellium</h1>
<p>Cypellium, commonly known as the "false sunflower," is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, giving it a sunflower-like appearance. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cypellium species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
