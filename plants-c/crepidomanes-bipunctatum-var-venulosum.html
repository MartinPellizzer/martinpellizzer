                    <h1>Crepidomanes bipunctatum var. venulosum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes bipunctatum var. venulosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or root in moist soil. Its leaves are usually small and often modified into specialized bladders for capturing prey.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'venulosum' refers to the distinct vein patterns on its leaves, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
