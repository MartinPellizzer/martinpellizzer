<p>String of hearts, scientifically known as Ceropegia sharpei subsp. ciliata, is a popular trailing plant cherished for its heart-shaped leaves that cascade elegantly from hanging baskets. Native to South Africa, this plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a favorite among indoor gardeners and plant enthusiasts. Despite its delicate look, it is resilient and can adapt to various growing conditions with proper care. Whether placed on a windowsill or hung in a corner, the String of hearts adds a touch of beauty and tranquility to any space.</p>
