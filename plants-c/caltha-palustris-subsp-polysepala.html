<p>Caltha palustris subsp.</p>
<p>polysepala, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in northern regions. It features showy yellow flowers with numerous sepals that give it a distinctive, almost daisy-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant has smooth, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and damp woodlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland habitats and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
