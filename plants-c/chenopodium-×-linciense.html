                    <h1>Chenopodium × linciense</h1>
<p>Chenopodium × linciense, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and production of dry, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often becoming a dominant species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its common name comes from its tendency to roll up into a ball when mature, facilitating seed dispersal by wind.</p>
