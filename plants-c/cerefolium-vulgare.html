<p>Cerefolium vulgare, commonly known as common cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces legume pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Cerefolium vulgare plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
