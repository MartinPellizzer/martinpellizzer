                    <h1>Chelonanthus uliginosus</h1>
<p>Chelonanthus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of flowering and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
