                    <h1>Colletia spinosa</h1>
<p>Colletia spinosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and oval, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Colletia spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
