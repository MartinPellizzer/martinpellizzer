                    <h1>Crepidium floscularium</h1>
<p>Crepidium floscularium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, typically in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique morphology, with a slender, hairless stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.</p>
