                    <h1>Cyperus persicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus persicus, commonly known as Persian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus persicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
