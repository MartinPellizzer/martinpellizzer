                    <h1>Cyclosorus × linii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × linii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus linii.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
