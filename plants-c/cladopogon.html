                    <h1>Cladopogon</h1>
<p>Cladopogon, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Cladopogon species are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They often form dense mats or low shrubs, which help prevent soil erosion in their native habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in restoration ecology due to their resilience and adaptability.</p>
