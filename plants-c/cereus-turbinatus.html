<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cereus turbinatus is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
