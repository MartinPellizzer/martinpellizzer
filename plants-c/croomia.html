<p>Croomia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, arching foliage with serrated, lance-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year.

<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
