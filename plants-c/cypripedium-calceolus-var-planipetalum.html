                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. planipetalum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. planipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators, which plays a crucial role in its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential for its survival.</p>
