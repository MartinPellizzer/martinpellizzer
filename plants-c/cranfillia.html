                    <h1>Cranfillia</h1>
<p>Cranfillia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, upright stem with clusters of small, white blooms that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. Cranfillia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
