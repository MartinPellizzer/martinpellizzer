                    <h1>Corylus × colurnoides</h1>
<p>Corylus × colurnoides, commonly known as the hazelnut hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between *Corylus americana* (beaked hazelnut) and *Corylus cornuta* (cownut), exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a cupule, which is a modified leaf structure typical of the Corylus genus. Its foliage consists of alternate, simple leaves with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Corylus × colurnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
