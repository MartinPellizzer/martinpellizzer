                    <h1>Caulobryon</h1>
<p>Caulobryon, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of thalloid structures, which are flat, ribbon-like bodies that grow close to the ground. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. Caulobryon typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are often found on the thallus surface, facilitating sexual reproduction.</p>
