<p>Ceratophyllum submersum var. manschuricum, commonly known as the dwarf water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are often clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light levels.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become a nuisance in ponds and lakes if not managed properly.</p>
