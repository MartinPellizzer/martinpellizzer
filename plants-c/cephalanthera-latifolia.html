                    <h1>Cephalanthera latifolia</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a loose spiral along the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera latifolia is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
