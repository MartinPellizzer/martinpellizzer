                            <h1>Crepis Polymorpha Var. Virens</h1>
<p>Field mouse-ear, scientifically known as Crepis polymorpha var. virens, is a common flowering plant found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be seen growing along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its name likely comes from its resemblance to the ears of a mouse, though its exact origin remains uncertain. Despite its modest appearance, Field mouse-ear plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its environment.</p>
