                    <h1>Cyperus aegyptiacus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus aegyptiacus is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a natural water filter in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
