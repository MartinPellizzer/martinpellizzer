<p>Comesperma kunthianum, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Comesperma kunthianum is well adapted to xeric conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
