                    <h1>Coffea magnoliifolia</h1>
<p>Coffea magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia coffee or the white-flowered coffee, is a unique species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, red berries containing the coffee beans.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited cultivation, it is less known than other coffee species like Coffea arabica or Coffea canephora.</p>
