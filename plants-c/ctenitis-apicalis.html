                    <h1>Ctenitis apicalis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis apicalis, commonly known as the apical ctenophyll, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Ctenophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure and the presence of ctenophore-like structures, which are specialized for locomotion. This plant thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are typically located at the tips of its branches, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Ctenitis apicalis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
