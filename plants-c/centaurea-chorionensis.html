                    <h1>Centaurea chorionensis</h1>
<p>Centaurea chorionensis, commonly known as the Cyprus star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the island of Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical features of the genus Centaurea. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in parts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
