                    <h1>Cordia megiae</h1>
<p>Cordia megiae, commonly known as the white cordia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and mangrove habitats. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
