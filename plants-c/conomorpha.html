                    <h1>Conomorpha</h1>
<p>Conomorpha, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Conomorpha species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental beauty.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
