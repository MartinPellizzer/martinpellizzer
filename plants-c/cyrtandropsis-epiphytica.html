                    <h1>Cyrtandropsis epiphytica</h1>
<p>Cyrtandropsis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic shrub, is a rare and specialized plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink. Its botanical structure is adapted to its unique lifestyle, with specialized root systems that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
