<p>Cephalangraecum cephalotes, commonly known as the Cape Verdean star cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, branching cactus with distinctive, star-shaped spines and tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
