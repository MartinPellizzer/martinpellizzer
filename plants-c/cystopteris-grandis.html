<p>Cystopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped structure at the base of its fronds, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
