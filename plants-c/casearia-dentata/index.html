                            <h1>Casearia Dentata</h1>
<p>Casearia dentata is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is known for its delicate, opposite leaves that are often toothed or serrated, giving it its scientific name. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its visual charm. Despite its modest size, Casearia dentata plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
