<p>Carex nubens, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Carex nubens is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
