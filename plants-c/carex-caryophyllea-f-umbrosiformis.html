The plant produces small, clustered brownish flowers in late summer, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream edges.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its ability to add texture and contrast to shaded garden spaces.</p>
