                    <h1>Crypsis dura</h1>
<p>Crypsis dura, commonly known as the hard crypt, is a rare and resilient plant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's leaves are typically small and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy features.</p>
<p>Despite its unassuming appearance, Crypsis dura plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local microfauna.</p>
