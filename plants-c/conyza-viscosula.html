<p>Conyza viscosula, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its sticky secretions may play a role in deterring herbivores and aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
