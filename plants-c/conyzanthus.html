<p>Conyzanthus, commonly known as the blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a circular pattern. Conyzanthus species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They produce small, often blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are invasive in certain regions.</p>
