<p>Cynara humilis var. reflexa, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a cluster, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
