<p>Centaurea micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bristly, spiny seed heads that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Centaurea micrantha is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas.</p>
