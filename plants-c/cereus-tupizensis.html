                    <h1>Cereus tupizensis</h1>
<p>Cereus tupizensis, commonly known as the Tupi night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cereus tupizensis is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
