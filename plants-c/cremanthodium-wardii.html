<p>Cremanthodium wardii, commonly known as the Ward's ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
