                    <h1>Chaetospora diodon</h1>
<p>Chaetospora diodon, commonly known as the spiny star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, scale-like leaves with a distinctive spiny appearance, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in rocky or soil substrates and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying bryophyte diversity.</p>
