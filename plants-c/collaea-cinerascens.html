<p>Collaea cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray to ash-colored thallus, which is typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>Collaea cinerascens plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
