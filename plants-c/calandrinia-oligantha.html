                    <h1>Calandrinia oligantha</h1>
<p>Calandrinia oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calandrinia oligantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and colorful blooms.</p>
