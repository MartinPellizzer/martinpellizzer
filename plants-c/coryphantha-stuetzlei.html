                    <h1>Coryphantha stuetzlei</h1>
<p>Coryphantha stuetzlei, commonly known as the Stuetzlei's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rounded stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Coryphantha stuetzlei is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, photosynthetic tissue.</p>
