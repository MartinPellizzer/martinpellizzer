                    <h1>Callicoma stutzeri f. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Callicoma stutzeri f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-fruited hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, often clustered inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pink or red, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other forms of the species.</p>
