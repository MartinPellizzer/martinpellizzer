                    <h1>Carex rupestris</h1>
<p>Carex rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environments, such as cliffs and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
<p>Carex rupestris plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
