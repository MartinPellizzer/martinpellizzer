<p>Cyrta finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves and stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
