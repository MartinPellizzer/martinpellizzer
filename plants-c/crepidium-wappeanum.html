<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its inflorescence produces a cluster of small, intricate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
