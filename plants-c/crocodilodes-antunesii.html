The plant typically exhibits a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, much about its biology and conservation status remains unknown.</p>
