                    <h1>Codonopsis accrescenticalyx</h1>
<p>Codonopsis accrescenticalyx, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Codonopsis accrescenticalyx is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
