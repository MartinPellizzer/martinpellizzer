                    <h1>Carex dioica var. davalliana</h1>
<p>Carex dioica var. davalliana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it has separate male and female flowers on different stems, a feature known as dioecy. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
