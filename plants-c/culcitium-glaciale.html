                    <h1>Culcitium glaciale</h1>
<p>Culcitium glaciale, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a hardy perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Culcitium glaciale plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
