<p>Calderonella, commonly known as the Mexican fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Calderonella is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
