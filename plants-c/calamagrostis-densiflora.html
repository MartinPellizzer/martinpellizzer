                    <h1>Calamagrostis densiflora</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis densiflora, commonly known as denseflower reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender culms that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with dense clusters of spikelets along the stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, adding visual interest in late summer and autumn. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis densiflora is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
