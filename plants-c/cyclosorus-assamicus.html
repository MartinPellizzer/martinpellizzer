<p>Cyclosorus assamicus, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus assamicus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
