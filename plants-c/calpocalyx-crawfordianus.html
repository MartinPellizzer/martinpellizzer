<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect light. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink, emitting a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
