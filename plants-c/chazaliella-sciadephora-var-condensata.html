                    <h1>Chazaliella sciadephora var. condensata</h1>
<p>Chazaliella sciadephora var. condensata, commonly known as the dense chazaliella, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
