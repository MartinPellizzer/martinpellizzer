                    <h1>Cactus caronatus</h1>
<p>Cactus caronatus, commonly known as the yellow-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are often pollinated by nocturnal insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
