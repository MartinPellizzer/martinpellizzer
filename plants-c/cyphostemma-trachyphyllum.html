<p>Cyphostemma trachyphyllum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and is often used as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Cyphostemma trachyphyllum is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
