<p>Calpandria, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble cups, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Calpandria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ecological value in wetland restoration projects.</p>
