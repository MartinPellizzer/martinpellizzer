<p>Castilleja ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
