<p>Chieniopteris harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
