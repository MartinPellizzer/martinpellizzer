<p>It is characterized by its slender, pinkish-green stems and delicate, spider-like flowers that range from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short-lived, fleshy rhizome and produces its showy blooms during the cooler months of spring and autumn.</p>
