                    <h1>Cuscuta globosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta globosa, commonly known as the globeflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants before establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
