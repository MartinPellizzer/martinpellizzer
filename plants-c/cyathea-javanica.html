<p>Cyathea javanica, commonly known as the Java tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and can grow up to several meters in height. Cyathea javanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
