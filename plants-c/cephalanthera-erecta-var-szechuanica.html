                    <h1>Cephalanthera erecta var. szechuanica</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera erecta var. szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a tall, unbranched stem that bears numerous showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. The plant is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves and a lack of true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
