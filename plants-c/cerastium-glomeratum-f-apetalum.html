                    <h1>Cerastium glomeratum f. apetalum</h1>
<p>Cerastium glomeratum f. apetalum, commonly known as the pink snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth habit, with hairy, succulent stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are notable for their lack of petals, which is reflected in its scientific name, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates.</p>
