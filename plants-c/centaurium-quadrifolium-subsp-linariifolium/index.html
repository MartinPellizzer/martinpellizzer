                            <h1>Centaurium Quadrifolium Subsp. Linariifolium</h1>
<p>Centaurium quadrifolium subsp. linariifolium is a lesser-known member of the gentian family known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are characterized by their four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in botanical studies. This plant offers unique insights into the diversity within the Centaurium genus.</p>
