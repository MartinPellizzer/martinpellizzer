                    <h1>Calamagrostis littorea var. laxa</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis littorea var. laxa, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its flowering spikes are typically pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to high salinity and frequent flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
