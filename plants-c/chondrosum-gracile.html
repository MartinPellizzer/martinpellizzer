                    <h1>Chondrosum gracile</h1>
<p>Chondrosum gracile, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its succulent leaves help store water, and it often grows in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Chondrosum gracile plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
