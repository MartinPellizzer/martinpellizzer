                    <h1>Cecropia telenivea</h1>
<p>Cecropia telenivea, commonly known as the white-veined cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cecropiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with Azobacter bacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its hollow stems and rapid growth make it a common component of secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to support a variety of epiphytic plants and insects.</p>
