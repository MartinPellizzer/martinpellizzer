                    <h1>Cecropia bracteata</h1>
<p>Cecropia bracteata, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in disturbed habitats such as clearings and along roadsides. It has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it an important component of secondary forests and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
