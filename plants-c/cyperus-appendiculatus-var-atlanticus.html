                    <h1>Cyperus appendiculatus var. atlanticus</h1>
<p>Cyperus appendiculatus var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
