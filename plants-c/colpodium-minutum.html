<p>Colpodium minutum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Colpodium minutum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from trapping prey.</p>
