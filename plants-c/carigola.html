                    <h1>Carigola</h1>
<p>Carigola, commonly known as *Carpenteria americana*, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Carigola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
