                    <h1>Cardamine robusta</h1>
<p>Cardamine robusta, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress, though it is less commonly cultivated than its relatives.</p>
