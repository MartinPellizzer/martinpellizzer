                    <h1>Caroxylon campylopterum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon campylopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Caroxylon campylopterum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
