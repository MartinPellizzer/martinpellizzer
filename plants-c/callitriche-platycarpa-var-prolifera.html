                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa var. prolifera</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. prolifera, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its fruits are berry-like structures that disperse seeds through water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for clean water, it is often used as an indicator of water quality.</p>
