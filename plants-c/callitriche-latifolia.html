<p>Callitriche latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Callitriche latifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth.</p>
