<p>Cephalanthera calcarata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling inflorescence of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found on limestone soils. It produces a single, elongated, club-shaped pseudobulb that stores nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
