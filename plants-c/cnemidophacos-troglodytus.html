<p>Cnemidophacos troglodytus, commonly known as the cave barnacle, is a calcareous organism that thrives in marine and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scalpellidae and is characterized by its small, shell-like body covered in fine, calcareous plates. This species is often found attached to rocks, shells, or other substrates in intertidal zones. Its morphology includes a short, conical stem and a cup-like base that anchors it to surfaces.</p>
