<p>Clinelymus borealis, commonly known as the northern pinyon, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It has compact, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Clinelymus borealis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and resilience make it a key component of polar ecosystems.</p>
