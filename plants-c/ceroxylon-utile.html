                    <h1>Ceroxylon utile</h1>
<p>Ceroxylon utile, commonly known as the wax palm, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions like Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a thick layer of wax-like substance, which provides protection against environmental stressors. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length, making it a distinctive feature of its habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the top of the plant, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, Ceroxylon utile is also considered a symbol of national identity in some Caribbean countries.</p>
