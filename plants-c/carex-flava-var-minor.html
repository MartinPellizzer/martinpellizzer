                    <h1>Carex flava var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex flava var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often yellow-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
