                    <h1>Cactus haageanus</h1>
<p>Cactus haageanus, commonly known as the Hager's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rainfall.</p>
<p>Cactus haageanus is well-suited to xerophytic environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
