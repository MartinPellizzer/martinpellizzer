                    <h1>Chamaecrista desvauxii var. circumdata</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista desvauxii var. circumdata, commonly known as the creeping crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow,蝶形花 (butterfly-shaped) flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>It is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
