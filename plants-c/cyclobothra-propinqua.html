                    <h1>Cyclobothra propinqua</h1>
<p>Cyclobothra propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
