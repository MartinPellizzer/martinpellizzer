<p>Cheilanthes arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This resilient fern is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky crevices and cliffs.</p>
