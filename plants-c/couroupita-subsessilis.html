                    <h1>Couroupita subsessilis</h1>
<p>Couroupita subsessilis, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mucronata*, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes aerial pneumatophores that help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Couroupita subsessilis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
