                    <h1>Croton ricinocarpus</h1>
<p>Croton ricinocarpus, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a significant concern for livestock and humans. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings.</p>
