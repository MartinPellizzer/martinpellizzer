                    <h1>Carlina lanata var. monocephala</h1>
<p>Carlina lanata var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed woolly cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and often forms dense mats, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its single, terminal flower head, setting it apart from other Carlina species.</p>
