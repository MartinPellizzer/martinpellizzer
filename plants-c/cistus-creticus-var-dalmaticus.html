<p>Cistus creticus var. dalmaticus, commonly known as the Dalmatian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Croatia and other parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, thriving in full sun and dry conditions. It has aromatic leaves that release a strong scent when crushed, a trait shared with other members of the rockrose genus.</p>
