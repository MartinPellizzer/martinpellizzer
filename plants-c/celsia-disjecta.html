                    <h1>Celsia disjecta</h1>
<p>Celsia disjecta, commonly known as the scattered celsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its unique growth habit involves producing flowers at the base of the plant, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia disjecta is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
