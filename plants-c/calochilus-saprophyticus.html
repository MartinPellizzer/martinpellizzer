                    <h1>Calochilus saprophyticus</h1>
<p>Calochilus saprophyticus, commonly known as the saprophytic orchid, is a unique species of orchid that exhibits saprophytic growth habits.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on decomposing organic matter for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. This orchid is typically found in shaded, moist forest floors where it forms symbiotic relationships with fungi. Its flowers are often small and inconspicuous, with a range of colors from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive plant in its native habitat.</p>
