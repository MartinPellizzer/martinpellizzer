                    <h1>Ceratoides papposa</h1>
<p>Ceratoides papposa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its seed heads are covered in fine, silky hairs, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
