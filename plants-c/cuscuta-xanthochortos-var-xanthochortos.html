                    <h1>Cuscuta xanthochortos var. xanthochortos</h1>
<p>Cuscuta xanthochortos var. xanthochortos, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Australia and is often found on shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
