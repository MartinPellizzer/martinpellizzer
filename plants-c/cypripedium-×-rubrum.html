                    <h1>Cypripedium × rubrum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. It produces showy flowers in late spring to early summer, and its growth is often slow, requiring several years to reach maturity.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
