<p>Cedrela cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban cedar, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>Cedrela cubensis also produces elongated, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind.</p>
