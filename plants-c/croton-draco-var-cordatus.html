                    <h1>Croton draco var. cordatus</h1>
<p>Croton draco var. cordatus, commonly known as the Dracocephalum croton, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a dragon's head.</p>
<p>Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by ornamental, woody fruits. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
