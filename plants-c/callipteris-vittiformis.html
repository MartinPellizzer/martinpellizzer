                    <h1>Callipteris vittiformis</h1>
<p>Callipteris vittiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea oats, is a coastal grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline and is adapted to salt spray and high wind exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct white stripe running along the midrib, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal, contributing to its ability to colonize beach environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
