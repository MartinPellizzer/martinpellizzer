                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa f. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, often calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are elongated siliques containing several seeds, typical of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in slow-moving streams and wet meadows, contributing to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
