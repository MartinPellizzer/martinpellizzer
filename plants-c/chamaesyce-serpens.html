                    <h1>Chamaesyce serpens</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce serpens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
