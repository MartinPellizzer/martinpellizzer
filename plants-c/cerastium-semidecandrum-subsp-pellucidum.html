<p>Cerastium semidecandrum subsp.</p>
<p>pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and possesses a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
