                    <h1>Calamagrostis arundinacea var. alpina</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis arundinacea var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-blue in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, feathery texture to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that provide structure and texture in garden designs.</p>
