                    <h1>Coincya mariolensis</h1>
<p>Coincya mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensis water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the water surface in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coincya mariolensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
