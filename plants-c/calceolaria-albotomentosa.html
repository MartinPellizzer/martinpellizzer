                    <h1>Calceolaria albotomentosa</h1>
<p>Calceolaria albotomentosa, commonly known as the white-tomentose slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. It blooms in the spring and early summer, producing delicate, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Calceolaria albotomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
