<p>Chromatopogon jacquinii, commonly known as the golden panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, golden-yellow flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
