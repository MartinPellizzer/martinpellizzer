                    <h1>Citrus medicolimonum</h1>
<p>Citrus medicolimonum, commonly known as the desert lime or Christ's lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, round, green fruits that are typically harvested when they are still unripe and acidic. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with succulent leaves and a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil. Its fruit contains high levels of vitamin C and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience makes it an important species for reforestation and sustainable agriculture in dry climates.</p>
