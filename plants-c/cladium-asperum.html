                    <h1>Cladium asperum</h1>
<p>Cladium asperum, commonly known as the rough sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, stiff, and often hairy leaf blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Cladium asperum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
