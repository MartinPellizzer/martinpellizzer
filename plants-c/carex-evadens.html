<p>Carex evadens, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which are typical features of sedges. Native to North America, this plant thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-angled berries, aiding in its propagation.</p>
