                    <h1>Coelogyne laotica</h1>
<p>Coelogyne laotica, commonly known as the Laotian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 10, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery layer, which helps it store water.</p>
<p>Coelogyne laotica prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
