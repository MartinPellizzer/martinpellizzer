                    <h1>Cycas arnhemica</h1>
<p>Cycas arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Cycas arnhemica is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
