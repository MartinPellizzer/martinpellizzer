                    <h1>Cypripedium × tessellatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × tessellatum, commonly known as the tessellated lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped pouch that is often adorned with intricate patterns of green and brown. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cypripedium × tessellatum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
