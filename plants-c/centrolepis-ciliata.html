<p>Centrolepis ciliata, commonly known as the coastal centrolepis, is a unique plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, tufted foliage and distinctive, cylindrical stems. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Centrolepis ciliata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
