                    <h1>Cranichis sylvatica</h1>
<p>Cranichis sylvatica, commonly known as the wood orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a short root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flower is usually pink or purple with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
