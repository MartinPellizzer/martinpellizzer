<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous white flowers. The plant relies on a network of roots to attach to host trees, from which it derives some of its nutrients. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain insect species and birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation areas.</p>
