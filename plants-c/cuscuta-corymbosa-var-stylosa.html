<p>Cuscuta corymbosa var. stylosa, commonly known as the long-styled dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, and the variety is distinguished by its elongated stamens.</p>
<p>This species is native to various regions in North America and is considered an invasive weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
