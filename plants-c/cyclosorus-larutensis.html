                    <h1>Cyclosorus larutensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus larutensis, commonly known as the Larut water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
