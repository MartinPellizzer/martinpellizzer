                    <h1>Cirsium scariosum var. scariosum</h1>
<p>Cirsium scariosum var. scariosum, commonly known as the scaly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
