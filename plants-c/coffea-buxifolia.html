<p>Coffea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf coffee.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, glossy leaves resembling those of boxwood. It produces small white flowers that give way to red berries containing seeds used for coffee production.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited cultivation, it is less commonly found in commercial coffee markets compared to other Coffea species.</p>
