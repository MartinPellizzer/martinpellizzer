                    <h1>Cuscuta schkuhriana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta schkuhriana, commonly known as the Schkuhriana dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant and extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the wind, allowing it to colonize new host plants efficiently.</p>
