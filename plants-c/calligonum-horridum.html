<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and rough, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought.</p>
<p>Its structure provides habitat and erosion control in sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
