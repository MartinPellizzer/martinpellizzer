<p>Calonyction diversifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Calonyction diversifolium thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and maximize sunlight absorption.</p>
