<p>Chrysopogon collinus, commonly known as the mountain grass or hillside grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion in its native environment.</p>
<p>Chrysopogon collinus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
