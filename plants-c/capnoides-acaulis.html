<p>Capnoides acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed capnoid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its lack of a true stem, with leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Capnoides acaulis thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
