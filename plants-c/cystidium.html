<p>Cystidium, commonly known as the "cystidium plant," is a unique type of plant structure found in certain species of algae and fungi.</p>
<p>It refers to a specialized cell or group of cells that form a protective covering or a specialized structure. These cystidia are often involved in defense mechanisms, such as trapping prey or deterring herbivores. They can be found in various forms, including elongated or branched structures.</p>
<p>The presence and morphology of cystidia are important characteristics used in the classification of certain plant-like organisms.</p>
