<p>Chrysocoma dichotoma, commonly known as the silver cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a rosette form, with leaves arranged in a compact, circular pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
