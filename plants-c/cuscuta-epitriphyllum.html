                    <h1>Cuscuta epitriphyllum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epitriphyllum, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, and it can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the host plant.</p>
<p>Cuscuta epitriphyllum is found in temperate regions and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
