<p>Calycodendron rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a distinctive reddish hue, especially during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural wild state.</p>
