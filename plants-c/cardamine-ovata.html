                    <h1>Cardamine ovata</h1>
<p>Cardamine ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland floors where it can access the moisture it requires.</p>
<p>Cardamine ovata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
