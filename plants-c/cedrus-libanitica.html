                    <h1>Cedrus libanitica</h1>
<p>Cedrus libanitica, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green foliage, and distinctive, flaky bark that peels in thin, reddish strips. The tree produces large, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Lebanon cedar is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical significance in ancient architecture and religious symbolism.</p>
