                    <h1>Cyperus eglobosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus eglobosus, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus eglobosus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various aquatic conditions.</p>
