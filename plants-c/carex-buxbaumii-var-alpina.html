                    <h1>Carex buxbaumii var. alpina</h1>
<p>Carex buxbaumii var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
