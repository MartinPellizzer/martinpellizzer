                    <h1>Cynodon nlemfuensis var. robustus</h1>
<p>Cynodon nlemfuensis var. robustus, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, stiff blades and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for grazing and erosion control. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and grasslands. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand heavy grazing.</p>
