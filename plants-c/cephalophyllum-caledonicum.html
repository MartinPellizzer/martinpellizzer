                    <h1>Cephalophyllum caledonicum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum caledonicum, commonly known as the Caledonian headplant, is a unique succulent native to the mountainous regions of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, often spiny leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the rocky soil where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
