                    <h1>Cuscuta macrocephala</h1>
<p>Cuscuta macrocephala, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
