<p>Cyclosorus goedenii, commonly known as the Goeden's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its intricate, floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its small, white flowers are borne on short stalks and are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
