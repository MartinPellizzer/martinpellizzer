<p>Capparis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf caper, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, lemon-scented fruits. Its roots are known to have medicinal properties, used traditionally for their anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.</p>
<p>Capparis humilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
