                    <h1>Cousinia bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Cousinia bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Karakoram cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold, wind, and limited soil nutrients. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Cousinia bornmuelleri plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its alpine habitat.</p>
