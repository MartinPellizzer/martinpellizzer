                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. tripinnata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. tripinnata, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate and fern-like plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically light green and somewhat translucent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate or tripinnate, giving it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
