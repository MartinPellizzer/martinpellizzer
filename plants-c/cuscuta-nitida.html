                    <h1>Cuscuta nitida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
