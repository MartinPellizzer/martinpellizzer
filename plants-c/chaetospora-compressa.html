<p>Chaetospora compressa, commonly known as the compressed spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, compact growth form with a dark green color and closely packed leaves that are often slightly curved.
