<p>Chirocalyx abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian chirocalyx, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
