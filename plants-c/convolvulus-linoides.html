                    <h1>Convolvulus linoides</h1>
<p>Convolvulus linoides, commonly known as the sand bur or desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bur-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture adapted to hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Convolvulus linoides is often found in sandy soils and can be invasive in some regions.</p>
