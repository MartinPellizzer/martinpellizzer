                    <h1>Cerastium oxalidiflorum</h1>
<p>Cerastium oxalidiflorum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to both the genus Cerastium and the flower structure of Oxalis species.</p>
