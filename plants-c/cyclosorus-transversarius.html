                    <h1>Cyclosorus transversarius</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus transversarius, commonly known as the transverse waterwheel, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus transversarius plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental aquatic gardening.</p>
