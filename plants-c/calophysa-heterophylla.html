                    <h1>Calophysa heterophylla</h1>
<p>Calophysa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on the environmental conditions. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to adapt its morphology makes it a fascinating subject in the study of bryophyte morphology and ecology.</p>
