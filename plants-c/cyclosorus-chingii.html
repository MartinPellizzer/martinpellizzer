                    <h1>Cyclosorus chingii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus chingii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
