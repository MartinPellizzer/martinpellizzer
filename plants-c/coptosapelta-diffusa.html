<p>Coptosapelta diffusa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorus. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Coptosapelta diffusa is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
