It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is often seen floating on the surface or attached to submerged surfaces. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense blooms under favorable conditions. Despite its simple structure, it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for various organisms. Its presence can also indicate changes in water quality and environmental health.</p>
