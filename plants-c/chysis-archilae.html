<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces pale green to white blooms that appear during the spring and early summer.</p>
