<p>Carex alpestris var. tripla, commonly known as the alpine three-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows, tundra, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
