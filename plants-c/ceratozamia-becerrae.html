<p>Ceratozamia becerrae, commonly known as the Berrera's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Guanajuato and Hidalgo. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem with a rough, fibrous bark and large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery. Its cones are dioecious, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, and it produces both pollen and seed cones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Ceratozamia becerrae is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its evolutionary and ecological importance.</p>
