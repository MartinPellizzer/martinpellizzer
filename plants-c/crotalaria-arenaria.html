                    <h1>Crotalaria arenaria</h1>
<p>Crotalaria arenaria, commonly known as sand flatpea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Crotalaria arenaria is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
