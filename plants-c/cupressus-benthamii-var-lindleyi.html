                    <h1>Cupressus benthamii var. lindleyi</h1>
<p>Cupressus benthamii var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's lacebark, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flaky, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones and has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.</p>
