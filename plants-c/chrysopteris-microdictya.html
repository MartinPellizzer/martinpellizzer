<p>Chrysopteris microdictya, commonly known as the golden mist fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden dust, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
