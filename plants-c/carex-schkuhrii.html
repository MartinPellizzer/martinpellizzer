                    <h1>Carex schkuhrii</h1>
<p>Carex schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhrii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. The plant produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Carex schkuhrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in cold climate ecosystems.</p>
