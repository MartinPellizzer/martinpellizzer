                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe cochleata</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe cochleata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features creeping rhizomes that give rise to fiddlehead-like fronds, which unfurl into lanceolate, leathery leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Crocodeilanthe cochleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
