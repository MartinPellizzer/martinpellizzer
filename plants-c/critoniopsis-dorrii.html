                    <h1>Critoniopsis dorrii</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis dorrii, commonly known as the Dorrii's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It produces pale yellow or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, often in response to brief periods of rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Critoniopsis dorrii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
