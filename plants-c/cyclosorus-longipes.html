<p>Cyclosorus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around its elongated stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by the development of fruiting structures. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
