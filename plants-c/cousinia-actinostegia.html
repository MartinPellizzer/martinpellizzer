                    <h1>Cousinia actinostegia</h1>
<p>Cousinia actinostegia, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia actinostegia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
