                    <h1>Ctenitis mearnsii</h1>
<p>Ctenitis mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' rockfern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis mearnsii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
