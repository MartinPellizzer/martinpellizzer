                    <h1>Cactus megacanthus</h1>
<p>Cactus megacanthus, commonly known as the giant saguaro, is a towering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 50 feet in height, with a distinctive branching pattern that resembles an umbrella. The plant stores large amounts of water in its succulent stems, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bats and birds.</p>
<p>The saguaro is an important ecological keystone species, providing habitat and food for numerous desert animals.</p>
