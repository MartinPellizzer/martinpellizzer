<p>Cyclosorus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus ciliatus plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
