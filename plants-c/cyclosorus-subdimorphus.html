<p>Cyclosorus subdimorphus, commonly known as the two-formed water moss, is a species of freshwater algae belonging to the order Desmoidales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells that exhibit dimorphism, meaning they have two distinct forms along the thallus. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its microscopic structure includes a central axis with branching filaments, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms.</p>
