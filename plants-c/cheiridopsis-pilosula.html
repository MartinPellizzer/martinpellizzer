                    <h1>Cheiridopsis pilosula</h1>
<p>Cheiridopsis pilosula, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for water-wise gardening.</p>
