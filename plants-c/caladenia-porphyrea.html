<p>Caladenia porphyrea, commonly known as the Purple-veined Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its distinctive, spider-like flowers with a deep purple and white coloration. The plant typically blooms during the autumn season, producing intricate, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects.
