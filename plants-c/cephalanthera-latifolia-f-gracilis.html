                    <h1>Cephalanthera latifolia f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera latifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clusters of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
