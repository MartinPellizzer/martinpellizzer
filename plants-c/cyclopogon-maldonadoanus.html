<p>Cyclopogon maldonadoanus, commonly known as the Maldonado's cyclopogon, is a rare and unique bromeliad native to the humid lowland forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, creating a small water-holding cup. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on bromeliad diversity and adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
