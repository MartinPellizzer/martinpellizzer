<p>Cereus engelmannii var. pfersdorffii, commonly known as the Engelmann's night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
