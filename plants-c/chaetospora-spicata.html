<p>Chaetospora spicata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a leafy shoot system with small, spirally arranged leaves that are often clustered at the tips of short, branching stems. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores in specialized capsules, which are borne on stalks at the ends of the leaves.</p>
<p>Chaetospora spicata plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
