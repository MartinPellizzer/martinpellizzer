                    <h1>Citrus × koozi</h1>
<p>Citrus × koozi, commonly known as the koozi lime, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from the intersection of the kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix) and the lemon (Citrus limon).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic fruits with a distinctive bumpy, greenish-yellow rind and a high concentration of essential oils. The leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly serrated edge, typical of many citrus species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is widely cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in culinary and aromatic applications.</p>
