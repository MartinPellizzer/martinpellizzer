                    <h1>Carex macrorrhiza var. simplex</h1>
<p>Carex macrorrhiza var. simplex, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grow in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its simpler, less branched structure compared to other Carex species.</p>
