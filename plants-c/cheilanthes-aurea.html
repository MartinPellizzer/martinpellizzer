<p>Cheilanthes aurea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its deep root system and drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which contribute to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
