                    <h1>Cousinia arctioides</h1>
<p>Cousinia arctioides, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh, cold climates with its low, compact form. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia arctioides produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
