                    <h1>Cuscuta rojasii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rojasii, commonly known as the Rosas' dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly specialized root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States. It is often found growing on shrubs and grasses, forming dense mats that can negatively impact its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Cuscuta rojasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
