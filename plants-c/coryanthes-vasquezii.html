                    <h1>Coryanthes vasquezii</h1>
<p>Coryanthes vasquezii, commonly known as the VÃ¡squez's orchid, is a rare and striking tropical orchid native to the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often intricate floral structures, which are adapted for specific pollination by birds or insects. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers exhibit a unique morphology with specialized shapes and colors that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
