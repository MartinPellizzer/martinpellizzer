                    <h1>Cuscuta rustica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rustica, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. It can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds, all without photosynthesis.</p>
