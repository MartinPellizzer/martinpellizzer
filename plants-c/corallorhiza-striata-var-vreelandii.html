                    <h1>Corallorhiza striata var. vreelandii</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza striata var. vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland's coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph.</p>
<p>This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, often forming symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a rosette of fleshy, reddish-brown leaves and produces showy, red or orange flowers. The species is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range.</p>
