<p>Cousinia calocephala subsp.</p>
<p>behboudiana, commonly known as the Persian sand-rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
