<p>Castilleja ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants.</p>
<p>Castilleja ortegae is an important component of its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of arid and semi-arid habitats.</p>
