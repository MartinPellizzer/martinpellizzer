                <h1>Campanula scheuchzeri</h1>
<p>Campanula scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude environment. Campanula scheuchzeri is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
