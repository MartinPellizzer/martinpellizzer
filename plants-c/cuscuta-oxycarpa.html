                    <h1>Cuscuta oxycarpa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-fruited dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and subsequent growth. The plant's stems are often covered in tiny, sticky structures that help it adhere to its host. It is native to various regions in the Americas and can be found on a wide range of host species, including crops and wild plants.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is significant, as it can reduce the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
