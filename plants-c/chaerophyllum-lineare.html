                    <h1>Chaerophyllum lineare</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to toxic species, it is often mistaken for other hogweeds and requires careful identification.</p>
