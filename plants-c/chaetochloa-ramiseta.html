<p>Chaetochloa ramiseta, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in moist habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms highlights its ecological significance.</p>
