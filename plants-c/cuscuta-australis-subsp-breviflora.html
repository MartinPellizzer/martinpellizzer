<p>Cuscuta australis subsp.</p>
<p>breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems.</p>
<p>The plant is native to Australia and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
