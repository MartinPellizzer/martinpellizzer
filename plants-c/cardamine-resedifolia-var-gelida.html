                    <h1>Cardamine resedifolia var. gelida</h1>
<p>Cardamine resedifolia var. gelida, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in cold, clear waters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
