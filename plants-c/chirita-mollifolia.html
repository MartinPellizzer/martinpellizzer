                    <h1>Chirita mollifolia</h1>
<p>Chirita mollifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf or creeping chireta, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from spring to early autumn. Its fibrous roots and rhizomatous growth habit allow it to spread easily, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Chirita mollifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
