                    <h1>Catha edulis</h1>
<p>Catha edulis, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is distinct in its chemical composition. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, which contain psychoactive compounds such as cathinone and cathine. These substances act as stimulants, affecting the central nervous system and leading to increased alertness and euphoria.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, Catha edulis is regulated in many countries despite its traditional use in social and cultural contexts.</p>
