<p>Cusparia gaudichaudiaua, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
