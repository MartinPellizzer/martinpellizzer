<p>Calamagrostis deserticola var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned desert grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing feathery, bristly florets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
