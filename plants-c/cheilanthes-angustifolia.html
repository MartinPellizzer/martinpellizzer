                    <h1>Cheilanthes angustifolia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found on cliffs, slopes, and in crevices where it can retain moisture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes angustifolia is a hardy species that is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
