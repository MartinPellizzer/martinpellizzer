<p>Cheilanthes recurvata, commonly known as the curling rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive curling appearance, especially when young. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, making it a common sight in desert landscapes.</p>
