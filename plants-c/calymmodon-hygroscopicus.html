                    <h1>Calymmodon hygroscopicus</h1>
<p>Calymmodon hygroscopicus, commonly known as the moisture-sensitive fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its ability to respond to changes in humidity.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are delicate and tend to curl or fold when exposed to dry conditions, a trait that helps it conserve moisture. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptive strategies to thrive in fluctuating environmental conditions.</p>
