<p>Cirsium floccosum, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of soft, white flocculent hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Cirsium floccosum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
