                    <h1>Cycas collina</h1>
<p>Cycas collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, linear leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the plant. Cycas collina is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and its resemblance to prehistoric plant species.</p>
