                    <h1>Chloropyron palustre</h1>
<p>Chloropyron palustre, commonly known as bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, often boggy environments.</p>
<p>Chloropyron palustre plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
