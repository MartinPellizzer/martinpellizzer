                    <h1>Cirsium callilepis var. pseudocarlinoides</h1>
<p>Cirsium callilepis var. pseudocarlinoides, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features spiny, gray-green leaves with a rough texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by dense, bristly foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other thistle species within the Cirsium genus, sharing similar structural and ecological characteristics.</p>
