<p>Chloanthes coccinea, commonly known as the red spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems and produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily flies, due to their unique coloration and scent.</p>
<p>The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
