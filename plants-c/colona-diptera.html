                    <h1>Colona diptera</h1>
<p>Colona diptera, commonly known as the common green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive eye structure. The plant is not a botanical entity but an animal, specifically an insect, so it does not have botanical aspects. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
