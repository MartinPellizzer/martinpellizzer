<p>Coccomelia racemosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a globular, succulent stem that stores water, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer. Its leaves are fleshy and alternate, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Coccomelia racemosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dryland ecosystems.</p>
