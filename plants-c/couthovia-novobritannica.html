<p>Couthovia novobritannica, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of New Britannia.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, aiding in water conservation in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and violet, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a toxic berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
