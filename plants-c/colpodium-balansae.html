<p>Colpodium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It has a simple morphology with filamentous stems and no true roots.</p>
<p>Colpodium balansae is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
