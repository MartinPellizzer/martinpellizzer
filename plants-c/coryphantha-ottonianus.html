                    <h1>Coryphantha ottonianus</h1>
<p>Coryphantha ottonianus, commonly known as the Otto's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often branched. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a typical adaptation for water conservation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha ottonianus is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
