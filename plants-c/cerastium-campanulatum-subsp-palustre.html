<p>Cerastium campanulatum subsp.</p>
<p>palustre, commonly known as marsh chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in damp environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological role in wetland ecosystems make it an important plant for biodiversity.</p>
