<p>Crepis alpicola, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
