                    <h1>Carya pallida var. pyriformis</h1>
<p>Carya pallida var. pyriformis, commonly known as the white hickory or oval hickory, is a rare variant of the white hickory species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the typical white hickory. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in catkins, followed by hard, woody fruits that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
