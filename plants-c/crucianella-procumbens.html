                    <h1>Crucianella procumbens</h1>
<p>Crucianella procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sea bean, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained environments. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or greenish, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize dunes, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
