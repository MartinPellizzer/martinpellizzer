                    <h1>Chorisis repens</h1>
<p>Chorisis repens, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals and is characterized by its spreading growth habit through rhizomes and stolons. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the plant produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
