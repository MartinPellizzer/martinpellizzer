<p>Conophytum ovatum, commonly known as the "Lemon Tree" or "Cape Lemon," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Conophytum ovatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
