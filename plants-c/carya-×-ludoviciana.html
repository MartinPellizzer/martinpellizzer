                    <h1>Carya × ludoviciana</h1>
<p>Carya × ludoviciana, commonly known as the mockernut hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carya cordiformis (butternut) and Carya ovata (shagbark hickory).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its thick, ridged bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces oval, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiky husks. Its wood is heavy, strong, and durable, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
