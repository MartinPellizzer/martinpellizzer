<p>Canthium ficiforme, commonly known as the spider plant or devil's backbone, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Canthium ficiforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
