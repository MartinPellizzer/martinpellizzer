                    <h1>Cuscuta miniacea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta miniacea, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of a host plant and then developing specialized structures to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Cuscuta miniacea is an example of a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on its host for sustenance.</p>
