                    <h1>Chrysopsis acaulis</h1>
<p>Chrysopsis acaulis, commonly known as the cushion chrysanthemum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high elevations of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by tightly packed disc florets, giving it a compact, cushion-like appearance. The plant has short, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and vibrant color make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
