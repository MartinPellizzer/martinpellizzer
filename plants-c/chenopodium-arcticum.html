                    <h1>Chenopodium arcticum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium arcticum, commonly known as Arctic goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent leaves, which help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium arcticum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
