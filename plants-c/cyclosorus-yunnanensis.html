<p>Cyclosorus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cyclosorus, is a rare and endangered fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a unique circular pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this botanical species.</p>
