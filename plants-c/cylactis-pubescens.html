                    <h1>Cylactis pubescens</h1>
<p>Cylactis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
