                    <h1>Cuscuta howelliana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta howelliana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, thread-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
