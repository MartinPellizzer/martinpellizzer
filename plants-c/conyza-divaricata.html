<p>Conyza divaricata, commonly known as the slenderleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellow to white composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Conyza divaricata is often found in regions with warm climates and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas.</p>
