                    <h1>Chorizanthe obovata f. prostrata</h1>
<p>Chorizanthe obovata f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate choris, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
