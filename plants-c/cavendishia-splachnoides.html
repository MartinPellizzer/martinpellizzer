                    <h1>Cavendishia splachnoides</h1>
<p>Cavendishia splachnoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
