<p>Cogswellia gormanii, commonly known as the Gorman's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a dense, spiny covering that helps protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
