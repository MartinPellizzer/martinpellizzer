                    <h1>Cerasus erythrocarpa f. mogoltavica</h1>
<p>Cerasus erythrocarpa f. mogoltavica, commonly known as the Mogoltavica cherry, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a flowering shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant in cultivated landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts.</p>
