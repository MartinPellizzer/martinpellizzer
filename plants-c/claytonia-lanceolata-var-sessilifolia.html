                    <h1>Claytonia lanceolata var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Claytonia lanceolata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf springbeauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of elliptic to ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack distinct petioles. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
