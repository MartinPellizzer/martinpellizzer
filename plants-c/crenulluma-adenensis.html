<p>Crenulluma adenensis, commonly known as the Adenese crenulate, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, wavy-edged leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crenulluma adenensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
