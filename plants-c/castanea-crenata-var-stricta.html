                    <h1>Castanea crenata var. stricta</h1>
<p>Castanea crenata var. stricta, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut or Japanese horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. The nuts are edible when mature, though they require proper preparation to remove bitterness.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of chestnuts for culinary use.</p>
