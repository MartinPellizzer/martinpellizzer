                    <h1>Chlamydostylus</h1>
<p>Chlamydostylus, commonly known as the "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps them conserve moisture in arid environments. They typically have small, clustered leaves and produce small, white or yellow flowers. Chlamydostylus species are often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh conditions, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats.</p>
