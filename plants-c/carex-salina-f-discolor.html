                    <h1>Carex salina f. discolor</h1>
<p>Carex salina f. discolor, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a variant of the salt marsh sedge native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its foliage is typically bluish-gray, which helps it tolerate high salt concentrations.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges.</p>
