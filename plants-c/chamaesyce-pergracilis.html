<p>Chamaesyce pergracilis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with thin, hairless stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce pergracilis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
