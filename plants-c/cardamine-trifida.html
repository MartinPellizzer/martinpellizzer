<p>Cardamine trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in a loose cluster atop the stems. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Cardamine trifida thrives in wet soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
