                    <h1>Corethrogyne racemosa</h1>
<p>Corethrogyne racemosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low, spreading growth habit, often forming mats of succulent leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Corethrogyne racemosa is adapted to survive in drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
