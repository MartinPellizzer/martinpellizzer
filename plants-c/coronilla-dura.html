                    <h1>Coronilla dura</h1>
<p>Coronilla dura, commonly known as hard crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>Coronilla dura is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
