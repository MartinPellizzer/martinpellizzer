<p>Convolvulus pennatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
