<p>Ctenopteris mayoris, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, segmented stems that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris mayoris thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
