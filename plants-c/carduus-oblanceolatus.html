<p>Carduus oblanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact, spherical head, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces and sharp margins, contributing to its defensive characteristics.</p>
<p>Carduus oblanceolatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
