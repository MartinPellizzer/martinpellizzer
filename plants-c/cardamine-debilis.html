                    <h1>Cardamine debilis</h1>
<p>Cardamine debilis, commonly known as slender water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and can be sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator of water quality.</p>
