                    <h1>Casuarina grandis</h1>
<p>Casuarina grandis, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in catkins, giving it a pine-like appearance. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its small, woody fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along shorelines.</p>
<p>Casuarina grandis is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to grow in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
