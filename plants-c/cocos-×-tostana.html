                    <h1>Cocos × tostana</h1>
<p>Cocos × tostana, commonly known as the hybrid coconut palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Cocos nucifera* (the tall coconut palm) and *Cocos humilis* (the dwarf coconut palm).</p>
<p>It exhibits a mix of characteristics from both parent species, including a shorter stature and a more compact growth habit. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of *Cocos nucifera*, with a higher oil content in the flesh. Its leaves are broader and more robust, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its resilience to environmental stress and its potential for agricultural use in tropical regions.</p>
