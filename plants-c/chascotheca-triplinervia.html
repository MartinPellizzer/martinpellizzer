<p>Chascotheca triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately divided with three main veins, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
