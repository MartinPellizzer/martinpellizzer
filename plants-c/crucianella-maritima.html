                    <h1>Crucianella maritima</h1>
<p>Crucianella maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or rocky coastal soils.</p>
<p>Crucianella maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
