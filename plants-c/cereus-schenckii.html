<p>Cereus schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cereus schenckii thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
