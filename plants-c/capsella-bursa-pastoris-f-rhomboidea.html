<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris f. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid weed, is a variant of the common chickweed.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate or ascending stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically rhombic or ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive triangular seed pods.</p>
<p>This form is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
