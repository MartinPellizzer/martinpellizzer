                    <h1>Carpinus betulus var. quercifolia</h1>
<p>Carpinus betulus var. quercifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, nearly smooth bark that darkens with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in hedgerows and urban landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive form.</p>
<p>The variety quercifolia is distinguished by its broader, more oak-like leaves compared to the typical hornbeam.</p>
