<p>Carum porphyrocoleon, commonly known as the purple-leaved caraway, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-hued leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in shaded woodlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, similar to other members of the caraway genus.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is not widely cultivated or studied.</p>
