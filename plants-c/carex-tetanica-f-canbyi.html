<p>Carex tetanica f. canbyi, commonly known as Canby's tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other sedges.</p>
