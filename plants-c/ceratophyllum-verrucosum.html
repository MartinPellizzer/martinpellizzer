<p>Ceratophyllum verrucosum, commonly known as the spiked hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, spiky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It does not require soil to grow, as it can anchor itself using its rhizoids.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum verrucosum is known for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and improve water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
