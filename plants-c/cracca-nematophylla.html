<p>Cracca nematophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, making it a striking yet elusive species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical wonder.</p>
