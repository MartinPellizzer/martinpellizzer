<p>Cranichis carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
