                    <h1>Colpodium fulvum f. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Colpodium fulvum f. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender yellow tansy, is a rare and diminutive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral structures and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Colpodium fulvum. The plant features small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in dense clusters, with narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
