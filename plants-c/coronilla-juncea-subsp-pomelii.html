<p>Coronilla juncea subsp.</p>
<p>pomelii, commonly known as the Mediterranean vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
