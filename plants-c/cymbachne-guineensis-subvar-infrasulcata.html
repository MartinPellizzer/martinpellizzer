<p>Cymbachne guineensis subvar. infrasulcata, commonly known as the African grass or Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used for forage or in erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
