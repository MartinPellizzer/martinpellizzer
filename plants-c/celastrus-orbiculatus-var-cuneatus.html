                    <h1>Celastrus orbiculatus var. cuneatus</h1>
<p>Celastrus orbiculatus var. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually narrower than those of the typical C. orbiculatus. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
