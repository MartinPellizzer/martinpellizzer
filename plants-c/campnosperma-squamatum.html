<p>Campnosperma squamatum, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small, deciduous tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are arranged in clusters and attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native range and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas.</p>
