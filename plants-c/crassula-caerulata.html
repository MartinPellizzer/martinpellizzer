                    <h1>Crassula caerulata</h1>
<p>Crassula caerulata, commonly known as the blue crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
