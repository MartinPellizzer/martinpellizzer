<p>Croton hovarum var. subglaber, commonly known as the smoothleaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and lack the typical hairiness seen in other croton species. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
