<p>Chaetogastra repens, commonly known as the creeping chaetogastra, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist or semi-shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
