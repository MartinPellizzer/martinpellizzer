                    <h1>Celtis glabrata</h1>
<p>Celtis glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, green berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not considered palatable to humans.</p>
<p>Celtis glabrata is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
