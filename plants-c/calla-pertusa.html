                    <h1>Calla pertusa</h1>
<p>Calla pertusa, commonly known as the creeping calla, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces striking white or cream-colored spathe that resembles a calla lily, though it is not closely related to the true calla lilies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Calla pertusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>
