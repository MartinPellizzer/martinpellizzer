<p>Cyrtopera caricifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Cyrtopera caricifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
