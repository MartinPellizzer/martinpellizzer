<p>Centaurea kartschiana f. troglodytes, commonly known as the troglodytes form of Kartschian's centaury, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spiny flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which help in attracting specific pollinators. It is often found in limestone formations and crevices, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this form is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
