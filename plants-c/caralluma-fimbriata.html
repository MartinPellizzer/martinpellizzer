                    <h1>Caralluma fimbriata</h1>
<p>Caralluma fimbriata, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, India, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caralluma fimbriata is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it highly adapted to survive in drought conditions.</p>
