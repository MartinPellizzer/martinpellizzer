                    <h1>Cactus obvallatus</h1>
<p>Cactus obvallatus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for better light penetration.</p>
<p>Cactus obvallatus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping.</p>
