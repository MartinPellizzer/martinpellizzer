                    <h1>Carex kolymaensis</h1>
<p>Carex kolymaensis, commonly known as Kolyma sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant produces dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Carex kolymaensis plays an important ecological role in Arctic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals.</p>
