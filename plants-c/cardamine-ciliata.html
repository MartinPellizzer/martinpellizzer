                    <h1>Cardamine ciliata</h1>
<p>Cardamine ciliata, commonly known as the hairy water-cress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist and shady environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a valued plant in some culinary traditions.</p>
