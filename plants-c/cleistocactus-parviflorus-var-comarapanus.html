<p>Cleistocactus parviflorus var. comarapanus, commonly known as the Comarapa cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
