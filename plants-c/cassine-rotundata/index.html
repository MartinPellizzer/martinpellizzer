                            <h1>Cassine Rotundata</h1>
<p>Roundleaf cassine, scientifically known as Cassine rotundata, is a unique and resilient plant native to the wetlands and riparian zones of Southeast Asia. This small, shrub-like species is characterized by its round, waxy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Despite its modest size, it plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Its ability to thrive in moist environments makes it an important indicator species for wetland health. With its distinctive appearance and ecological significance, Cassine rotundata remains a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
