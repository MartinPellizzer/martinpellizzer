                    <h1>Conocarpus hirtus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus hirtus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of the Americas, particularly from the southern United States to northern Argentina. This plant is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves, which help it thrive in saline environments. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>The white mangrove plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
