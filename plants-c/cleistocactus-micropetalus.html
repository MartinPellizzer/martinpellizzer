                    <h1>Cleistocactus micropetalus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petalled closed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of short, spiny ribs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait typical of many nocturnal flowering cacti. Its stems are typically green and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus micropetalus is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
