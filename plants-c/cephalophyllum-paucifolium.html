                    <h1>Cephalophyllum paucifolium</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum paucifolium, commonly known as the few-leaved headplant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, erect stems above the foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum paucifolium is prized by collectors for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
