                    <h1>Crepidium neoebudicum</h1>
<p>Crepidium neoebudicum, commonly known as the Neobud's slipper orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for pollinators, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often on rock faces or in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
