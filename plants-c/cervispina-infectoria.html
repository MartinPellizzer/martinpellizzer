                    <h1>Cervispina infectoria</h1>
<p>Cervispina infectoria, commonly known as the Crimson Thornvine, is a strikingly ornamental yet potentially hazardous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, reddish-brown spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by bright orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, handling or ingestion of any part of the plant should be avoided.</p>
