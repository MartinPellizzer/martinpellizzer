                    <h1>Carex salina f. pallida</h1>
<p>Carex salina f. pallida, commonly known as the pale salt marsh sedge, is a variant of the salt marsh sedge native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green, distinguishing it from the more common green form. This plant thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The pale coloration of its foliage is an adaptation to reduce water loss in its harsh, coastal habitat.</p>
