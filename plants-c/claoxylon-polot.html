                    <h1>Claoxylon polot</h1>
<p>Claoxylon polot, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
