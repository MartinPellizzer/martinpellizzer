                    <h1>Carya porcina var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Carya porcina var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute chestnut, is a variant of the common chestnut native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves and bark, which distinguish it from other chestnut species. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other members of the genus Carya. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hardwood forests.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role and historical use by indigenous peoples.</p>
