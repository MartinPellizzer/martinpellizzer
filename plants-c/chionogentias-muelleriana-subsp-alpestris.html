<p>Chionogentias muelleriana subsp.</p>
<p>alpestris, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
