The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and fibrous, which help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat.</p>
