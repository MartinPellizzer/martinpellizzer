                <h1>Capnophyllum leiocarpon</h1>
<p>Capnophyllum leiocarpon, commonly known as the smooth-leaved capnophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late summer. Its growth is highly dependent on cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
