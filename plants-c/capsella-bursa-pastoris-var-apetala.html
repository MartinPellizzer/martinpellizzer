<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. apetala, commonly known as the common chickweed variant with reduced flowers, is a variant of the common weed chickweed.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of typical floral structures, making it distinct from the standard variety. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along pathways. Its morphology includes small, heart-shaped leaves and a short, hairy stem.</p>
<p>While it lacks the showy flowers of the typical species, it still exhibits the same rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
