<p>Cuscuta epithymum subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as white dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white, spherical flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts.</p>
<p>The plant is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants.</p>
