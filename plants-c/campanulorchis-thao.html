                    <h1>Campanulorchis thao</h1>
<p>Campanulorchis thao, commonly known as the Thao bell orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Campanulorchis thao is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
