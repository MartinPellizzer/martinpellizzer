                    <h1>Cyclosorus excrescens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus excrescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are adventitious, allowing it to anchor itself in soft substrates.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus excrescens is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
