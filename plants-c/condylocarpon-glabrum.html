                    <h1>Condylocarpon glabrum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwrack, is a marine algae belonging to the family Fucaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery thallus that grows in dense mats on rocky substrates in intertidal zones. The plant has a simple, unbranched structure with a central axis and small, bladder-like air bladders that aid in buoyancy. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water for dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
