                    <h1>Centaurea aspera f. parcespinulosa</h1>
<p>Centaurea aspera f. parcespinulosa, commonly known as the sparse-spinulose bluemink, is a botanical variant of the common centaury.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced and sparse arrangement of spinulose (bristly) structures on its flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This form is noted for its distinct morphology, which sets it apart from the typical form of Centaurea aspera.</p>
