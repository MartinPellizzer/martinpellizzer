<p>Cupressus lindleyi subsp.</p>
<p>hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to a small region in Central America. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
