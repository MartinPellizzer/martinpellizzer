                    <h1>Cycas gracilis var. glauca</h1>
<p>Cycas gracilis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue cycas, is a cycad species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feather-like, glossy green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
