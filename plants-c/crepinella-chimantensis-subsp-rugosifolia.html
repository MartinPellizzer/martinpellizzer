<p>Crepinella chimantensis subsp.</p>
<p>rugosifolia, commonly known as the rugged leaf crepinella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and often crinkled foliage, which gives it its subspecific name "rugosifolia.".</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, while its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
