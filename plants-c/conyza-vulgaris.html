                    <h1>Conyza vulgaris</h1>

<p>It features slender, branched stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It has serrated leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures.</p>
