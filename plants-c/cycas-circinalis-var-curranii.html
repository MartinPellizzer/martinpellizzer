<p>Cycas circinalis var. curranii, commonly known as the Curran's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to the Philippines and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
