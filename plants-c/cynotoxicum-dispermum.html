<p>Cynotoxicum dispermum, commonly known as the two-seeded death cap, is a toxic species of the Amanita genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a white cap that turns yellow with age, a stem that is often covered in a fibrous sheath, and a distinctive ring around the stem. The fruiting bodies typically grow in woodlands and forests, often associated with decaying organic matter. Its spores are produced in a volva, a cup-like structure at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion and handle with caution.</p>
