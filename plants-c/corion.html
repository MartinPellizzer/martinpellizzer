                    <h1>Corion</h1>
<p>Corion, commonly known as the seed coat, is a protective outer layer that surrounds the embryo of a seed.</p>
<p>It is composed primarily of tough, fibrous materials such as lignin and cellulose, which provide structural support and defense against mechanical damage. The corion also plays a crucial role in regulating water uptake and gas exchange during seed germination. In some species, it may contain pigments or compounds that contribute to the seed's color or chemical properties.</p>
<p>Its composition and thickness can vary significantly among different plant families.</p>
