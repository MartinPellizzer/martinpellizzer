                    <h1>Cactus pallescens</h1>
<p>Cactus pallescens, commonly known as the whitish cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to whitish stems, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. These hairs help reduce water loss by reflecting sunlight and minimizing transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
