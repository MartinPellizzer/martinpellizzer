<p>Coffea mogenetii, commonly known as the Mogenetii coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce its unique coffee beans. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the flowers are white and fragrant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation and genetic diversity, Coffea mogenetii is considered a valuable species for coffee research and conservation efforts.</p>
