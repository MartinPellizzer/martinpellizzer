<p>Crepidiastrum × muratagenii, commonly known as the hybrid ivy, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Crepidiastrum humile and Crepidiastrum muratagense, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its rapid growth and ability to cover surfaces, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
