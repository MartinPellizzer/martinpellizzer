                    <h1>Crepidomanes pallidum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes pallidum, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes pallidum is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in sandy washes.</p>
