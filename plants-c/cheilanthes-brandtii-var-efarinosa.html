                    <h1>Cheilanthes brandtii var. efarinosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes brandtii var. efarinosa, commonly known as the Brandt's rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the margins. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a dense covering of fine, silky hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Cheilanthes genus, which are known for their ability to thrive in rocky, limestone soils.</p>
