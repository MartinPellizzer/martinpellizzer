                    <h1>Cuscuta papillosa var. tunetana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta papillosa var. tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. This species is native to North Africa and is often found parasitizing various shrubs and herbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and serving as a food source for certain insects.</p>
