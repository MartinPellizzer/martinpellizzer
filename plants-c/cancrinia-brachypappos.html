<p>Cancrinia brachypappos, commonly known as the narrow-pappus sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, erect stems bear clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The narrow pappus hairs on its seeds aid in wind dispersal, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
