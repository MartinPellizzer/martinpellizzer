                    <h1>Cyclea kinabaluensis var. kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Cyclea kinabaluensis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo cycloids, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found growing in rocky crevices or on forest floors, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
