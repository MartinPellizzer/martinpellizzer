                    <h1>Calopogonium mucunoides</h1>
<p>Calopogonium mucunoides, commonly known as the hairy urd or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by pod fruits containing several elliptical seeds. It is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture.</p>
