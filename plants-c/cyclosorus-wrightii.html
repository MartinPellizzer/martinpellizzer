<p>Cyclosorus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged substrates. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
