<p>Cissus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or limestone formations. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Cissus calcicola is also noted for its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months.</p>
