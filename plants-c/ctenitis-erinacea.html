                    <h1>Ctenitis erinacea</h1>
<p>Ctenitis erinacea, commonly known as the hairy ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis erinacea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
