                    <h1>Cuscuta alataloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta alataloba, commonly known as the tropical dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings.</p>
