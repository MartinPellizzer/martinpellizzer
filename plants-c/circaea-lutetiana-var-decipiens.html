<p>Circaea lutetiana var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its deceptive appearance, as it resembles other white-flowered plants in its habitat.</p>
