                    <h1>Caralluma deflersiana</h1>
<p>Caralluma deflersiana, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma deflersiana is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
