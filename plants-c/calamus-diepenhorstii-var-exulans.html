<p>Calamus diepenhorstii var. exulans, commonly known as the Diepenhorst's arrowroot, is a rare and distinctive member of the Aroid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of many arum species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study.</p>
