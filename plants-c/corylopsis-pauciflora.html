<p>Corylopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the Chinese winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, providing early-season nectar for pollinators. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Its red berries, which persist into winter, are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Corylopsis pauciflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
