                            <h1>Carduus Glaucinus</h1>
<p>Glaucous thistle, scientifically known as Carduus glaucinus, is a striking plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. This species thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its waxy, bluish-gray coating helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Despite its appearance, the Glaucous thistle plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
