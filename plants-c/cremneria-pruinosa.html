                <h1>Cremneria pruinosa</h1>
<p>Cremneria pruinosa, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost waxy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white or pale pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cremneria pruinosa is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
