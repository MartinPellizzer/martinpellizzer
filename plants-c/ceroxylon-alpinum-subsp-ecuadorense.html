<p>Ceroxylon alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mountain heather, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native range.</p>
