                    <h1>Carex maritima var. misera</h1>
<p>Carex maritima var. misera, commonly known as the sea sedge, is a variant of the sea sedge species native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. This plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate salt and waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
