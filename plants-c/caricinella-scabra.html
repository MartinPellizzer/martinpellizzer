                    <h1>Caricinella scabra</h1>
<p>Caricinella scabra, commonly known as the rough-hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in southern Africa, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water. The plant is characterized by its short, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stems for anchorage.</p>
<p>Caricinella scabra is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is an indicator species of nutrient-rich waters.</p>
