                    <h1>Calypso borealis</h1>
<p>Calypso borealis, commonly known as the northern calypso, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive violet or purple tinge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calypso borealis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
