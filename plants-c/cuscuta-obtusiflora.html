                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants, including crops like beans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
