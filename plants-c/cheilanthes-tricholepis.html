<p>Cheilanthes tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy lady fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
