                    <h1>Chloris</h1>
<p>Chloris, commonly known as windgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of approximately 40 species, predominantly found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. These plants typically have slender, tufted growth habits with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, often with two stamens.</p>
<p>Chloris species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed environments.</p>
