<p>Chrozophora mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous roots and sprawling growth habit make it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Velvetleaf is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in ecological succession.</p>
