<p>Centaurea amadanensis subsp.</p>
<p>gymnoclada, commonly known as the Amad√°n Gymnoclad Centaurea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
