                    <h1>Cometia lucida</h1>
<p>Cometia lucida, commonly known as the radiant comet plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-like flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique trait among its genus. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to maximize its phototropic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
