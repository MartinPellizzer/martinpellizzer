                    <h1>Cactus krameri</h1>
<p>Cactus krameri, commonly known as the silver cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with a distinctive appearance featuring spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are often pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
