                    <h1>Castilleja pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Castilleja pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of other plants for nutrients. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja pyramidalis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
