                            <h1>Cacalia Asteriflora</h1>
<p>Cacalia starflower, scientifically known as Cacalia asteriflora, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the mountainous regions of South America. This perennial herb is renowned for its delicate, star-shaped blooms that resemble tiny daisies, often appearing in vibrant shades of white and pale yellow. Thriving in cool, moist environments, it is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it adds a touch of elegance to the landscape. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its beauty, the plant remains relatively obscure, highlighting the need for greater awareness and conservation efforts.</p>
