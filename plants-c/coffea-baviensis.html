<p>Coffea baviensis, commonly known as the Baviensis coffee plant, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that produces red, fleshy berries containing its seeds, which are used to make coffee. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes and well-drained soil. It has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated coffee species.</p>
