                    <h1>Cystopteris alpina</h1>
<p>Cystopteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along streams in alpine zones. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>Cystopteris alpina is notable for its ability to tolerate cold climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
