<p>Chamaeanthus laciniatus, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
