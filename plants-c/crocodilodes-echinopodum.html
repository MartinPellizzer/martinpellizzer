                    <h1>Crocodilodes echinopodum</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes echinopodum, commonly known as the spiny bladderpod, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the warmer months. Its fruit is a dry pod that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
