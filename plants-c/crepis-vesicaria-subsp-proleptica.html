<p>Crepis vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>proleptica, commonly known as the early mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
