<p>Crassula giessii, commonly known as the Giesse's crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water for survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
