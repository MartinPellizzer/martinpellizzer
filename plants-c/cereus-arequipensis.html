<p>Cereus arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes Mountains of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
