                    <h1>Campylocentrum ariza-juliae</h1>
<p>Campylocentrum ariza-juliae, commonly known as the Julia's star cactus, is a rare and striking epiphytic cactus native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a unique structure with areoles covered in dense white hairs, which help protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
