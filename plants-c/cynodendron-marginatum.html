                    <h1>Cynodendron marginatum</h1>
<p>Cynodendron marginatum, commonly known as the marginate cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with a pale yellow or white margin, giving it its common name. This plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
