                    <h1>Cuscuta glabrior f. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta glabrior f. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants in various regions.</p>
<p>Its f. pedicellata form is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from other forms of Cuscuta glabrior.</p>
