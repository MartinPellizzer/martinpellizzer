                    <h1>Castanea × morrisii</h1>
<p>Castanea × morrisii, commonly known as the Morris chestnut.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollisima). This plant is characterized by its robust growth and resistance to chestnut blight, making it a valuable candidate for reforestation efforts. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a serrated edge, and the plant produces spiny husks enclosing sweet, edible nuts.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential as a food source.</p>
