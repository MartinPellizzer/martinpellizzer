<p>Chevaliera veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's chevaliera, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
