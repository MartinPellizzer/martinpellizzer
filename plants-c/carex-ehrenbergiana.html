The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Carex ehrenbergiana is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
