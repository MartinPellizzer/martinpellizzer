<p>Cryptandra minutifolia subsp.</p>
<p>brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It features small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
