                    <h1>Cyperorchis × florinda</h1>
<p>Cyperorchis × florinda, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a fascinating plant that combines traits from its parent species, Cyperus and Orchis.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, orchid-like flowers with delicate, often purple or pink hues. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This hybrid is notable for its adaptability and ornamental value in wetland gardens.</p>
