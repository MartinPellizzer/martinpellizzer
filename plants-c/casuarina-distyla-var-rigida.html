                    <h1>Casuarina distyla var. rigida</h1>
<p>Casuarina distyla var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid casuarina, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical, spike-like foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its woody, fire-resistant structure makes it well adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>The rigid casuarina is often used in reforestation and coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature.</p>
