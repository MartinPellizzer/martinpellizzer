                    <h1>Cypholophus melanocarpoides</h1>
<p>Cypholophus melanocarpoides, commonly known as the black-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces dark, fleshy berries that are toxic to most animals. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to a limited extent. It is native to parts of southern Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in the study of parasitic plant interactions.</p>
