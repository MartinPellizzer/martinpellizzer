                    <h1>Croton serratifolius f. tomentosus</h1>
<p>Croton serratifolius f. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a tropical shrub characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a rough texture due to the presence of the tomentose pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within cup-like structures called cyathia, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
