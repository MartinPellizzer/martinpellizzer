<p>Chodanthus splendens var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered splendor cactus, is a succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with short, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
