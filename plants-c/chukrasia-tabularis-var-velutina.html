<p>Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a variant of the chukrasia tabularis, a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects.</p>
