<p>Cyperus monandrus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or brown.
