                <h1>Cuscuta potosina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta potosina, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta potosina is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to reduce crop yields and compete with native flora.</p>
