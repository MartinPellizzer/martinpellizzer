<p>Comarum salesovii, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, leaf-like structures, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and appear in clusters, often emerging from the water surface.</p>
<p>Comarum salesovii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
