<p>Casuarina lugubris, commonly known as the black she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and its distinctive, cylindrical seed pods. The plant has a strong, deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Its leaves are modified into small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>Casuarina lugubris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
