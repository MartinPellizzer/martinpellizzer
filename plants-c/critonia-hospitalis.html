                    <h1>Critonia hospitalis</h1>
<p>Critonia hospitalis, commonly known as the Hospital Plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged form. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used in local healing practices.</p>
