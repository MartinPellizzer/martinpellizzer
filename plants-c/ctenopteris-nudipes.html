                    <h1>Ctenopteris nudipes</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris nudipes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along cliffs or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
