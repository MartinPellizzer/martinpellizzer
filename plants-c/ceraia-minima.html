                    <h1>Ceraia minima</h1>
<p>Ceraia minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Ceraia minima plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
