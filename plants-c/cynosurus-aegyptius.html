                    <h1>Cynosurus aegyptius</h1>
<p>Cynosurus aegyptius, commonly known as Egyptian couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can dominate certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cynosurus aegyptius is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability.</p>
