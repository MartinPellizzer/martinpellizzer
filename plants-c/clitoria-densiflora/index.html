                            <h1>Clitoria Densiflora</h1>
<p>Clitoria densiflora is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, pea-like flowers that range from purple to blue. Native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific, it thrives in warm, humid climates with ample sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual impact. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and water conditions to flourish.</p>
