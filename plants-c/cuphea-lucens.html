                    <h1>Cuphea lucens</h1>
<p>Cuphea lucens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cuphea lucens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
