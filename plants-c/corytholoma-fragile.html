                    <h1>Corytholoma fragile</h1>
<p>Corytholoma fragile, commonly known as the brittle coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, which means it relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, pale yellow or white flowers are clustered in a spike and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant's delicate, thin stems and leaves contribute to its common name, reflecting its fragile appearance.</p>
<p>Corytholoma fragile thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands.</p>
