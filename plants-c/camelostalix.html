<p>Camelostalix, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Camelostalix thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
