<p>Cuscuta platyloba, commonly known as the broadleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often covering its host within days. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, sticky pads that help it attach to the host plant. It is commonly found in agricultural areas and can infest a variety of crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants.</p>
