<p>Carduus nutans subsp.</p>
<p>granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive, pale purple to reddish flower head.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished from the typical Carduus nutans by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral morphology.</p>
