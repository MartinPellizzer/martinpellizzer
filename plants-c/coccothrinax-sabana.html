<p>Coccothrinax sabana, commonly known as the sabana palm, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, slender palm that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant has pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The sabana palm is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes.</p>
