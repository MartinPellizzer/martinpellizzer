                    <h1>Cyperus macrocarpus var. excelsior</h1>
<p>Cyperus macrocarpus var. excelsior, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to dark brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
