                    <h1>Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. stenolepis</h1>
<p>Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. stenolepis, commonly known as sticky goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, woody stems covered in a sticky resin, which is a distinguishing botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and sagebrush steppe habitats.</p>
