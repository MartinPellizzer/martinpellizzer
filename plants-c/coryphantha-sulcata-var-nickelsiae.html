                    <h1>Coryphantha sulcata var. nickelsiae</h1>
<p>Coryphantha sulcata var. nickelsiae, commonly known as the Nickels' barrel cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, ribbed structures and produces small, white to yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
