                    <h1>Chaenostoma stenopetalum</h1>
<p>Chaenostoma stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters near the water's surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Chaenostoma stenopetalum is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
