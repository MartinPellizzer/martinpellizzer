                    <h1>Combesia muscosa var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Combesia muscosa var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark green, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its obtuse leaf tips, which set it apart from other variants of Combisia muscosa.</p>
