<p>Clematis alpina, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Clematis alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats for its beauty and ecological benefits.</p>
