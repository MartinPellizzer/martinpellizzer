<p>Crepis radicata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Crepis radicata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of wet meadows.</p>
