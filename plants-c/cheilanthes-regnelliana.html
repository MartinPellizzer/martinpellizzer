<p>Cheilanthes regnelliana, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to arid and rocky habitats in regions such as the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
