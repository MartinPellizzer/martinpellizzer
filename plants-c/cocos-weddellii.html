                    <h1>Cocos weddellii</h1>
<p>Cocos weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's coconut, is a rare and unique species of palm native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and a tall, slender trunk that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into coconuts, though these are not typically consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
<p>Botanists study Cocos weddellii to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs in its native ecosystem.</p>
