                    <h1>Caulinia</h1>
<p>Caulinia, commonly known as the "Cauliflower of the desert," is a unique member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant features a compact, rosette-like growth pattern with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and clustered, resembling cauliflower, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Caulinia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
