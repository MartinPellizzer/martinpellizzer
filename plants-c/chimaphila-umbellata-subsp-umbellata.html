<p>Chimaphila umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>umbellata, commonly known as the white root or partridgeberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
