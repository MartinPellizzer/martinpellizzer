<p>Commelina obliqua var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky commelina, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, blue-violet flowers. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the sticky, viscid substance that coats its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This botanical feature may play a role in deterring herbivores and aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
