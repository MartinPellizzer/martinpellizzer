<p>Conopodium, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive bladder-like structures on the stems, which are actually specialized leaves called phyllodes. Conopodium species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to their habitat.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
