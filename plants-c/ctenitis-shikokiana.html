<p>Ctenitis shikokiana, commonly known as the Shikoku holly fern, is a species of fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis shikokiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
