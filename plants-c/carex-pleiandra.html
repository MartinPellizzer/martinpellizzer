<p>Carex pleiandra, commonly known as the common marsh sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex pleiandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
