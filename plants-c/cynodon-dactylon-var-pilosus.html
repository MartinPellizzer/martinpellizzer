                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. pilosus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form pilosus. It is widely used for turfgrass due to its durability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays an important role in soil stabilization and erosion control in arid environments.</p>
