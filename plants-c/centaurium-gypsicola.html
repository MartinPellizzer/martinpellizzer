                    <h1>Centaurium gypsicola</h1>
<p>Centaurium gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, such as gypsum soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Centaurium gypsicola is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
