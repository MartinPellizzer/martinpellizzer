<p>Cistanche brunneri, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks true leaves and roots.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like structures that allow it to attach to host plants. It derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Cistanche brunneri is often found growing on species of Ephedra and other shrubs in its native habitat.</p>
