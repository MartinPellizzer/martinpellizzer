                    <h1>Cactus hystrix</h1>
<p>Cactus hystrix, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, enabling it to quickly absorb rainwater.</p>
<p>The cactus also plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
