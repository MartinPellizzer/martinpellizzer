                    <h1>Crataegus × langei</h1>
<p>Crataegus × langei, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with variable morphology. The species is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart.</p>
<p>Crataegus × langei is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
