<p>Coccoloba goldmanii, commonly known as the golden coccoloba, is a species of shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles.</p>

The plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops, adapting to saline and well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces berries that range in color from red to black.</p>
