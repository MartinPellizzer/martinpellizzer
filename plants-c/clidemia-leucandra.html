<p>Clidemia leucandra, commonly known as white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Clidemia leucandra plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting local wildlife.</p>
