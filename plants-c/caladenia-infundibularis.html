                    <h1>Caladenia infundibularis</h1>
<p>Caladenia infundibularis, commonly known as the red-tongued spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive red lip that resembles a spider's tongue. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, due to their mimicry of female wasps.</p>
<p>This species is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
