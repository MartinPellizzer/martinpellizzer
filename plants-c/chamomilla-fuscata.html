<p>Chamomilla fuscata, commonly known as the rough chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in the summer, producing small, composite flower heads that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>While not as widely used in herbal medicine as other chamomile species, it has some traditional uses in folk remedies.</p>
