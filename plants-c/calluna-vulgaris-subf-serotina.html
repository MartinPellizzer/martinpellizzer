<p>Calluna vulgaris subf.</p>
<p>serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heather, is a subspecies of the common heather native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom later in the growing season, usually from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
