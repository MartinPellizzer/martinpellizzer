                    <h1>Candollea</h1>
<p>Candollea, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown, hence its common name. Candollea species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats.</p>
