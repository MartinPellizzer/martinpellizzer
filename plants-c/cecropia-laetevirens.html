<p>Cecropia laetevirens, commonly known as the green-veined ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent veins and its showy, yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful for reforestation and erosion control in degraded areas.</p>
<p>The tree also produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
