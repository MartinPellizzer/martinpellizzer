                    <h1>Cardamine × anomala</h1>
<p>Cardamine × anomala, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Cardamine pratensis (common buttercup) and Cardamine hirsute (hairy bittercress), resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization and genetic diversity in plant species.</p>
