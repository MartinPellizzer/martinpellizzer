                    <h1>Caragana beefensis var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Caragana beefensis var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden pea shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
<p>The variety auriculata is distinguished by its striking, auriculate (ear-shaped) flower buds, which give it its common name.</p>
