                    <h1>Callitriche deflexa f. minor</h1>
<p>Callitriche deflexa f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it forms dense mats on the sediment. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often curved or twisted, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
