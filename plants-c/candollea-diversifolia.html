<p>Candollea diversifolia, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are often variegated with contrasting colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Candollea diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
