                            <h1>Cojoba Catenata</h1>
<p>Cojoba catenata is a rare and fascinating plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in brackish or saltwater environments. This plant is known for its unique ability to tolerate high salinity and frequent tidal exposure. Its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white flowers make it a striking addition to coastal ecosystems. Despite its beauty, Cojoba catenata remains under-studied and is facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
