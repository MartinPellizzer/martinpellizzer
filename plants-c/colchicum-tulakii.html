<p>Colchicum tulakii, commonly known as the Armenian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a bulb-like structure called a corm, which stores nutrients for the plant's survival during dormant periods. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from the base of the corm.</p>
<p>Colchicum tulakii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
