<p>Ctenopteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its fronds are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Ctenopteris glandulosa make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>
