                    <h1>Carex echinata var. hydrophila</h1>
<p>Carex echinata var. hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually brown or greenish in color. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
