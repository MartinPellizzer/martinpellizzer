<p>Cytinus hypocistis subsp.</p>
<p>hypocistis, commonly known as the "buttercup bur" or "crown vetch," is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, swollen base that resembles a cup or a bulb, which is a feature shared with other members of the genus Cytinus.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it often grows in dry, rocky soils.</p>
