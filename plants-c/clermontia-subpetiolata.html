                    <h1>Clermontia subpetiolata</h1>
<p>Clermontia subpetiolata, commonly known as the Mauna Kea fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high elevations of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, biennial habit with a short, thick rhizome. The plant produces a single, upright, leafy shoot that bears a cluster of small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
