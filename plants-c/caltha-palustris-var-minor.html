<p>Caltha palustris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet conditions.</p>
