                            <h1>Cerastium Arvense Subsp. Glandulosum</h1>
<p>Mouse-ear chickweed, scientifically known as Cerastium arvense subsp. glandulosum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant commonly found in disturbed soils and along pathways. It features small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, giving it its common name, and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in spring. This resilient species is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid spread and hardy nature. Despite its reputation, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in certain environments. Its presence highlights the complex relationships between plant life and human-modified landscapes.</p>
