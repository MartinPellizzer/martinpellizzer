<p>Ceropegia arenicola subsp.</p>
<p>pilifera, commonly known as the coastal ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
