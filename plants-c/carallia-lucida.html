                    <h1>Carallia lucida</h1>
<p>Carallia lucida, commonly known as the shining coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it lacks true leaves, instead having scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is often found in rich, organic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
