                    <h1>Citrus × aurantium var. duplex</h1>

<p>It features two sets of flowers on each inflorescence, one set of regular flowers and another set of sterile, showy flowers. This botanical trait is a result of natural or artificial hybridization between different citrus species. The plant typically produces small, round fruits with a thick, aromatic peel.</p>
