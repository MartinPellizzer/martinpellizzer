                    <h1>Cnicus chamaecephalus</h1>
<p>Cnicus chamaecephalus, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
