<p>Capnites alpestris, commonly known as the alpine capnite, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Capnites alpestris is often found in mountain meadows and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
