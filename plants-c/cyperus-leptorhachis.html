<p>Cyperus leptorhachis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense stands that can dominate aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus leptorhachis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
