                    <h1>Cactus glochidiatus</h1>
<p>Cactus glochidiatus, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, barbed spines, which are used for defense against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its adaptations include succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The glochidiates, or small spines, are a defining feature and contribute to its common name.</p>
