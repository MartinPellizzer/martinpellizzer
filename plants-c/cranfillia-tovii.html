                    <h1>Cranfillia tovii</h1>
<p>Cranfillia tovii, commonly known as the Tovii's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to a specific region in Mexico, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
