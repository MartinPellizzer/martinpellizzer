<p>Carex sempervirens f. villarsiana, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a variant of the common sedge that exhibits distinctive silvery-white foliage.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mound-like appearance. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, seed-bearing structures.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is often used in garden settings for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in wet or damp conditions.</p>
