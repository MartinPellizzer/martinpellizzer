                    <h1>Cyperus rheophyticus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rheophyticus, commonly known as the stream sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as stream banks and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Cyperus rheophyticus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
