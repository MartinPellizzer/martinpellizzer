                    <h1>Cheilanthes hirsuta</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize rocky habitats with minimal water requirements.</p>
