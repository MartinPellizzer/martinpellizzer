                    <h1>Cerastium glomeratum var. subviscosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium glomeratum var. subviscosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its sticky leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat.</p>
