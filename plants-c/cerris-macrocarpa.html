                    <h1>Cerris macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cerris macrocarpa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is a valuable species in ecological and ornamental horticulture.</p>
