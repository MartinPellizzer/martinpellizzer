                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. erecta</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. erecta, commonly known as the upright marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has slender, upright stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Caltha palustris.</p>
