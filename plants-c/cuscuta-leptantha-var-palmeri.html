                    <h1>Cuscuta leptantha var. palmeri</h1>
<p>Cuscuta leptantha var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-white flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it commonly parasitizes various shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species.</p>
