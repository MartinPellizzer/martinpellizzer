<p>Calylophus drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in terminal umbels, which are visited by various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the Asclepiadaceae family, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Calylophus drummondiana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils along riverbanks and rocky areas.</p>
