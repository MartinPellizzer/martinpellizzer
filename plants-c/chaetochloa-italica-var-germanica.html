                    <h1>Chaetochloa italica var. germanica</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa italica var. germanica, commonly known as the German hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to moist, calcareous soils in Europe.</p>
<p>It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and water features.</p>
