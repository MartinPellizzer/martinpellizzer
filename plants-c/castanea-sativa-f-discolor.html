                    <h1>Castanea sativa f. discolor</h1>
<p>Castanea sativa f. discolor, commonly known as the variegated sweet chestnut, is a unique variant of the sweet chestnut tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. This form is a natural mutation of the standard Castanea sativa, often occurring in shaded or cooler environments. The plant produces edible nuts similar to its parent species, though the yield may be lower due to its ornamental traits.</p>
<p>It is valued both for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and for its ecological role in supporting wildlife.</p>
