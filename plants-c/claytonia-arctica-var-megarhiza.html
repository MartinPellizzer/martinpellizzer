                    <h1>Claytonia arctica var. megarhiza</h1>
<p>Claytonia arctica var. megarhiza, commonly known as the Arctic spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to other Claytonia species, giving it its specific epithet "megarhiza.".</p>
