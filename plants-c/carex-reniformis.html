                    <h1>Carex reniformis</h1>
<p>Carex reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex reniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
