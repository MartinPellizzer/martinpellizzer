<p>Ceroxylon interruptum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it its common name and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its trunk is typically unbranched and covered in a thick, fibrous layer.</p>
<p>Ceroxylon interruptum is also noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
