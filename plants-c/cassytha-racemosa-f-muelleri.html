                    <h1>Cassytha racemosa f. muelleri</h1>
<p>Cassytha racemosa f. muelleri, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its yellow, thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
