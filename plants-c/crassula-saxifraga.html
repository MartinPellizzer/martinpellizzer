<p>Crassula saxifraga, commonly known as the stonecrop or fairy fan, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions.

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
