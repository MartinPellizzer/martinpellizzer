                    <h1>Cameraria obesa</h1>
<p>Cameraria obesa, commonly known as the fat leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>Its larvae are leaf-mining insects that feed on the leaves of various plants, primarily in the family Myrtaceae. The adult moths are tiny, with wingspans typically less than 5 millimeters, and they are often difficult to spot. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for these insects, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Cameraria obesa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in diverse vegetation.</p>
