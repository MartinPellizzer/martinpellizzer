                    <h1>Cheilanthes profusa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes profusa, commonly known as the rock hound, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, cushion-like clusters, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to survive prolonged droughts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes profusa is often found growing on limestone and sandstone, making it a common sight in desert landscapes.</p>
