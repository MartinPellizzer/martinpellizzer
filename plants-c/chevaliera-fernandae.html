                    <h1>Chevaliera fernandae</h1>
<p>Chevaliera fernandae, commonly known as the Fernand's chevaliera, is a rare fern species native to the island of La RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other chevaliera species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
