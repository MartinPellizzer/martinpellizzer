<p>Cereus × beckmannii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and unique blooming habit make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in suitable climates.</p>
