                <h1>Callitropsis benthamii</h1>
<p>Callitropsis benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' tamarack, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
