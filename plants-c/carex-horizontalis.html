<p>Carex horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, linear leaves that grow in a mat-like formation, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Carex horizontalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
