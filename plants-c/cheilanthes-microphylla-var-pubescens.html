                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often found in desert or coastal scrub habitats. Its fronds are typically dark green and covered with fine pubescence, which provides additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>This varietal form is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
