<p>Caralluma linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It features thin, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Caralluma linearis is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
