<p>Capillipedium subrepens var. glaucophyllum, commonly known as the glaucophyll variant of the creeping capillipedium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a bluish-green hue due to the presence of a waxy cuticle. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often borne on short pedicels.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
