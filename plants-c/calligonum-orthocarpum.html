                    <h1>Calligonum orthocarpum</h1>
<p>Calligonum orthocarpum, commonly known as the narrowleaf goosefoot, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by small, round fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Calligonum orthocarpum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
