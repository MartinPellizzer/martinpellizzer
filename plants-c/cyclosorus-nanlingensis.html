<p>Cyclosorus nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in freshwater environments with low light and nutrient-rich conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
