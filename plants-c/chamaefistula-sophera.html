<p>Chamaefistula sophera, commonly known as the Persian lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features greyish-barked stems and heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces fragrant, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its showy blooms and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that this species is sometimes confused with other similar-looking plants in the Oleaceae family.</p>
