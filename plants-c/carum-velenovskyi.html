                    <h1>Carum velenovskyi</h1>
<p>Carum velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's caraway, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, similar to other caraway species, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carum velenovskyi is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
