<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cooler, humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
