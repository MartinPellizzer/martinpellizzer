<p>Cynodon dactylon subsp.</p>
<p>arcuatus, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like turf.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly through both stolons and rhizomes contributes to its invasive potential in many regions.</p>
