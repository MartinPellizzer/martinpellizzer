                    <h1>Camarotis callosa</h1>
<p>Camarotis callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
