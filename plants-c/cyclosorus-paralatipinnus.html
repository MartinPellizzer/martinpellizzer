<p>Cyclosorus paralatipinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus paralatipinnus is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help clarify water by filtering debris.</p>
