                    <h1>Calamus belumutensis</h1>
<p>Calamus belumutensis, commonly known as the Bornean calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Calamus belumutensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
