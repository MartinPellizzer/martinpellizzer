<p>Ceraia ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ephemeral blooms that appear for only a short period during the dry season. The plant has a unique growth cycle, often surviving in harsh, arid environments by conserving water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its brief flowering period, it plays a significant role in its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
