                    <h1>Centrosema coriaceum</h1>
<p>Centrosema coriaceum, commonly known as the hairy beggar's tick, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hard, hairy capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
