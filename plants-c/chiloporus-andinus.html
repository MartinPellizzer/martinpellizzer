                    <h1>Chiloporus andinus</h1>
<p>Chiloporus andinus, commonly known as the Andean leaf beetle, is a small insect belonging to the family Chiloporidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant it is associated with, likely a species of flowering plant, provides both food and habitat for this beetle. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The beetle's presence indicates the health of the ecosystem, making it an important indicator species in Andean flora studies.</p>
