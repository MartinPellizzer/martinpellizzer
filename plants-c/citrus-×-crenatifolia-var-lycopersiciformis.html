                    <h1>Citrus × crenatifolia var. lycopersiciformis</h1>
<p>Citrus × crenatifolia var. lycopersiciformis, commonly known as the tomato-shaped citrus, is a unique hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both citrus and tomato species.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, fruit-like structure resembling a tomato, with a thick, fleshy rind and a juicy, acidic interior. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. Its fruit is often used in culinary applications due to its tart flavor and unique appearance.</p>
<p>This botanical curiosity is a result of natural or artificial crossbreeding between citrus and Solanum species.</p>
