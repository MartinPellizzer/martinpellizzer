<p>Cyathea arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of dead leaf bases. The plant has a crown of large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea arborescens reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with the spores produced on the undersides of its sporangia.</p>
