                    <h1>Chlorospatha macphersonii</h1>
<p>Chlorospatha macphersonii, commonly known as the MacPherson's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique yellowish-green hue, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
