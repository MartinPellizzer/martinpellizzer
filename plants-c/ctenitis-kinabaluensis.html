                    <h1>Ctenitis kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically above 1,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
