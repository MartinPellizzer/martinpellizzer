<p>Calceolus reginae, commonly known as the imperial pansy, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns resembling the face of a queen. The plant grows in rocky, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is a perennial herb that produces delicate, heart-shaped leaves and blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calceolus reginae is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
