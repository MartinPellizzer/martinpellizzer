                    <h1>Carex paludosa</h1>
<p>Carex paludosa, commonly known as bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters, typical of the Carex genus. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Carex paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
