                    <h1>Craterosiphon quarrei</h1>
<p>Craterosiphon quarrei, commonly known as the rockweed, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its filamentous structure composed of branching, thread-like filaments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in intertidal zones, where it can withstand fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. Its cellular structure includes chloroplasts that enable photosynthesis, and it plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Craterosiphon quarrei is also used in scientific research for studying algal physiology and ecological adaptations.</p>
