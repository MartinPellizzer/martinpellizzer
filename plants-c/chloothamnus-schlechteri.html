                    <h1>Chloothamnus schlechteri</h1>
<p>Chloothamnus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellowish-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
