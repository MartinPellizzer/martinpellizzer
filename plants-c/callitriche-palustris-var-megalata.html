                    <h1>Callitriche palustris var. megalata</h1>
<p>Callitriche palustris var. megalata, commonly known as the large-flowered water starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its small, floating or submerged leaves and tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, facilitated by water currents and insect visitors.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water ecosystems and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
