                    <h1>Cyclosorus subnamburensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus subnamburensis, commonly known as the Nambura fern, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and stream margins, where it can receive adequate light and nutrients. Its unique morphology includes a distinctive arrangement of leaflets that aid in its survival in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
