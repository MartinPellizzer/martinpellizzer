<p>Catalpa pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' catalpa, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
