                    <h1>Cistanche tubulosa</h1>
<p>Cistanche tubulosa, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic desert vine, is a halophytic plant native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic species that attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Fabaceae family. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which is a unique adaptation to its harsh environment. Its stems are fleshy and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and the plant is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
