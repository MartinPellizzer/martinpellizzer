                    <h1>Cyclosorus adenostegius</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus adenostegius, commonly known as the velvet spongeplant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its intricate, sponge-like structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ceratophyllaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with small, translucent leaves that give it a velvety appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, it plays a role in providing microhabitats for aquatic invertebrates and contributes to water filtration.</p>
