<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with small, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Cactus subinermis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
