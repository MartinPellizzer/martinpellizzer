<p>Cardamine barbareifolia, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and often toxic sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, though caution is advised due to the presence of protoanemonin, a compound that can cause irritation.</p>
