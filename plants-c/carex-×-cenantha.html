<p>Carex × cenantha, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex morrowii, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences add texture and interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>While it does not produce seeds, it is often propagated through rhizomes or division for garden use.</p>
