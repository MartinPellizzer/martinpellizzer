<p>Cryptogramma crispa f. americana, commonly known as the American cryptogramma, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant with delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
