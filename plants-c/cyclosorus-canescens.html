<p>Cyclosorus canescens, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of moss that belongs to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and silvery-gray appearance due to its fine, papillate leaves. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, upright stems called setae.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus canescens plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
