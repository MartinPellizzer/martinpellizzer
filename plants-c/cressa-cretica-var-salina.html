<p>[WRONG START] Cressa crectica var. salina, commonly known as salt marsh cress, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and estuaries where soil salinity is high. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tiny white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
