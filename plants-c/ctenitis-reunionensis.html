<p>Ctenitis reunionensis, commonly known as the Reunion fern, is a rare species native to the island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble a fern. The plant has a unique morphology with small, overlapping leaflets that form a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
