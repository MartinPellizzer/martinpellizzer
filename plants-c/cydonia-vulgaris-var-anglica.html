                    <h1>Cydonia vulgaris var. anglica</h1>
<p>Cydonia vulgaris var. anglica, commonly known as the English quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow, inedible fruits that ripen in autumn. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in hedging or as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The fruit, though tough and astringent when unripe, becomes sweet and aromatic when fully mature.</p>
