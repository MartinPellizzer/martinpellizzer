                    <h1>Cuscuta tatei</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tatei, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and shrubs. Cuscuta tatei is native to East Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to weaken host plants make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
