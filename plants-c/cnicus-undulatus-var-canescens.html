                    <h1>Cnicus undulatus var. canescens</h1>
<p>Cnicus undulatus var. canescens, commonly known as the rough sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
