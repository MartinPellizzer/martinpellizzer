<p>Cereus eburneus var. polygonus, commonly known as the white star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a ribbed structure with spines that provide protection against herbivores. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to desert landscapes.</p>
