<p>Corybas matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' hooded orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small terrestrial orchid with a distinctive hood-like labellum that resembles a flower-like structure. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale green flower, which is often covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
