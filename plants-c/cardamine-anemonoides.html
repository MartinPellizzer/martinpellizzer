                    <h1>Cardamine anemonoides</h1>
<p>Cardamine anemonoides, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moisture, it is often found in areas with consistent groundwater or heavy rainfall.</p>
