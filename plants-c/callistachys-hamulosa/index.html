                            <h1>Callistachys Hamulosa</h1>
<p>Callistachys hamulosa is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. This species thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered plant. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
