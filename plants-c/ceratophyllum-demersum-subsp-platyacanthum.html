<p>Ceratophyllum demersum subsp.</p>
<p>platyacanthum, commonly known as the broad-awned watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, whorled leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found near the water surface. It thrives in still to slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
