<p>It is native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are typically green and have a mild, cucumber-like flavor. Its vines are trailing and can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for trellising.</p>
<p>The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blossoms, a characteristic common in many cucurbit species.</p>
