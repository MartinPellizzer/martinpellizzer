<p>Cliffortia serpyllina, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant.</p>
