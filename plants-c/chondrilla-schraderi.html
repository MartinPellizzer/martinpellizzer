                    <h1>Chondrilla schraderi</h1>
<p>Chondrilla schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically perennial, with a low-growing, mat-forming habit that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers appear in summer, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
