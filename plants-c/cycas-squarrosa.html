                    <h1>Cycas squarrosa</h1>
<p>Cycas squarrosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are often fan-shaped. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas squarrosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>
