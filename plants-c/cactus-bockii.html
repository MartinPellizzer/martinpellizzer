                    <h1>Cactus bockii</h1>
<p>Cactus bockii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has spiny stems that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water evaporation.</p>
<p>Cactus bockii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
