                    <h1>Cyphia rupestris</h1>
<p>Cyphia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers that are often pale blue or purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Cyphia rupestris is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils.</p>
