                    <h1>Cheilanthes erythraea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes erythraea, commonly known as the red sandstone fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access moisture from cracks in the soil. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes erythraea plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
