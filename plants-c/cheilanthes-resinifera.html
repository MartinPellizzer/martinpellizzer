                    <h1>Cheilanthes resinifera</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes resinifera, commonly known as the resinous rock fern, is a species of fern found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes resinifera is often found growing on rocky substrates, making it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
