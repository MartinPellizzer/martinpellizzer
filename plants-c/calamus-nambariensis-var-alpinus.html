                    <h1>Calamus nambariensis var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Calamus nambariensis var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine calamus, is a variant of the calamus genus native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, robust plant characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and arching, sword-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests and wetlands. Its flowering is relatively rare, with small, inconspicuous spadices that produce starchy, edible rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
