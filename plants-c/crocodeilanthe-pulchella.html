                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe pulchella</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe pulchella, commonly known as the jewel orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often jewel-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), helping it retain water in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
