                    <h1>Cycas curranii</h1>
<p>Cycas curranii, commonly known as the Curran's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas curranii is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
