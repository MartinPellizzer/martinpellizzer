                    <h1>Cyperus kraussii</h1>
<p>Cyperus kraussii, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, making it a common sight in riparian zones and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus kraussii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and water garden settings.</p>
