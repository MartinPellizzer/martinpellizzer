                    <h1>Cerastium petraeum</h1>
<p>Cerastium petraeum, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Cerastium petraeum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
