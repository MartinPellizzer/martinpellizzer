                    <h1>Crepis biennis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Crepis biennis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth annual hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a single, flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other Crepis species by its lack of pubescence and its shorter, more compact growth habit.</p>
