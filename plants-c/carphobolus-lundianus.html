<p>Carphobolus lundianus, commonly known as the African burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
