                    <h1>Ceratophyllum submersum var. granulosum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum submersum var. granulosum, commonly known as the granular waterwheel plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it can form dense underwater stands.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
