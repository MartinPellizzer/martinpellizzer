                    <h1>Cactus loricatus</h1>
<p>Cactus loricatus, commonly known as the thick-shelled cactus, is a species native to the deserts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems.</p>
