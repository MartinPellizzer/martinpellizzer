                    <h1>Campyloneurum mortonianum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum mortonianum, commonly known as the Morton's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in cool, humid forests.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils in temperate regions.</p>
