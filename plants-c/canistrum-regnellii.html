                    <h1>Canistrum regnellii</h1>
<p>Canistrum regnellii, commonly known as the red-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, forming dense, evergreen foliage that can cover the host's surface. Its berries are orange to red in color and contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Canistrum regnellii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though its parasitic nature can cause damage to its host plants.</p>
