                    <h1>Casuarina distyla var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Casuarina distyla var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate casuarina, is a low-growing shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, woody cones. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are modified into small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss, aiding in its survival in arid or coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The prostrate form of this species allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that stabilize sand dunes.</p>
