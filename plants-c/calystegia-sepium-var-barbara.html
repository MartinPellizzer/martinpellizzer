<p>Calystegia sepium var. barbara, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant has a climbing habit and can spread aggressively, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence the common name.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its spread in various habitats.</p>
