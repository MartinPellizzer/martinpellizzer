                    <h1>Cuscuta aphylla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta aphylla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in small, scale-like structures that help it attach to host plants. It is found in various regions, including North America and parts of Europe, and thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
