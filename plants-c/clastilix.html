                    <h1>Clastilix</h1>
<p>Clastilix, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are small and spiny, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Clastilix thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
