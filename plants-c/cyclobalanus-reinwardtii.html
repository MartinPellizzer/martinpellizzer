<p>Cyclobalanus reinwardtii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark, almost black bark and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
