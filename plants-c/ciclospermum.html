                    <h1>Ciclospermum</h1>
<p>Ciclospermum, commonly known as the spiral spore plant, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, with a spiral arrangement of the leaflets. They produce small, floating spores that are dispersed by water currents, aiding in their propagation. Ciclospermum species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical structure includes rhizomes that anchor the plant and support the growth of the floating leaves.</p>
