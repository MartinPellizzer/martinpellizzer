                    <h1>Centipeda nidiformis</h1>
<p>Centipeda nidiformis, commonly known as the nest-shaped centipede plant, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-like growth pattern, with leaves arranged in a compact, nest-like formation. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces delicate, yellowish flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a subtle ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
