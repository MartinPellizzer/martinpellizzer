<p>Campyloneurum trichiatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
