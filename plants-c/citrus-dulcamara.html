                    <h1>Citrus dulcamara</h1>
<p>Citrus dulcamara, commonly known as the wild citrus or the woody nightshade, is a plant that is often confused with true citrus species.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or vine native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant has small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>While not a true citrus, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
