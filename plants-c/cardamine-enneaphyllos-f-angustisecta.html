                    <h1>Cardamine enneaphyllos f. angustisecta</h1>
<p>Cardamine enneaphyllos f. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a rare fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cardamine. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, contributing to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preference.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic insect populations.</p>
