<p>Coleotrype synanthera, commonly known as the coral-like lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus that resembles coral in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
