                    <h1>Crabbea robusta</h1>
<p>Crabbea robusta, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a South African plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces a fleshy, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Crabbea robusta is well-suited for rock gardens and dry climates due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
