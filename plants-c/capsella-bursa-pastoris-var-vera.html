                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. vera</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. vera, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical, three-lobed seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies.</p>
