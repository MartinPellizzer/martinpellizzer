<p>Coryphantha clavata, commonly known as the clustered pincushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular growth habit and small, spiny stems that often form clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha clavata is well-suited for rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
