<p>Capriola incompleta, commonly known as the incomplete capriola, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capriola incompleta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
