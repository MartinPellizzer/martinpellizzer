<p>Crepidium prasinum, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
