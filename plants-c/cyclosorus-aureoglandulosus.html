                    <h1>Cyclosorus aureoglandulosus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus aureoglandulosus, commonly known as the golden glandular cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in golden-yellow glands, giving it its common name. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus aureoglandulosus is primarily distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
