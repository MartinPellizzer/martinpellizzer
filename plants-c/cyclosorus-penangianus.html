                    <h1>Cyclosorus penangianus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an important indicator species for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems.</p>
