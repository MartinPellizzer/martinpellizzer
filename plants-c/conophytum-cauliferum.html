<p>Conophytum cauliferum, commonly known as the "Bottle Plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It grows in a compact, rosette form, often resembling a bottle or a cactus.</p>
<p>Conophytum cauliferum is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
