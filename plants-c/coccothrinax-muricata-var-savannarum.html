                    <h1>Coccothrinax muricata var. savannarum</h1>
<p>Coccothrinax muricata var. savannarum, commonly known as the Cuban palm or the savanna palm, is a robust, medium-sized palm native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical C. muricata due to its slightly different growth habit and habitat preferences.</p>
