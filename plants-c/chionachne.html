                    <h1>Chionachne</h1>
<p>Chionachne, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale blue, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Chionachne plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats.</p>
