                    <h1>Corallorhiza patens</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza patens, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal networks for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
