                    <h1>Convolvulus scoparius</h1>
<p>Convolvulus scoparius, commonly known as the sand mat or desert morning glory, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in harsh environments.</p>
