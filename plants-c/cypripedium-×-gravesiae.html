                    <h1>Cypripedium × gravesiae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × gravesiae, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium reginae, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant produces a single, showy, slipper-shaped flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure that serves as a pollination trap. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
