                    <h1>Cotula paludosa</h1>
<p>Cotula paludosa, commonly known as swamp sandwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically features small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in damp environments. The plant thrives in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Cotula paludosa is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it a common pioneer species in wetland succession.</p>
