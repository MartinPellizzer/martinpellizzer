<p>Crocodilodes biloba, commonly known as the African sand orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it store water for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
