                    <h1>Cheilanthes viridis var. obscura</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viridis var. obscura, commonly known as the dark green rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical *Cheilanthes viridis* by its darker coloration and slightly different frond morphology.</p>
