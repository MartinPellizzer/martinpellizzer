                    <h1>Chrysophyllum hoehnei</h1>
<p>Chrysophyllum hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy foliage and unique fruit morphology, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific tropical conditions to thrive.</p>
