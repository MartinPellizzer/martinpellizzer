                    <h1>Carex haematopus</h1>
<p>Carex haematopus, commonly known as the bloodstained sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>Carex haematopus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter contaminated water.</p>
