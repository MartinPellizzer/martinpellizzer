<p>Caiophora mandoniana, commonly known as the Mandon's caiophora, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, glossy dark green leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
