<p>Cedrelopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It has a compact, conical shape with dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
