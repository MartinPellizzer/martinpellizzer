                    <h1>Conyza junghuhniana</h1>
<p>Conyza junghuhniana, commonly known as the slenderleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, white to yellowish flowers that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Conyza junghuhniana is also known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas.</p>
