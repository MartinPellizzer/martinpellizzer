<p>Chnoophora humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties.</p>
