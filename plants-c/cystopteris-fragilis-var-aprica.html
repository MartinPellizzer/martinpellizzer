                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. aprica</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. aprica, commonly known as the spring brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, frond-like leaves that are typically light green and have a brittle texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and short lifespan make it a common indicator species in early successional habitats.</p>
