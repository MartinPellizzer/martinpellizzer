                    <h1>Crepidopteris werneri</h1>
<p>Crepidopteris werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hairy pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
