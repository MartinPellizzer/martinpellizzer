<p>Caralluma darfurensis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, often spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Caralluma darfurensis is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some desert communities.</p>
