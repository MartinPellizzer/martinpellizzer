<p>Cardamine glauca subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Cardamine genus.</p>
