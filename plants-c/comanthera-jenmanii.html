                    <h1>Comanthera jenmanii</h1>
<p>Comanthera jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that supports a single or few flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comanthera jenmanii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
