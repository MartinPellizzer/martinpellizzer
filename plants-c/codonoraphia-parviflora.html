                    <h1>Codonoraphia parviflora</h1>
<p>Codonoraphia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered codonoraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and compact, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture that helps retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Codonoraphia parviflora is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
