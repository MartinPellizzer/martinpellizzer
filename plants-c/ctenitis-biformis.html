<p>Ctenitis biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed ctenitis, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Cystophycaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus that forms a dense, bushy structure. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central axis and lateral branches that bear spore-bearing structures called conceptacles. It thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters, often found on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal via water currents, facilitating its spread in marine environments.</p>
