                    <h1>Ctenopterella macrorhyncha</h1>
<p>Ctenopterella macrorhyncha, commonly known as the large-rhynched fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopterella macrorhyncha is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
