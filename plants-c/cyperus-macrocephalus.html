                    <h1>Cyperus macrocephalus</h1>
<p>Cyperus macrocephalus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus macrocephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
