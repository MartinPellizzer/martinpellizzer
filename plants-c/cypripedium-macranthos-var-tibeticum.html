                    <h1>Cypripedium macranthos var. tibeticum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium macranthos var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
