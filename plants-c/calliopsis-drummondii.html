<p>Calliopsis drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Calliopsis drummondii is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the painted lady.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in supporting pollinators and native wildlife makes it a valuable component of its native ecosystems.</p>
