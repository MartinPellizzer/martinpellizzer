<p>Carya glabra subsp.</p>
<p>megacarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust nuts compared to other hickory species.</p>
