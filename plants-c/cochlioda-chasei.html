                    <h1>Cochlioda chasei</h1>
<p>Cochlioda chasei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cochlioda chasei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
