                    <h1>Cattleya × veriflora</h1>
<p>Cattleya × veriflora, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya moschata.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically broad and leathery.</p>
<p>Cattleya × veriflora is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated for its vibrant blooms.</p>
