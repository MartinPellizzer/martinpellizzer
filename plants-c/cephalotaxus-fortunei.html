<p>Cephalotaxus fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, dense, conical crown with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic and structural qualities.</p>
