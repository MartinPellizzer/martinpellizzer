<p>Chlorospatha croatiana subsp.</p>
<p>enneaphylla, commonly known as the Croatian green fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across its native range in Croatia and neighboring regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining ecological balance in forest ecosystems.</p>
