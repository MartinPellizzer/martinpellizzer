                    <h1>Cactus villosus</h1>
<p>Cactus villosus, commonly known as the hairy cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Cactus villosus is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
