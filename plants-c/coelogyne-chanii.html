<p>Coelogyne chanii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Coelogyne chanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
