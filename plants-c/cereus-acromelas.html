<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom at night. These flowers are followed by small, dark red fruits containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>Cereus acromelas is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily during the night.</p>
