                    <h1>Calamagrostis gigantea</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis gigantea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching leaves and can grow up to 6 feet in height, making it a striking addition to landscapes. The plant produces feathery, silver-gray plumes in late summer, which are both ornamental and beneficial for pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found near water bodies such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to erosion control in wetland environments.</p>
