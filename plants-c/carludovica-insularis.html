                    <h1>Carludovica insularis</h1>
<p>Carludovica insularis, commonly known as the Culebra plant, is a rare succulent native to the island of Culebra in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in the arid, rocky coastal environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Carludovica insularis is considered endangered.</p>
