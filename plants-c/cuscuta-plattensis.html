                    <h1>Cuscuta plattensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta plattensis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling growth habit, often covering its host with a dense network of stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is native to North America and can be found on various plants such as grasses, shrubs, and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural and ecological settings.</p>
