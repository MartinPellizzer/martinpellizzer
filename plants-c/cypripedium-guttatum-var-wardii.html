                    <h1>Cypripedium guttatum var. wardii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium guttatum var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or red with contrasting markings. The plant has a long rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist habitats and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
