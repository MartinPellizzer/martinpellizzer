                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata f. aurea</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata f. aurea, commonly known as the golden coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from fungal networks rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll, resulting in its pale yellow to golden coloration. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its flowers are showy, with tubular petals and a distinctive yellowish-orange hue, making it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
