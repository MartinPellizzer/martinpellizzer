                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its tangled, thread-like stems. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy covering, which gives it its common name. It is often found growing on a variety of host plants, including weeds and agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to plants it infests.</p>
