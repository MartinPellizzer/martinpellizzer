<p>Cereus atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert cacti. Its adaptations include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and deep roots to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Cereus atacamensis is well-suited to extreme desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
