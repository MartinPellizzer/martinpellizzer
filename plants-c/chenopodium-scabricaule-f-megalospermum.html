<p>Chenopodium scabricaule f. megalospermum, commonly known as the giant-seeded goosefoot, is a variant of the goosefoot plant characterized by its large, fleshy seeds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly Chile. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are erect and branched.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique seed morphology and potential uses in traditional medicine or agriculture.</p>
