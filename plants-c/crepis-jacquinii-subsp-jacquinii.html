<p>Crepis jacquinii subsp.</p>
<p>jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
