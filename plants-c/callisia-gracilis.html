                    <h1>Callisia gracilis</h1>
<p>Callisia gracilis, commonly known as the silver sword or slender spider plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on slender stems, which are followed by cylindrical, pale green fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage rather than its flowers, and it is relatively low maintenance.</p>
