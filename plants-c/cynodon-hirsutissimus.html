<p>Cynodon hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer months. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
