                    <h1>Cressa aphylla</h1>
<p>Cressa aphylla, commonly known as the hairless cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, though the species name "aphylla" suggests a reduction or absence of these hairs in some populations.</p>
<p>Cressa aphylla is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
