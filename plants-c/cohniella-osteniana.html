                    <h1>Cohniella osteniana</h1>
<p>Cohniella osteniana, commonly known as the Ostenian cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cohniella osteniana is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
