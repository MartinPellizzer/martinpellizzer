<p>Colutea linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily legumes, to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are arranged in racemes, adding visual interest to the plant. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
