                    <h1>Cranfillia deplanchei</h1>
<p>Cranfillia deplanchei, commonly known as the Deplanche's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the dry, rocky regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Cranfillia deplanchei is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it reproduces through seeds rather than spores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
