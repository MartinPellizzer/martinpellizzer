<p>Ceanothus greggii subsp.</p>
<p>vestitus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, woolly hairs covering the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
