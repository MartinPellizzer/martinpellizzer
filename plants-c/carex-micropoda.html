                    <h1>Carex micropoda</h1>
<p>Carex micropoda, commonly known as the small-fruited sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Carex micropoda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
