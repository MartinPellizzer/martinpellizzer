                    <h1>Cyanococcus pallidus</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus pallidus, commonly known as the pale blue moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and pale blue-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoids. This plant thrives in dry, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in sandy soils. Cyanococcus pallidus is well adapted to arid conditions, with a thick, water-retentive thallus that helps it survive in low-moisture habitats.</p>
<p>Its small, leaf-like structures are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
