<p>Chamaerops acaulis, commonly known as the spineless date palm, is a species of palm native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender plant that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with a slender trunk and feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its lack of spines on the leaf bases, distinguishing it from other Chamaerops species. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is not as prominent as in other date palms.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
