<p>Chilita viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck's chilita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita viereckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
