<p>Cydonia silvestris var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf quince, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, green fruits that ripen to a golden-orange color in late summer. The plant has a bushy growth habit with rough, warty bark and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its fruits are often used in cooking, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to common quinces.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
