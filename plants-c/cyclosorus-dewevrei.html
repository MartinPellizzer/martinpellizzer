                <h1>Cyclosorus dewevrei</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus dewevrei, commonly known as the Dewevre's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It has a short, inconspicuous stem and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
