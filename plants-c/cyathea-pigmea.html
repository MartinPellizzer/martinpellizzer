<p>Cyathea pigmea, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright fronds that give it a tree-like appearance despite its small size. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a glossy, dark green coloration.</p>
<p>Cyathea pigmea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
