                    <h1>Colanthelia</h1>
<p>Colanthelia, commonly known as the coral-like liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, leaf-like structures that often form dense, cushion-like growths. Colanthelia species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their morphology includes a thalloid body with distinct lobes and a network of channels that facilitate water and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its unique reproductive structures, including small, spore-producing capsules that are often clustered at the tips of the lobes.</p>
