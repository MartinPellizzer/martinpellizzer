                    <h1>Colchicum alpinum</h1>
<p>Colchicum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal, arrow-shaped, and often remain green throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Colchicum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and rocky areas at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
