                    <h1>Camellia sinensis f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Camellia sinensis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf camellia, is a botanical variant of the tea plant characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the standard Camellia sinensis.</p>
<p>This cultivar is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. It produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the winter, adding to its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
<p>While not typically used for tea production, it shares genetic similarities with the tea plant and is sometimes used in horticultural research.</p>
