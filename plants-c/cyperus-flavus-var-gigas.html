The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
