                    <h1>Comatoglossum</h1>
<p>Comatoglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, often with a pale or translucent appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Comatoglossum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
