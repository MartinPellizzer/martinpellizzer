                    <h1>Calusparassus</h1>
<p>Calusparassus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
