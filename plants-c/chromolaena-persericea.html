                    <h1>Chromolaena persericea</h1>
<p>Chromolaena persericea, commonly known as white chromolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests, and is often considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a notable ecological concern.</p>
