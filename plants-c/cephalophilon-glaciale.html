                    <h1>Cephalophilon glaciale</h1>
<p>Cephalophilon glaciale, commonly known as the glacier crownflower, is a rare alpine plant native to high-elevation regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head at the end of each stem, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
