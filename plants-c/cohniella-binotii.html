                    <h1>Cohniella binotii</h1>
<p>Cohniella binotii, commonly known as the two-banded lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned thallus, with a darker upper layer and a lighter lower layer. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to lichenologists and ecologists studying biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>
