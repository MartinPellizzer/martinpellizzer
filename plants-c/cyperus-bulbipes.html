<p>Cyperus bulbipes, commonly known as the floating spongeplant, is a species of sedge that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spongy root system that helps it float on water surfaces. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Cyperus bulbipes is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
