                            <h1>Campanula Rotundifolia Subsp. Confertifolia</h1>
<p>Campanula rotundifolia subsp. confertifolia is a striking member of the bellflower family known for its delicate, bell-shaped blooms. This subspecies is often found in rocky and coastal environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are rounded and slightly hairy, giving it a unique appearance that sets it apart from other campanulas. The flowers, which range from blue to purple, bloom in late summer and attract a variety of pollinators. Despite its beauty, this plant is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
