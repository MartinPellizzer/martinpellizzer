<p>Clinopodium vulgare, commonly known as caraway, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, aromatic fruits called mericarps. These fruits contain essential oils that give the plant its distinctive licorice-like aroma.</p>
<p>Clinopodium vulgare is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
