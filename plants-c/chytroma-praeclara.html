                    <h1>Chytroma praeclara</h1>
<p>Chytroma praeclara, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive bell-shaped flower that resembles a small horn. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the decomposing organic matter in the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Chytroma praeclara is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
