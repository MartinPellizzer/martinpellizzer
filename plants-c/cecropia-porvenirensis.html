                    <h1>Cecropia porvenirensis</h1>
<p>Cecropia porvenirensis, commonly known as the Porvenirensis ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its trunk is often covered in a thick, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cecropia porvenirensis is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession.</p>
