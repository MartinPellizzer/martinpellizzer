                    <h1>Culcasia liberica</h1>
<p>Culcasia liberica, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many water bodies, often outcompeting native plants.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in some cultures.</p>
