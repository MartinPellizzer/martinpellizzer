                    <h1>Cryophytum dejagerae</h1>
<p>Cryophytum dejagerae, commonly known as the De Jager's frost plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow during the brief rainy season. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
