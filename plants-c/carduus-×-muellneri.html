                    <h1>Carduus × muellneri</h1>
<p>Carduus × muellneri, commonly known as the German thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus benedictus and Carduus marianus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk flowers, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to establish dense stands.</p>
