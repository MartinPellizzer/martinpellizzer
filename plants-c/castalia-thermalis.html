                    <h1>Castalia thermalis</h1>
<p>Castalia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal castalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific geothermal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, mineral-laden soils found near hot springs and volcanic areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand high temperatures and mineral-rich environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for geothermal activity.</p>
