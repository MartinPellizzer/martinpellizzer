                    <h1>Caballeria pellucida</h1>
<p>Caballeria pellucida, commonly known as the glassy leaf or glassy plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
