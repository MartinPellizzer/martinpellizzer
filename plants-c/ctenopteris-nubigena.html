                    <h1>Ctenopteris nubigena</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that gives the plant its ethereal look. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of interest for researchers studying fern evolution.</p>
