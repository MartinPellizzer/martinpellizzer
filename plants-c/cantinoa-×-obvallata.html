                    <h1>Cantinoa × obvallata</h1>
<p>Cantinoa × obvallata, commonly known as the hybrid sweet potato, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Ipomoea batatas* (sweet potato) and *Ipomoea obvallata* (a wild morning glory).</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including vigorous growth and the ability to produce edible tubers. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trailing vines, which can reach lengths of several meters. Its tubers vary in color, ranging from white to yellow and even purple, depending on the variety.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, Cantinoa × obvallata is of interest in agricultural research for improving sweet potato cultivars.</p>
