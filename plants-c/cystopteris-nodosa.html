                    <h1>Cystopteris nodosa</h1>
<p>Cystopteris nodosa, commonly known as the nodding water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The fronds are divided into small, pinnate segments and often have a reddish tinge when submerged. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystems.</p>
