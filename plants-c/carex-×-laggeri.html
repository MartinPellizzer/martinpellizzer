<p>Carex × laggeri, commonly known as the hybrid marsh sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex sanguinea, often found in wetland environments. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, such as marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
