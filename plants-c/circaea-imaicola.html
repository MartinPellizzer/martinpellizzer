                    <h1>Circaea imaicola</h1>
<p>Circaea imaicola, commonly known as the coastal chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by tiny, round berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Circaea imaicola plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
