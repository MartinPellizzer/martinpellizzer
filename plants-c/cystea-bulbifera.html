<p>Cystea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are flexible and branching.</p>
<p>Cystea bulbifera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
