                    <h1>Cymbachne amplectens subvar. pohliana</h1>
<p>Cymbachne amplectens subvar. pohliana, commonly known as the creeping grass or pohliana grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, grass-like texture.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that produce minute seeds, facilitating its spread through wind dispersal.</p>
