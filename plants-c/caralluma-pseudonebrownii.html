                    <h1>Caralluma pseudonebrownii</h1>
<p>Caralluma pseudonebrownii, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spine-tipped, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma pseudonebrownii is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
