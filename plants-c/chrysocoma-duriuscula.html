                    <h1>Chrysocoma duriuscula</h1>
<p>Chrysocoma duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved chrysocoma, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>Chrysocoma duriuscula is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
