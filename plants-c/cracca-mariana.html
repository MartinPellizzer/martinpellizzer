                    <h1>Cracca mariana</h1>
<p>Cracca mariana, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in damp environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
