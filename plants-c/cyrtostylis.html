                    <h1>Cyrtostylis</h1>
<p>Cyrtostylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Cyrtostylis species are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered.</p>
