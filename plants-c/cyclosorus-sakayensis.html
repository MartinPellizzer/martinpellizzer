                    <h1>Cyclosorus sakayensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus sakayensis, commonly known as the Sakay's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including tiny spore-producing organs, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
