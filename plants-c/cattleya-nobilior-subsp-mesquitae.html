<p>Cattleya nobilior subsp.</p>
<p>mesquitae, commonly known as the Mesquitae Cattleya, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. This subspecies is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive white throat.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative ease of cultivation under proper conditions.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
