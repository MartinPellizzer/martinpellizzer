                    <h1>Crenulluma</h1>
<p>Crenulluma, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and shallow root systems. Crenulluma species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry climates.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and resilience make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
