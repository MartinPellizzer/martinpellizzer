<p>Cactus bleo, commonly known as the "blue cactus" or *Euphorbia bleo*, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers during the growing season, which are followed by small, greenish seed pods. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, providing some protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
