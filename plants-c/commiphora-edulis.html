                <h1>Commiphora edulis</h1>
<p>Commiphora edulis, commonly known as the edible myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant's leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, and it relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in its native habitat.</p>
