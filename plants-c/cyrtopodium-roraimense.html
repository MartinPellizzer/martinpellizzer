                    <h1>Cyrtopodium roraimense</h1>
<p>Cyrtopodium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima candle or Roraima orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of showy, candle-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the highland plateaus, where it relies on epiphytic growth on rock faces and tree trunks. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
