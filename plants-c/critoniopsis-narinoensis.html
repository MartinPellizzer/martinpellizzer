                    <h1>Critoniopsis narinoensis</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis narinoensis, commonly known as the Narino starling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically pale yellow with a contrasting purple or brown lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small size and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring protection.</p>
