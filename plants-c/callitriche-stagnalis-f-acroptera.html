                    <h1>Callitriche stagnalis f. acroptera</h1>
<p>Callitriche stagnalis f. acroptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, floating or submerged leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a distinct midrib, and are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the ends of the stems, and it is often found in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
