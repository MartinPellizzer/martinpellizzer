                    <h1>Claytonia litoralis</h1>
<p>Claytonia litoralis, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>Claytonia litoralis is an important species for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
