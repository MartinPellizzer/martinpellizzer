                            <h1>Chamaecrista Calycioides</h1>
<p>Coral bean, scientifically known as Chamaecrista calycioides, is a striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is renowned for its vibrant, coral-pink to red bracts that resemble delicate clusters of coral, giving it its common name. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental and ecological value. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies make it a standout in native plant collections. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in changing environmental conditions.</p>
