<p>Cousinia tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, succulent stems. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions, which help it withstand the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its environment. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, while its flowers are small and often pale in color.</p>
<p>Cousinia tibetica plays a vital role in stabilizing the fragile alpine ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
