<p>Cereus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which are pollinated by moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
