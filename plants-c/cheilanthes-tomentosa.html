                    <h1>Cheilanthes tomentosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly cliff brake, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit, with fronds that are typically gray-green in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of fine, hairy tissue.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils where few other plants can survive.</p>
