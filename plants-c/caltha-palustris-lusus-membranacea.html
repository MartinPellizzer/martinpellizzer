<p>Caltha palustris lusus membranacea, commonly known as the swamp crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, branching stems that arise from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread across moist soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich water.</p>
