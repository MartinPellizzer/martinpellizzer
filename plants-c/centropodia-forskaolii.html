<p>Centropodia forskaolii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Centropodia forskaolii is well-suited to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its drought-resistant features.</p>
