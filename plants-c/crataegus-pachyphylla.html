                    <h1>Crataegus pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Crataegus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawthorn, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Crataegus pachyphylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
