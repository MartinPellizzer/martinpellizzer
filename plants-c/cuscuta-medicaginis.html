                    <h1>Cuscuta medicaginis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta medicaginis, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found growing on legumes such as Medicago species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
