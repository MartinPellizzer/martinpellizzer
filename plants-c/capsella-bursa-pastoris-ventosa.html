<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris ventosa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bladder-like seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds when disturbed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and botany.</p>
