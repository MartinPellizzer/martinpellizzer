                    <h1>Caylusea canescens var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Caylusea canescens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems that become smooth as the plant matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine pubescence, while the flowers are small, yellow, and pea-like, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
