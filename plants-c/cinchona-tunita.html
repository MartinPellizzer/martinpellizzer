<p>Cinchona tunita, commonly known as the yellow quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Cinchona tunita is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
