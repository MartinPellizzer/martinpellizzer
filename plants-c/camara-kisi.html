                    <h1>Camara kisi</h1>
<p>Camara kisi, commonly known as the nightshade or black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Its small, clustered flowers are typically purple or blue, giving way to berries that are toxic when ripe.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes.</p>
