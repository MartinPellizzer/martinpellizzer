<p>Chaetospora distans, commonly known as the slender haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with branching stems covered in short, stiff hairs. Its sporophytes are typically small and develop on the tips of the stems, producing capsules for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Chaetospora distans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
