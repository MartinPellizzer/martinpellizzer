<p>Castilleja trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined stork's bill, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Castilleja trinervis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands.</p>
