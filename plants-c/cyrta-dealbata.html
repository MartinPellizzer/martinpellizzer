<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones rather than flowers, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
