                    <h1>Cyclosorus triphyllus var. parishii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus triphyllus var. parishii, commonly known as the three-leaf water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant's rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of its habitat. Its small, spore-bearing structures are typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
