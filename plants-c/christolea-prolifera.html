<p>Christolea prolifera, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
