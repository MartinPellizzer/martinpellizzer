<p>Commiphora fragariifolia, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes.
