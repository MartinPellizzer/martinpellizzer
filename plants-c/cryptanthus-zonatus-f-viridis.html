<p>Cryptanthus zonatus f. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Carpet.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is a compact, low-growing species with dense foliage that forms a lush, carpet-like appearance. Its leaves are typically broad, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which appear above the foliage during the growing season.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
