                    <h1>Coronopus</h1>
<p>Coronopus, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions, including North America, where it is often used for soil stabilization. Coronopus has a deep root system that helps prevent erosion and can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
