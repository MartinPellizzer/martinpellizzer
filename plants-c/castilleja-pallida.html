                <h1>Castilleja pallida</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida, commonly known as the pale Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange inflorescences that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja pallida plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with native grasses and forbs.</p>
