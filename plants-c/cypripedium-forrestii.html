                    <h1>Cypripedium forrestii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium forrestii, commonly known as the Forrest's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink and white flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single flower per stem, often with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
