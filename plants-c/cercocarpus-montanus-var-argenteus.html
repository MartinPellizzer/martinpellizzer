<p>Cercocarpus montanus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, red to orange berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
