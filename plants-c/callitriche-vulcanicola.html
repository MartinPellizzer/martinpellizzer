<p>Callitriche vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic water-star, is a rare aquatic plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high mineral content, often found near geothermal springs. The plant has small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for volcanic soil and thermal activity.</p>
