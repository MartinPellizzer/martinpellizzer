                    <h1>Cactus reptans</h1>
<p>Cactus reptans, commonly known as the creeping cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling structure with cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus reptans is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
