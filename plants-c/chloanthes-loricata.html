                    <h1>Chloanthes loricata</h1>
<p>Chloanthes loricata, commonly known as the woolly ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or white, are small and clustered in a spike, giving it an ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chloanthes loricata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
