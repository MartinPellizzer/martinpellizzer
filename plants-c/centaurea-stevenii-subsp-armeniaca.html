<p>Centaurea stevenii subsp.</p>
<p>armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its spiny leaves and bright purple to blue flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open grasslands and shrublands, where it competes with other native flora.</p>
