                    <h1>Cleghornia chinensis</h1>
<p>Cleghornia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cleghorn, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleghornia chinensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
