                    <h1>Cladium capillaceum</h1>
<p>Cladium capillaceum, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cladium capillaceum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
