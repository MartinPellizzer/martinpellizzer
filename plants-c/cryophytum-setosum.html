                    <h1>Cryophytum setosum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum setosum, commonly known as the hairy cryptophyte, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and hairy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental needs, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
