<p>Cistanche tubulosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Chinese parasitic vine, is a halophytic plant native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic species that attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily within the family Fabaceae. The plant is characterized by its yellow to orange tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are woody and branched, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported tonic properties.</p>
