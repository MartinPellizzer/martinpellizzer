                    <h1>Corallorhiza halleri</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza halleri, commonly known as the Haller's coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll.</p>
<p>This characteristic makes it a mycoheterotroph, relying entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific tree species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
