                    <h1>Chloroleucon extortum</h1>
<p>Chloroleucon extortum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in harsh environments with poor soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Chloroleucon extortum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky areas.</p>
