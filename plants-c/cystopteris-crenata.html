                    <h1>Cystopteris crenata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, and the fronds can spread out to form a dense mat on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Cystopteris crenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
