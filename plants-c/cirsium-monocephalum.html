                    <h1>Cirsium monocephalum</h1>
<p>Cirsium monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and open areas.</p>
<p>Cirsium monocephalum is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
