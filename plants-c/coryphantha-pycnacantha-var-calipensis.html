<p>Coryphantha pycnacantha var. calipensis, commonly known as the Calipense Hedgehog Cactus, is a succulent native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens.</p>
