<p>Choriceras majus, commonly known as the giant sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its large, soft body and distinctive coloration. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. It feeds primarily on algae and other plant matter, playing a role in marine ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its reproductive system involves external fertilization, with eggs laid in gelatinous masses in the water.</p>
