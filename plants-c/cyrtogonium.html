                    <h1>Cyrtogonium</h1>
<p>Cyrtogonium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in wet environments such as marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. Cyrtogonium species are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating. The rhizomes of these ferns are usually submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
