<p>Chasseloupia tinctoria, commonly known as the redroot nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns from green to red as it matures, and it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has historical uses in dye production due to its vivid pigments.</p>
