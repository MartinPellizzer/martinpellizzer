                    <h1>Charianthus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Charianthus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky areas or along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
