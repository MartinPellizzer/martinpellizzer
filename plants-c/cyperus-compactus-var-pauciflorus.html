                    <h1>Cyperus compactus var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Cyperus compactus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its low-growing form and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
