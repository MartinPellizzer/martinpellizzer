<p>Cardamine pratensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and stream sides in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stems.
