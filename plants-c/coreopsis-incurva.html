<p>Coreopsis incurva, commonly known as the curly coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with prominent white centers, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slight curl, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Coreopsis incurva is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens.</p>
