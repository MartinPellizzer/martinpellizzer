<p>Carex squarrosa var. typhinoides, commonly known as the Typhinoides sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
