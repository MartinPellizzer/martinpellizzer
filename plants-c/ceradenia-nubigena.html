                    <h1>Ceradenia nubigena</h1>
<p>Ceradenia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests where it clings to rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-producing capsules that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceradenia nubigena is considered a conservation concern.</p>
