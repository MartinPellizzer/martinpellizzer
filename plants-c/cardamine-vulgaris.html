                    <h1>Cardamine vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cardamine vulgaris, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually broad and slightly heart-shaped, and small white or greenish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
