<p>Connarus subinaequifolius, commonly known as the unequal-leaved connarus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Connarus subinaequifolius is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories and is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology.</p>
