                    <h1>Cystopteris leucosoria</h1>
<p>Cystopteris leucosoria, commonly known as the white wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
