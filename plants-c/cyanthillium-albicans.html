                    <h1>Cyanthillium albicans</h1>
<p>Cyanthillium albicans, commonly known as the white ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cyanthillium albicans is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
