                    <h1>Ctenopteris pendens</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris pendens, commonly known as the hanging sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that drape gracefully from its base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the ocean, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its saline environment.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris pendens plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
