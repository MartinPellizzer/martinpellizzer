                    <h1>Cordia curassavica</h1>
<p>Cordia curassavica, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and succulent, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
