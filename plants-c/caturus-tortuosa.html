                    <h1>Caturus tortuosa</h1>
<p>Caturus tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a branching, sprawling stem that often grows in a twisted or contorted manner, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Caturus tortuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
