                    <h1>Cuscuta deltoidea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta deltoidea, commonly known as the delta dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination and attachment to a host. The plant forms a dense network of stems around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found in disturbed areas and can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and horticultural systems.</p>
