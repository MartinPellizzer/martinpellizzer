                    <h1>Calligonum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Calligonum coriaceum, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of extreme drought.</p>
<p>Calligonum coriaceum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
