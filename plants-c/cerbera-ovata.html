                    <h1>Cerbera ovata</h1>
<p>Cerbera ovata, commonly known as the poison apple or white coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green to white bark and its striking, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of cardioactive glycosides. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Cerbera ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires caution due to its toxic properties.</p>
