<p>Catasetum arietinum, commonly known as the Red Vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and green foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a "lip" that aids in pollination by specific wasps.</p>
<p>Catasetum arietinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
