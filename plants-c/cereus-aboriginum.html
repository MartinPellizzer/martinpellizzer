                    <h1>Cereus aboriginum</h1>
<p>Cereus aboriginum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its striking, ephemeral blooms and its ability to adapt to harsh desert conditions.</p>
