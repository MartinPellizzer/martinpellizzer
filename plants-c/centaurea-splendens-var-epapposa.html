                    <h1>Centaurea splendens var. epapposa</h1>
<p>Centaurea splendens var. epapposa, commonly known as the purple gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, purple to pink florets that resemble those of a gladiolus. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for the main flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn.</p>
