                    <h1>Callitris cupressiformis var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Callitris cupressiformis var. mucronata, commonly known as the smooth-barked white cypress, is a species of conifer native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and its distinctive, smooth, pale bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
