                    <h1>Chenopodium × zobelii</h1>
<p>Chenopodium × zobelii, commonly known as hybrid goosefoot, is a species resulting from the cross between Chenopodium album and Chenopodium berlandieri.</p>
<p>It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit and alternate leaves that are typically succulent and ovate. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Chenopodium × zobelii is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and other disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
