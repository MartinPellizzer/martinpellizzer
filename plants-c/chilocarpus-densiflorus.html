<p>Chilocarpus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower chilocarpus, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a rough, bark-like texture on its stems and produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in maritime forests and along rocky shores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
