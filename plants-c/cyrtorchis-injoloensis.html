<p>Cyrtorchis injoloensis, commonly known as the Injolo orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich soil, and it has a short growing season due to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for this species, as it is threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
