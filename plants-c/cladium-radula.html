                    <h1>Cladium radula</h1>
<p>Cladium radula, commonly known as the swamp cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in saturated soil conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cladium radula plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of marsh ecosystems.</p>
