                    <h1>Capellenia</h1>
<p>Capellenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Capellenia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
