                    <h1>Conchium mucronatum</h1>
<p>Conchium mucronatum, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy rosettes of leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conchium mucronatum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
