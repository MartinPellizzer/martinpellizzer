<p>Coniogramme argutiserrata, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex structure that supports its photosynthetic function.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
