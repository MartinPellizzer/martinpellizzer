                    <h1>Ctenitis omeiensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei cliff fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated edge and a unique, creeping growth habit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs and slopes. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis omeiensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
