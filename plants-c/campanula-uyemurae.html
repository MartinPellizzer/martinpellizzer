<p>Campanula uyemurae, commonly known as the Uyemura bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanula uyemurae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
