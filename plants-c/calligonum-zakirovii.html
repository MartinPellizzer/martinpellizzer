<p>Calligonum zakirovii, commonly known as the Zakirov's tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for land reclamation projects.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures contributes to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
