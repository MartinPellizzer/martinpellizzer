                    <h1>Collomia tinctoria f. subulata</h1>
<p>Collomia tinctoria f. subulata, commonly known as the Sierra dwarf flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, subulate (awl-shaped) leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
