<p>Corchorus bricchettii, commonly known as the desert cotton or woolly dock, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous stems, it has been historically used for textile production in some regions.</p>
