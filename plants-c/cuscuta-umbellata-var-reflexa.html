                    <h1>Cuscuta umbellata var. reflexa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta umbellata var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its host plants. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on grasses, legumes, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
