<p>Cereus magnus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a striking cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 15 feet in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, typically during the summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, opening for only a few hours before closing by dawn.</p>
