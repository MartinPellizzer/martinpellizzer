                <h1>Caleana hortiorum</h1>
<p>Caleana hortiorum, commonly known as the honeycomb orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure that resembles a honeycomb, with a central column and surrounding labellum that mimics the appearance of a beehive. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in full sun. Its flowers are pollinated by male wasps, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's labellum.</p>
<p>This specialized adaptation is a fascinating example of plant-insect co-evolution in the plant's natural habitat.</p>
