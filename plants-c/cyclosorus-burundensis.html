<p>Cyclosorus burundensis, commonly known as the Burundi waterwheel, is a rare aquatic fern native to the African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its fronds are typically slender and have a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
