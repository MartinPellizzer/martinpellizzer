<p>Cecropia gabrielis, commonly known as Gabriel's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Cecropia gabrielis is often found in disturbed habitats and plays a significant role in ecological succession in tropical forests.</p>
