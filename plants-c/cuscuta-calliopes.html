                    <h1>Cuscuta calliopes</h1>
<p>Cuscuta calliopes, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
