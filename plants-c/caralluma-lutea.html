<p>Caralluma lutea, commonly known as the yellow devil or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers.
