                    <h1>Carex campyloxys</h1>
<p>Carex campyloxys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Native to wet or moist habitats, it thrives in environments with consistent moisture, such as marshes or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dry berries.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
