                    <h1>Cousinia parviceps</h1>
<p>Cousinia parviceps, commonly known as the dwarf cushion cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia parviceps is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
