                    <h1>Cyclosorus arenicola</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus arenicola, commonly known as the sand cyclosorus, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern that thrives in sandy, shallow freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in clusters on the water's surface. The plant's reproductive structures, including its spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive in both still and gently flowing waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
