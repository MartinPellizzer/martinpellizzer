The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but often used in culinary or medicinal applications due to their tart flavor and high vitamin C content.</p>
