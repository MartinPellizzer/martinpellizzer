                    <h1>Clidemia miconiastrum</h1>
<p>Clidemia miconiastrum, commonly known as the creeping miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
