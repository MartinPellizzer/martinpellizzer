<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species well adapted to xeric environments. Its leaves have a tendency to perforate or almost fuse at the base, a trait that gives it its scientific name.</p>
