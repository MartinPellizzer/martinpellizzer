                    <h1>Cusparia trifoliata</h1>
<p>Cusparia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
