                    <h1>Canscora diffusa var. tetraptera</h1>
<p>Canscora diffusa var. tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive four-winged leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
