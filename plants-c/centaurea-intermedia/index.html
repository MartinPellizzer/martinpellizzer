                            <h1>Centaurea Intermedia</h1>
<p>Intermediate centaury, scientifically known as Centaurea intermedia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its common name comes from its resemblance to the mythical centaury, a creature with both human and horse features. Despite its modest appearance, Centaurea intermedia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
