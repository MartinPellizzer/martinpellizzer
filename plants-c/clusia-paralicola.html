                    <h1>Clusia paralicola</h1>
<p>Clusia paralicola, commonly known as the coastal clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, which help it retain moisture in coastal environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its robust root system makes it highly tolerant of salt spray and sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Clusia paralicola is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
