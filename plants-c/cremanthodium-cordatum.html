<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
