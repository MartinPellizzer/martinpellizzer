                    <h1>Chenopodium subaphyllum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium subaphyllum, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
