                    <h1>Canthium strychnoides</h1>
<p>Canthium strychnoides, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, palmate leaves, and small yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to the presence of strychnine and other alkaloids, it is considered highly poisonous and should be handled with caution.</p>
