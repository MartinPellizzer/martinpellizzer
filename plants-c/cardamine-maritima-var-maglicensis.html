<p>Cardamine maritima var. maglicensis, commonly known as the MagliÄ‡ watercress, is a rare variant of the watercress species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats, often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
