                    <h1>Cordiglottis pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Cordiglottis pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered heart orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique powdery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
