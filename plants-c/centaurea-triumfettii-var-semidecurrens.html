                    <h1>Centaurea triumfettii var. semidecurrens</h1>
<p>Centaurea triumfettii var. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism called elaiophore, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Centaurea species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
