The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia lomatoloba is adapted to thrive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments.</p>
