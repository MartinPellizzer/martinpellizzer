                    <h1>Clermontia tuberculata var. subtuberculata</h1>
<p>Clermontia tuberculata var. subtuberculata, commonly known as the Kona mountain mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, tuberculate stems and leaves, which are adapted to the dry, coastal environments of the Big Island. The plant produces showy, pink or red bracts that enclose small, white flowers, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
