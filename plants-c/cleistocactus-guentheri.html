                <h1>Cleistocactus guentheri</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus guentheri, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nocturnal flowering. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus guentheri is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
