                    <h1>Carex tetanica</h1>
<p>Carex tetanica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex tetanica is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
