                    <h1>Corynophallus leonensis</h1>
<p>Corynophallus leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese coralroot, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Spain.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the energy it needs to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
