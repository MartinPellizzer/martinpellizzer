                    <h1>Ceratozamia miqueliana</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, both contributing to its unique reproductive biology. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a significant subject in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
