                    <h1>Ceratostylis capitata</h1>
<p>Ceratostylis capitata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, upright stem bearing a cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which have a unique hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
