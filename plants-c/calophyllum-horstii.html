<p>Calophyllum horstii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
