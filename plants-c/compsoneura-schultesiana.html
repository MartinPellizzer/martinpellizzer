                    <h1>Compsoneura schultesiana</h1>
<p>Compsoneura schultesiana, commonly known as the Schultes' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has small, scale-like leaves that are often concealed among the host's foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, sticky coating to aid in dispersal by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Compsoneura schultesiana plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
