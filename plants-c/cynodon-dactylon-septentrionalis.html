                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common choice for lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance.</p>
