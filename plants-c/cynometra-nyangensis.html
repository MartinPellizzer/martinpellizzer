                    <h1>Cynometra nyangensis</h1>
<p>Cynometra nyangensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
