                    <h1>Cyperus caducus</h1>
<p>Cyperus caducus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) but is often classified under the sedge family (Cyperaceae) due to its morphological similarities. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets.</p>
<p>Cyperus caducus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
