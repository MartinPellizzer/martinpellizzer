                    <h1>Cycas taitungensis</h1>
<p>Cycas taitungensis, commonly known as the Taitung cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
