                    <h1>Coriaria thymifolia var. undulata</h1>
<p>Coriaria thymifolia var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy coriaria, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic leaves that emit a strong, peppery scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential irritant properties.</p>
<p>The varietal name "undulata" refers to the wavy, undulating edges of its foliage.</p>
