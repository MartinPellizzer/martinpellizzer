                    <h1>Cynorkis tsaratananae</h1>
<p>Cynorkis tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana cycad, is a rare and endangered plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Tsaratanana Massif.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
