                    <h1>Carex distans var. corbiereana</h1>
<p>Carex distans var. corbiereana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the Carex distans species, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Carex distans var. corbiereana is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
