                    <h1>Coryanthes lanata</h1>
<p>Coryanthes lanata, commonly known as the woolly coryanthe, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that includes a labellum and column. The plant has fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with dark markings, and they emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Coryanthes lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it requires careful attention to humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
