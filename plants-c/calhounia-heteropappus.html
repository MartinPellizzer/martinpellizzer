                    <h1>Calhounia heteropappus</h1>
<p>Calhounia heteropappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. Its leaves are typically hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Calhounia heteropappus is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
