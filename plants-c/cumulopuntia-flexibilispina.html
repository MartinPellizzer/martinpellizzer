<p>Cumulopuntia flexibilispina, commonly known as the flexible spiny cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its adaptations include succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Overall, Cumulopuntia flexibilispina exemplifies the resilience and specialized features of desert flora.</p>
