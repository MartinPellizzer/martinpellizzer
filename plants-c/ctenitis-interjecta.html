                    <h1>Ctenitis interjecta</h1>
<p>Ctenitis interjecta, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, layered fronds that give it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which helps attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and visually striking plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
