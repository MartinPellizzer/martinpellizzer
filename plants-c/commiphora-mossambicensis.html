<p>Commiphora mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique myrrh, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
