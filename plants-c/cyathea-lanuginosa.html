<p>Cyathea lanuginosa, commonly known as the flax tree or silky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense layer of soft, silky brown spores. The plant has large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyathea lanuginosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including the spore-bearing cones, are located at the top of the trunk, distinguishing it from other fern species.</p>
