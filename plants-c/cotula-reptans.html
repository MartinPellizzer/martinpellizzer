                    <h1>Cotula reptans</h1>
<p>Cotula reptans, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has thin, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across open ground. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in a fine white bloom, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Cotula reptans is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry, sunny areas.</p>
