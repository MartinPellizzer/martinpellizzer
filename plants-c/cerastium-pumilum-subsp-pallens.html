<p>Cerastium pumilum subsp.</p>
<p>pallens, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
