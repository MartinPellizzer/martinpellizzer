                    <h1>Crepidium glaucum</h1>
<p>Crepidium glaucum, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often growing on rock faces or in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
