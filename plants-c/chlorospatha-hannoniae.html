<p>Chlorospatha hannoniae, commonly known as the Hannon's green fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of its fern classification. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Chlorospatha hannoniae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
