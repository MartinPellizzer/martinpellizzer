                    <h1>Cactus echinus</h1>
<p>Cactus echinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>The cactus echinus is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
