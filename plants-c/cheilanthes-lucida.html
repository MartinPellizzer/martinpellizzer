<p>Cheilanthes lucida, commonly known as the shining lip fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green, glossy fronds that are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, making it well adapted to rocky and dry habitats. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes lucida is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
