                    <h1>Cleistopholis brevipetala</h1>
<p>Cleistopholis brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petaled cleistopholis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that are typically enclosed within their buds, a feature common in cleistogamous species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistopholis brevipetala is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
