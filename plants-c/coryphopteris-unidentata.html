                <h1>Coryphopteris unidentata</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris unidentata, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to form dense clumps, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional practices and can be a significant component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
