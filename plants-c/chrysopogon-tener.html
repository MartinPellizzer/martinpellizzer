                    <h1>Chrysopogon tener</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon tener, commonly known as slender goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
