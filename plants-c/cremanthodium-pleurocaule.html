                    <h1>Cremanthodium pleurocaule</h1>
<p>Cremanthodium pleurocaule, commonly known as the purple ghost flower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically solitary and have a unique, ghostly appearance due to their pale coloration and delicate structure.</p>
<p>Cremanthodium pleurocaule is a subject of interest for botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
