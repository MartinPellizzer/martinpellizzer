                    <h1>Cassytha filiformis var. puberula</h1>
<p>Cassytha filiformis var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that can twine around its host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing on shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a unique example of parasitic plant adaptation.</p>
