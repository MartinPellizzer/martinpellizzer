                    <h1>Cuscuta gigantea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gigantea, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to North America and can grow on a variety of hosts, including crops and ornamental plants. Its rapid growth and ability to infest large areas make it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Cuscuta gigantea plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant health and biodiversity.</p>
