                            <h1>Citrus Reticulata Subsp. Tachibana</h1>
<p>Tachibana, scientifically known as Citrus reticulata subsp. tachibana, is a small evergreen citrus tree native to southern Japan. It is prized for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is both edible and fragrant. The tree is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its compact size and resilience to urban environments. Its leaves are glossy and its flowers are fragrant, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. Despite its modest size, the Tachibana holds cultural and culinary significance in East Asian traditions.</p>
