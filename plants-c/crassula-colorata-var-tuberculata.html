<p>Crassula colorata var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded foliage with small, raised tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
