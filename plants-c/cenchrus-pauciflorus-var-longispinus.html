                    <h1>Cenchrus pauciflorus var. longispinus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus pauciflorus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined sand couch, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with spikelets bearing bristle-like awns. Its drought tolerance and rapid establishment make it a valuable forage species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The long, stiff spines on its seeds aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
