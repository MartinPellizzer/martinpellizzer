<p>Cynorkis seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, narrow spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky or wooded slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
