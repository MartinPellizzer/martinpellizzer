                            <h1>Carpinus Betulus F. Incisa</h1>
<p>European hornbeam, scientifically known as Carpinus betulus f. incisa, is a striking variation of the common hornbeam tree native to Europe. This ornamental plant is characterized by its uniquely shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the horns of a beast, giving it its common name. Often cultivated in gardens and parks, it thrives in shaded environments and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. Its ability to adapt to various soil types makes it a popular choice for landscaping. With its historical significance and ecological benefits, the European hornbeam remains a beloved and enduring plant in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
