                    <h1>Cortia</h1>
<p>Cortia, commonly known as the common lichen, is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal or cyanobacterial partner.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, including tree bark, soil, and rock surfaces, where it forms a symbiotic relationship. The structure of Cortia typically consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that can vary in color from yellow to green or brown. It plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a food source for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to survive in harsh conditions, Cortia is often used as an indicator of air quality and environmental change.</p>
