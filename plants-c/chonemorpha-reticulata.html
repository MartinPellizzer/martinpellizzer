<p>Chonemorpha reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming moss-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are closely arranged and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving it its common name. It reproduces via spores produced in capsule-like structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the upper surface of the leaves.</p>
<p>Chonemorpha reticulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
