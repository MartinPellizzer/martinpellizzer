                    <h1>Condylocarpon myrtifolium</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon myrtifolium, commonly known as the myrtle leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil, forming a thin, greenish to yellowish crust. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. It is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
