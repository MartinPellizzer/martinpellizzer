                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. aureoalbum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. aureoalbum, commonly known as the golden white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in montane ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
