<p>Callitriche stagnalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are typically opposite and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often at the water's surface. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through seeds and vegetative propagation via runners.</p>
<p>Callitriche stagnalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
