                    <h1>Cynorkis kassneriana</h1>
<p>Cynorkis kassneriana, commonly known as the Kassner's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Madagascar and parts of the Congo. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
