                    <h1>Coelogyne wettsteiniana</h1>
<p>Coelogyne wettsteiniana, commonly known as the Wettsteinâ€™s orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical rainforest habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
