                    <h1>Cocos coronata var. todari</h1>
<p>Cocos coronata var. todari, commonly known as the Todari coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into hard-shelled fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained sandy soil, and it requires full sun exposure for optimal growth. Its fruit is typically harvested when the outer husk begins to split, revealing the white, fleshy endosperm.</p>
<p>The Todari coconut is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and coastal areas.</p>
