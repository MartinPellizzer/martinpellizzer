<p>Coriophyllus basalticus, commonly known as the basalt leaf plant, is a rare flowering species native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky soil, and it thrives in areas with high mineral content.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
