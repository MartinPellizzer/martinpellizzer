                    <h1>Clidemia granvillei</h1>
<p>Clidemia granvillei, commonly known as the granville's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its specialized roots. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clidemia granvillei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
