                    <h1>Cheirostylis octodactyla</h1>
<p>Cheirostylis octodactyla, commonly known as the eight-fingered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a cluster of small, fragrant flowers with intricate, spurred petals. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
