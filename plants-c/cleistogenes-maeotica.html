                    <h1>Cleistogenes maeotica</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of the Caucasus and Crimea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes maeotica plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems in its native range.</p>
