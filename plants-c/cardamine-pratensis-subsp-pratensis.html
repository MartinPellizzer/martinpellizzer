<p>Cardamine pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>pratensis, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense mat on the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in wet habitats.</p>
