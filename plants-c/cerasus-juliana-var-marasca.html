                    <h1>Cerasus juliana var. marasca</h1>
<p>Cerasus juliana var. marasca, commonly known as the sour cherry or marasca cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, red to black fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they are often used in jams and liqueurs due to their tart flavor. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in early spring. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The marasca cherry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
