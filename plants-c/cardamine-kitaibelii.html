                    <h1>Cardamine kitaibelii</h1>
<p>Cardamine kitaibelii, commonly known as Kitaibel's watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. The plant features trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous, and it often grows in clusters, forming dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other watercress varieties.</p>
