                    <h1>Cordia nesophila</h1>
<p>Cordia nesophila, commonly known as the desert cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Cordia nesophila plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
