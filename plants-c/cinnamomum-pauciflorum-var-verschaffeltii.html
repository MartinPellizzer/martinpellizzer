                    <h1>Cinnamomum pauciflorum var. verschaffeltii</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum pauciflorum var. verschaffeltii, commonly known as the Verschaffelt's cinnamon tree, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cinnamon plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its bark, like other cinnamon species, contains essential oils that contribute to its fragrance and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
