<p>Chiropetalum schiedeanum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser chiropetalum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and intricate floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are usually pale green to white, are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
