                    <h1>Coryphantha</h1>
<p>Coryphantha, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, cylindrical stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick stems and leaves to survive drought conditions. Coryphantha species typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding vibrant color to the desert landscape.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of their native ecosystems.</p>
