<p>Casearia aculeata, commonly known as the prickly casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by ellipsoid fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Casearia aculeata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
