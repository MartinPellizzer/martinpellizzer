                    <h1>Cassytha senegalensis</h1>
<p>Cassytha senegalensis, commonly known as the devil's ivy or swamp dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
