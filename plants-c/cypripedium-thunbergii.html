                    <h1>Cypripedium thunbergii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium thunbergii, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive yellow pouch-like flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
