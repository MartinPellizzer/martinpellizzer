<p>Ceratophyllum submersum subsp.</p>
<p>muricatum, commonly known as the spiked water-chestnut, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in tiny spines.</p>
<p>The plant is submerged, forming thick mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
