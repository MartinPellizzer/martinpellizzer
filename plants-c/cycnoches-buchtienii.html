<p>Cycnoches buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white and green floral structure, with a unique, elongated spur that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding a rare and beautiful touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches buchtienii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
