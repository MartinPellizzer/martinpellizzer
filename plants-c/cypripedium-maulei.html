                    <h1>Cypripedium maulei</h1>
<p>Cypripedium maulei, commonly known as the Maule yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green floral structure, with a pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually solitary, with a short peduncle and showy sepals and petals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
