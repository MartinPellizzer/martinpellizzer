<p>Capparis nummularia, commonly known as the shieldflower or dwarf caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with small, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value.</p>
