                    <h1>Cuscuta megalantha</h1>
<p>Cuscuta megalantha, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly specialized structure for attaching to host plants, using haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and can be found on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
