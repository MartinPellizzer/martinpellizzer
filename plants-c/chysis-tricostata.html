<p>Chysis tricostata, commonly known as the three-costate cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves with a prominent central rib and three distinct costae, giving it its common name. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>The plant's slow growth and ancient lineage make it a valuable subject in botanical and evolutionary studies.</p>
