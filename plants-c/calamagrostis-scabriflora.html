<p>Calamagrostis scabriflora, commonly known as roughleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis scabriflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
