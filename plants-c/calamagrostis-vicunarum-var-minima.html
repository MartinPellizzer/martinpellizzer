                    <h1>Calamagrostis vicunarum var. minima</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis vicunarum var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf reed or lesser reed, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color. It is relatively low-growing, with a height ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in wetland gardens and conservation areas.</p>
