                    <h1>Cannabis erratica</h1>
<p>Cannabis erratica, commonly known as the wandering cannabis, is a rare and less-studied species within the Cannabis genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants, and exhibits a unique morphology compared to its more familiar relatives. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its fibrous root system and small, serrated leaves. Its flowers are dioecious, with males producing pollen sacs and females developing glandular trichomes that produce cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, Cannabis erratica remains a subject of interest for botanists and cannabis researchers.</p>
