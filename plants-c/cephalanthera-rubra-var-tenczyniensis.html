<p>Cephalanthera rubra var. tenczyniensis, commonly known as the Tenczynian red helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and green speckled flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, humusy soil. It has lance-shaped leaves and a single stem that bears several flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
