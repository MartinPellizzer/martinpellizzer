<p>Cenchrus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two distinct flower clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
