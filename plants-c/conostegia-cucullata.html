<p>Conostegia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it grows on the branches of various host trees. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
