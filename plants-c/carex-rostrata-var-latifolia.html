<p>Carex rostrata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps repel water, a feature common in wetland plants. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
