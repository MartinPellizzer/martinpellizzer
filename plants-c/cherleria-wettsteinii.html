                <h1>Cherleria wettsteinii</h1>
<p>Cherleria wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's cherleria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cherleria wettsteinii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
