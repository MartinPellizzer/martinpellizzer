                    <h1>Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. arenarius</h1>
<p>Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. arenarius, commonly known as the desert goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, yellowish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
