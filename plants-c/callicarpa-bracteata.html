<p>Callicarpa bracteata, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple to violet berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy berries.</p>
<p>The berries are not only ornamental but also edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans.</p>
