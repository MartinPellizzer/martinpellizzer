<p>Coffea myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved coffee.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive myrtle-like scent. It produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee.</p>
<p>Despite its potential, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
