                    <h1>Cardamine impatiens var. pectinata</h1>
<p>Cardamine impatiens var. pectinata, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shady environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broadly ovate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in wet soils and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Cardamine species, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
