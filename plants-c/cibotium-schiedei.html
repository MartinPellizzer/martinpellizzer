<p>Cibotium schiedei, commonly known as the Schied's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and storing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
