<p>Chlorospatha munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique green fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes Mountains in Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically a vibrant green, which contribute to its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable.</p>
