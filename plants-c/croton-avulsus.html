                    <h1>Croton avulsus</h1>
<p>Croton avulsus, commonly known as the Brazilian croton, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton avulsus is adapted to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem.</p>
