<p>Calochilus sandrae, commonly known as Sandra's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Calochilus sandrae is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation areas.</p>
