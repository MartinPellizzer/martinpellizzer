                    <h1>Conocephalus dubius</h1>
<p>Conocephalus dubius, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and forest floors. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
