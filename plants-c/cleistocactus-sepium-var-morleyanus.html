                    <h1>Cleistocactus sepium var. morleyanus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus sepium var. morleyanus, commonly known as the Morley's ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and conservation programs.</p>
