                    <h1>Citrus × insitorum</h1>
<p>Citrus × insitorum, commonly known as the trifoliate orange, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, yellow-orange fruits. The plant is often used as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. It is also valued in horticulture for its cold hardiness and ability to serve as a rootstock for other citrus varieties.</p>
<p>However, its fruits are generally not consumed due to their bitter taste and high acidity.</p>
