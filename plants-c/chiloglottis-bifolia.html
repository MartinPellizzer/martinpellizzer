                    <h1>Chiloglottis bifolia</h1>
<p>Chiloglottis bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved rock orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique two-leaf structure, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Chiloglottis. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for survival in nutrient-poor substrates and its role in the ecological diversity of Australian rainforests.</p>
