<p>Cyanothamnus quadrangulus, commonly known as the quadrangular bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with four-sided stems, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cyanothamnus quadrangulus is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
