                    <h1>Cistus viscosissimus</h1>
<p>Cistus viscosissimus, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its resinous properties make it resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its hardiness in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cistus viscosissimus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
