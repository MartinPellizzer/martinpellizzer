                    <h1>Cactus conicus</h1>
<p>Cactus conicus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny protrusions for protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus conicus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
