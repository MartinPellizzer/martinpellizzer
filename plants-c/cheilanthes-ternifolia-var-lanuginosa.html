                    <h1>Cheilanthes ternifolia var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes ternifolia var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly cliff brake, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliff faces or in crevices. Its fronds are typically dark green and develop spore-producing structures on their undersides.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptation to harsh, semi-arid conditions.</p>
