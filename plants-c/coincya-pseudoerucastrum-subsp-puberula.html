<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp.</p>
<p>puberula, commonly known as the pubescent water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the texture and pubescence of its foliage.</p>
