<p>Cyclosorus pararidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its branching, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the water, typically in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pararidus is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality.</p>
