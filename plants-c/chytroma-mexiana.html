<p>Chytroma mexiana, commonly known as the Mexican chytroma, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chytroma mexiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
