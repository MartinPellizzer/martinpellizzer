                    <h1>Celsia thasia</h1>
<p>Celsia thasia, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, rounded stem covered in dense, woolly hair that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Celsia thasia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
