<p>Crepis bakeri var. cusickii, commonly known as the Baker's hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse via wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
