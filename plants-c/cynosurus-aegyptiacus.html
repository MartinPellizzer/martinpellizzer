                    <h1>Cynosurus aegyptiacus</h1>
<p>Cynosurus aegyptiacus, commonly known as Egyptian couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
