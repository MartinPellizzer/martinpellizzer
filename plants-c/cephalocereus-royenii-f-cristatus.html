                    <h1>Cephalocereus royenii f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus royenii f. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique variant of the standard Cephalocereus royenii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crest-like growth pattern that forms a rosette of fleshy, spiny segments. This form results from a natural mutation known as "cristation," which causes the plant to grow in a fan-like shape rather than the typical upright structure. The plant is native to Mexico and thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>It produces yellow flowers in the evening, adding an ornamental value to its already striking appearance.</p>
