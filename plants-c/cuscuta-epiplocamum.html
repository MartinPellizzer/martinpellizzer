<p>Cuscuta epiplocamum, commonly known as the prickly dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
