                    <h1>Callitriche aquatica</h1>
<p>Callitriche aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early summer. It is an annual herb that spreads through rapid vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche aquatica plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
