<p>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
