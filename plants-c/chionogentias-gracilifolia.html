<p>Chionogentias gracilifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf snowblossom, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
