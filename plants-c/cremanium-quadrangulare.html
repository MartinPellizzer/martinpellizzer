                    <h1>Cremanium quadrangulare</h1>
<p>Cremanium quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-cornered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, four-angled stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its leaves are fleshy and alternate, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cremanium quadrangulare is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
