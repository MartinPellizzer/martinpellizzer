                    <h1>Cleome droserifolia</h1>
<p>Cleome droserifolia, commonly known as the sticky cleome, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, sticky hairs that help in capturing insects. Cleome droserifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and insect-trapping foliage make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
