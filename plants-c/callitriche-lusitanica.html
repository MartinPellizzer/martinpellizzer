<p>Callitriche lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions.</p>
<p>Callitriche lusitanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing water bodies and supporting aquatic life.</p>
