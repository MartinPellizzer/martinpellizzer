<p>Carex kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex kangdingensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
