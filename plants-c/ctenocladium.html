<p>Ctenocladium, commonly known as the golden ctenocladium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Ctenocladium species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, making them visually striking in gardens.</p>
