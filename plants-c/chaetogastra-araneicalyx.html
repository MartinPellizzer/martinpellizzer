                    <h1>Chaetogastra araneicalyx</h1>
<p>Chaetogastra araneicalyx, commonly known as the spider-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spider-like veins on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually pink or white, blooming during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many countries.</p>
