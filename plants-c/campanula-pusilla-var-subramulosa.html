The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover in alpine or rock garden settings.</p>
