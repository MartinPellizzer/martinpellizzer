                    <h1>Cuscuta decipiens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta decipiens, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination and attachment to a host via specialized haustoria. The plant is often found on crops like corn and soybeans, causing significant agricultural damage. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Cuscuta decipiens is native to various regions of the Americas and is considered an invasive species in many areas.</p>
