<p>Cleisostoma parishii, commonly known as the Parry's cleistostoma, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period is usually during the summer months, and it is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
