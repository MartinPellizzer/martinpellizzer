<p>Crepis bakeri subsp.</p>
<p>cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's crested grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and open fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators.</p>
