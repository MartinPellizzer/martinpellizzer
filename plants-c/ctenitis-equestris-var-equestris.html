The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually pinnately divided.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
