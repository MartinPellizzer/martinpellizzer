                    <h1>Cyclosorus dentatus var. violascens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus dentatus var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-veined water clover, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves with a distinctive violet-tinged venation.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich ponds and streams. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are usually submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
