<p>Cereus cinerascens, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many nocturnal flowering plants. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
