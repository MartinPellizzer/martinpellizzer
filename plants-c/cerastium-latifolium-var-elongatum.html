                    <h1>Cerastium latifolium var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Cerastium latifolium var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, with a distinctive elongated shape. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
