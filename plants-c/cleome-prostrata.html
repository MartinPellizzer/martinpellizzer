                    <h1>Cleome prostrata</h1>
<p>Cleome prostrata, commonly known as creeping cleome, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three, with five petals each. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Cleome prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
