The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, making it a notable species in the orchid family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Couthovia seemannii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
