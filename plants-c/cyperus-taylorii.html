<p>Cyperus taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often obscured by the dense foliage.
