<p>Crypsinus crassimarginatus, commonly known as the broad-margin crypton, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive broad margin that is often lighter in color than the central portion. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
