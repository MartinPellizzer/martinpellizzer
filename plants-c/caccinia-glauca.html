<p>Caccinia glauca, commonly known as the glaucous caccinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Caccinia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic features.</p>
