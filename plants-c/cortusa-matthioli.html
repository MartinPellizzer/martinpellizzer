<p>Cortusa matthioli, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
