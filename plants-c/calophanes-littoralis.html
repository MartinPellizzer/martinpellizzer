<p>Calophanes littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calophanes littoralis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
