<p>Calamus crassifolius, commonly known as broadleaf calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm-like plant characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of clustered, three-lobed fruits. Calamus crassifolius is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties.</p>
