<p>Cryptantha dumetorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
