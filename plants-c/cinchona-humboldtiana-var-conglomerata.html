<p>Cinchona humboldtiana var. conglomerata, commonly known as the Bolivian quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, and it is particularly noted for its high concentration of quinine, a compound used historically in the treatment of malaria.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal value and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
