<p>Cedrela salvadorensis, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical fruits containing smooth, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
