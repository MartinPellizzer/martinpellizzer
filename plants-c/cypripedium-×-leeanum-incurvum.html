                    <h1>Cypripedium × leeanum incurvum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × leeanum incurvum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
