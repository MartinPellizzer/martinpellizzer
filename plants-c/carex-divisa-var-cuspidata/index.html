                            <h1>Carex Divisa Var. Cuspidata</h1>
<p>Carex divisa var. cuspidata is a striking sedge species known for its unique foliage and adaptability to wetland environments. This variety features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often divided and tipped with sharp points, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is commonly found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its ability to tolerate standing water makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy flowering plants.</p>
