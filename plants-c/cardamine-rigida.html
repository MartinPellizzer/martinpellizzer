<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged in water, which helps in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Cardamine rigida is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
