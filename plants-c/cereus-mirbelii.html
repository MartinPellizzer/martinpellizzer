<p>Cereus mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cereeae tribe. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
