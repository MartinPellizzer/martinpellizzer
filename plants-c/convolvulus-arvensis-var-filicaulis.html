<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. filicaulis, commonly known as the slender field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, twining stems that often grow along the ground, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a tubular base, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed bank.</p>
