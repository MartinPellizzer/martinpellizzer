                    <h1>Carex × insolita</h1>
<p>Carex × insolita, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex morrowii, showcasing a mix of traits from both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often clustered in a panicle inflorescence.</p>
<p>Carex × insolita is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist to wet soil conditions.</p>
