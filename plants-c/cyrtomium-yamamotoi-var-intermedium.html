                    <h1>Cyrtomium yamamotoi var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium yamamotoi var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its small, spore-bearing sori are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
