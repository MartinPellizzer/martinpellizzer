                    <h1>Cephalocereus chrysacanthus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus chrysacanthus f. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Hedgehog Cactus, is a rare and striking variant of the species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, crest-like growth habit, which results from a mutation known as "cristata.". The plant features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, giving it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and requires careful care to thrive.</p>
