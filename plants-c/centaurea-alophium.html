<p>Centaurea alophium, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red or purple markings, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Centaurea alophium is often used in dry garden landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
