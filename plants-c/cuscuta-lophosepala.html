                    <h1>Cuscuta lophosepala</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lophosepala, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind or animals, allowing it to colonize a variety of host species. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is native to regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
