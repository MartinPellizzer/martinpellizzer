                    <h1>Cinnamomum mayanum</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum mayanum, commonly known as Mayan cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and reddish-brown bark, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries containing elliptical seeds. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and bark, contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinnamomum mayanum is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
