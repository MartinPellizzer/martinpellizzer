                    <h1>Corryocactus solitarius</h1>
<p>Corryocactus solitarius, commonly known as the solitary corryocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Corryocactus solitarius is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a unique addition to desert gardens.</p>
