<p>Carex laxiflora var. leptonervia, commonly known as the slender-veined sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, upright leaves with a distinctively veined structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
