<p>Critonia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure that resembles a spider. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small, colorful, and highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Critonia arachnoidea is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
