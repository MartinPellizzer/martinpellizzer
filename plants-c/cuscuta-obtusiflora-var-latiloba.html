                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. latiloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has a weak, serpentine stem that wraps around host plants, forming a tight connection for nutrient uptake. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as fields and along roadsides, where it can infest a variety of herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host, making it a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
