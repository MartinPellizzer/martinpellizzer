                    <h1>Carex riparia f. multifurcata</h1>
<p>Carex riparia f. multifurcata, commonly known as the forked sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its distinctive branching structure.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this form lies in its unique branching pattern, which differs from the typical growth form of the species.</p>
