                    <h1>Carya megacarpa</h1>
<p>Carya megacarpa, commonly known as the giant hickory, is a large deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit. The tree produces large, edible nuts encased in a thick, woody shell, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a distinct serrated edge.</p>
<p>The bark is deeply furrowed and becomes thick and ridged with age, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
