                    <h1>Castanea × fleetii</h1>
<p>Castanea × fleetii, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to China and has been widely cultivated in the United States for its edible nuts.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollis) and the Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata). The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and produces spiny, prickly husks that encase its edible nuts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its hardiness and resistance to chestnut blight, making it an important species in reforestation and agricultural efforts.</p>
