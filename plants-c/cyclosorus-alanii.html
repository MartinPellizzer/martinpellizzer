                    <h1>Cyclosorus alanii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus alanii, commonly known as the Alan's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclosorus alanii is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
