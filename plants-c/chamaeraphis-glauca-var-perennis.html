                    <h1>Chamaeraphis glauca var. perennis</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis glauca var. perennis, commonly known as sea barley or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for coastal habitats.</p>
