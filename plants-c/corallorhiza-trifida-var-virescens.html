                    <h1>Corallorhiza trifida var. virescens</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza trifida var. virescens, commonly known as the green-stem coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant.</p>
<p>It relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested areas where it can receive sufficient light for photosynthesis. Its stems are usually green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of the United States and is considered an indicator of mature, undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
