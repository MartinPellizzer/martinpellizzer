                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. rubrum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. rubrum, commonly known as the red-lip杓兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive red lip and a greenish-yellow upper sepal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as coniferous forests and alpine meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is known for its long blooming period in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
