                    <h1>Cheilanthes crassifolia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaf rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery, and often thickly hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
