                    <h1>Cristaria insularis</h1>
<p>Cristaria insularis, commonly known as the island starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped leaves and delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cristaria insularis is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
