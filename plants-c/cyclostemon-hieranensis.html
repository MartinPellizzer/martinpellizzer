                    <h1>Cyclostemon hieranensis</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon hieranensis, commonly known as the Jordanian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
