                    <h1>Calamagrostis polygama</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis polygama, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest in the landscape.</p>
