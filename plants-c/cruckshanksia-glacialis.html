                    <h1>Cruckshanksia glacialis</h1>
<p>Cruckshanksia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier cruckshanks, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cruckshankaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to extreme cold and low light conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Cruckshanksia glacialis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
