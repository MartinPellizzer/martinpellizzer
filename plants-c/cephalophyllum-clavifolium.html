<p>Cephalophyllum clavifolium, commonly known as the club-leaved candelabra, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>

The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
