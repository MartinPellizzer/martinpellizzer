                    <h1>Cochranea filifolia</h1>
<p>Cochranea filifolia, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite.</p>
