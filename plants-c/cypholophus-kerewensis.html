                    <h1>Cypholophus kerewensis</h1>
<p>Cypholophus kerewensis, commonly known as the Kerewean rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient uptake from the nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
