                    <h1>Campanula pseudocarpatica</h1>
<p>Campanula pseudocarpatica, commonly known as the false bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to other campanula species, though it is botanically distinct.</p>
