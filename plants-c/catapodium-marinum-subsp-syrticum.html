<p>Catapodium marinum subsp.</p>
<p>syrticum, commonly known as the desert grass or sand couch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal and desert environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
