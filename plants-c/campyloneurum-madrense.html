<p>Campyloneurum madrense, commonly known as the Madre√±o rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Campyloneurum madrense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
