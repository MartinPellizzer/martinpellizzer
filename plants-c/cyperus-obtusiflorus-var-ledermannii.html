<p>Cyperus obtusiflorus var. ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of tiny, pale green or brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus obtusiflorus.</p>
