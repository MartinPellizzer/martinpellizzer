<p>Cyclosorus florencei, commonly known as Florence's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountain streams of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with clear, fast-flowing water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
