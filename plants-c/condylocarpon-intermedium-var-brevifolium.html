                    <h1>Condylocarpon intermedium var. brevifolium</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon intermedium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has a gelatinous, blade-like structure that is typically attached to rocks or other substrates. The plant exhibits a simple thallus with a smooth, thin cell wall that allows it to thrive in intertidal zones. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water for dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical form of Condylocarpon intermedium.</p>
