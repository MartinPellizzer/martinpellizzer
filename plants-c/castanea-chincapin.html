                    <h1>Castanea chincapin</h1>
<p>Castanea chincapin, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and the production of spiny, burr-like fruits that encase one or two edible nuts. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which also includes oaks and beeches, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It was once a dominant species in the eastern United States but was nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to restore its population through breeding programs and disease resistance research.</p>
