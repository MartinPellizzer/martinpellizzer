                    <h1>Colpias</h1>
<p>Colpias, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly appendages, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the summer months. Colpias is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological rarity and its role in the conservation of wetland ecosystems.</p>
