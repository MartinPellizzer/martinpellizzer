                    <h1>Cottendorfia longipes</h1>
<p>Cottendorfia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cottendorfia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense cluster.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cottendorfia longipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
