<p>Cotyledon tuberculosa, commonly known as the pebble plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it popular as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
<p>Cotyledon tuberculosa is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to thrive.</p>
