                    <h1>Ctenopteris micropora</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris micropora, commonly known as the small-veined shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. Its leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in forest understories.</p>
