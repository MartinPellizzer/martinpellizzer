                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. platycarpa</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited marsh marigold, is a botanical variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near streams or in marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The fruit is distinctive for its broad, flat structure, which sets it apart from the typical capsule-like fruits of the species.</p>
