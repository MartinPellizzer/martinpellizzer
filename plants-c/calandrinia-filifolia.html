<p>Calandrinia filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf purslane, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a thread-like appearance, hence the common name.</p>
<p>Calandrinia filifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
