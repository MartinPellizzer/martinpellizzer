                    <h1>Cibotarium microcarpum</h1>
<p>Cibotarium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited cibotium, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
