<p>Calligonum taklimakanense, commonly known as the Taklamakan spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly the Taklamakan Desert.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, featuring small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
