<p>Conophytum pubescens, commonly known as the woolly conophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming a compact rosette shape. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Conophytum pubescens is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
