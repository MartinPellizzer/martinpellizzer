                    <h1>Calligonum arabicum</h1>
<p>Calligonum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enhancing its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum arabicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
