<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>dentata, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often translucent and finely divided.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive serrated or toothed edge, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
