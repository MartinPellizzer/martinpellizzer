                    <h1>Cyclandra</h1>
<p>Cyclandra, commonly known as the star-scaled or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. Cyclandra species are typically shrubs or small trees with distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers. They have a deep root system that allows them to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its unique, scaly bark and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
