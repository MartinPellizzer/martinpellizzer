                            <h1>Capsella Anglica</h1>
<p>Capsella anglica, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in gardens. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
