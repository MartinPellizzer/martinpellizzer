                    <h1>Carelia arbutifolia</h1>
<p>Carelia arbutifolia, commonly known as the common bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its persistent foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
