                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. strigosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. strigosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
