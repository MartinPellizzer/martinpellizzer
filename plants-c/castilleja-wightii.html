                    <h1>Castilleja wightii</h1>
<p>Castilleja wightii, commonly known as the Wight's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, spurred flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja wightii plays a role in pollination and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological significance.</p>
