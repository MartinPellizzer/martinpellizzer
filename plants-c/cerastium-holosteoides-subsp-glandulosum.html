<p>Cerastium holosteoides subsp.</p>
<p>glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, opposite, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowering period is brief, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance.</p>
