<p>Castellanoa marginata, commonly known as the coastal lantana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Castellanoa marginata is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
