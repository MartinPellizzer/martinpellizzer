<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful blooms that range from deep purples to vibrant yellows. The plant has aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
