                    <h1>Cephalanthus occidentalis var. brachypodus</h1>
<p>Cephalanthus occidentalis var. brachypodus, commonly known as the dwarf sweet pepper bush, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Cephalanthus occidentalis, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
