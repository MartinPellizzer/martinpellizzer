                    <h1>Cupressus atlantica</h1>
<p>Cupressus atlantica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and aromatic wood. The tree typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
