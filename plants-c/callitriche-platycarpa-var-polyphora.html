                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa var. polyphora</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. polyphora, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are adapted for water dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
