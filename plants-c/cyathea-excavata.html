                    <h1>Cyathea excavata</h1>
<p>Cyathea excavata, commonly known as the hollow tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique hollow stem, which gives it its common name and provides structural support. Cyathea excavata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
