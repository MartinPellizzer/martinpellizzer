                    <h1>Cyrtomium macrophyllum var. microindusium</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium macrophyllum var. microindusium, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form attractive, low-maintenance ground covers.</p>
<p>The varietal name "microindusium" refers to the small size of its indusia, which are the protective coverings over the sori.</p>
