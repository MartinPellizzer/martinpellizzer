                            <h1>Cleome Heterochroma</h1>
<p>Cleome heterochroma is a striking flowering plant known for its unique, fern-like leaves and vibrant, branching flowers. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is prized by gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers. Its distinctive appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to any garden landscape. Despite its beauty, Cleome heterochroma remains relatively underappreciated compared to more common garden plants.</p>
