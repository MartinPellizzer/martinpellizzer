<p>Nightshade trumpet, scientifically known as Cestrum bracteatum var. amictum, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. With its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, it captivates both botanists and gardeners alike. This plant is part of the nightshade family, which includes both ornamental and toxic species, making it a subject of both admiration and caution. Its unique appearance and exotic allure have made it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and tropical landscapes.
