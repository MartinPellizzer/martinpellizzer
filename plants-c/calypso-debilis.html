                    <h1>Calypso debilis</h1>
<p>Calypso debilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and highly protected.</p>
