<p>Calyptrogyne donnell-smithii, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark blue, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
