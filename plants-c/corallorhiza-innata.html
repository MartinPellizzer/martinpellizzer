                <h1>Corallorhiza innata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza innata, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces tall, slender stems with whorled, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
