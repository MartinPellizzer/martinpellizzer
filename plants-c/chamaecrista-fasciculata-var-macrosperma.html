<p>Chamaecrista fasciculata var. macrosperma, commonly known as the showy Crown Vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
