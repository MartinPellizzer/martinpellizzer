<p>Craibia laurentii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight-grained, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal.

It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Craibia laurentii is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
