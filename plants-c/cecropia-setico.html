<p>Cecropia setico, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds.
