                    <h1>Corispermum squarrosum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Corispermum squarrosum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a compact head. Its adaptations include thick cuticles and reduced leaf surfaces, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy soils and is considered a pioneer plant in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
