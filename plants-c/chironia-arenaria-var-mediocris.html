                    <h1>Chironia arenaria var. mediocris</h1>
<p>Chironia arenaria var. mediocris, commonly known as the beach sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in preventing erosion.</p>
