                    <h1>Citrus grandis var. brunneorugosa</h1>
<p>Citrus grandis var. brunneorugosa, commonly known as the rough-skinned citrus or rough lemon, is a variant of the citron tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often reddish-brown rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus species. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically small, with a bitter taste, and is primarily used for its aromatic peel rather than its juice.</p>
