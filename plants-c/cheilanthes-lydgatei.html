<p>Cheilanthes lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and compact, lanceolate fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes lydgatei is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
