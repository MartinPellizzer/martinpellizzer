                    <h1>Cuscuta americana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta americana, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through contaminated agricultural equipment. Dodder can infest a wide range of plants, including crops and ornamental species, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive on various hosts make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
