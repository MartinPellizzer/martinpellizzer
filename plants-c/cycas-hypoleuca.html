                    <h1>Cycas hypoleuca</h1>
<p>Cycas hypoleuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male cones being yellow and female cones green, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Cycas hypoleuca is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
