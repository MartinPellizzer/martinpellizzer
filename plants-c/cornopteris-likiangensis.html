                    <h1>Cornopteris likiangensis</h1>
<p>Cornopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help it absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cornopteris likiangensis is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
