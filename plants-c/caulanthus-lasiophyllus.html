                    <h1>Caulanthus lasiophyllus</h1>
<p>Caulanthus lasiophyllus, commonly known as the woolly silversword, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
