                    <h1>Cardamine resedifolia f. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Cardamine resedifolia f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and bright green coloration. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wet meadows and streambanks.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic insect populations.</p>
