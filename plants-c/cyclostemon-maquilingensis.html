                    <h1>Cyclostemon maquilingensis</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
