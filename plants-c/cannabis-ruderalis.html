                    <h1>Cannabis ruderalis</h1>
<p>Cannabis ruderalis, commonly known as the "wild cannabis," is a species native to Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its low THC content and high CBD levels, making it unique among cannabis species. This plant is particularly hardy, thriving in harsh environments and often growing in the wild without human cultivation. It typically has small, serrated leaves and produces spherical, resinous flowers.</p>
<p>Unlike other cannabis varieties, it does not rely on female plants for pollination, as it is predominantly self-pollinating.</p>
