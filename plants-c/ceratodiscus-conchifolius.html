                    <h1>Ceratodiscus conchifolius</h1>
<p>Ceratodiscus conchifolius, commonly known as the horned disk or sea hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates as a landscape plant.</p>
