                    <h1>Cinchona brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Cinchona brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by clustered red berries. It is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, though its use is less common than that of other cinchona species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
