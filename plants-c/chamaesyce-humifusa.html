<p>Chamaesyce humifusa, commonly known as the prostrate marshmallow, is a low-growing annual herb native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or oblong in shape, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters near the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms.</p>
