                    <h1>Chamaeangis letouzeyi</h1>
<p>Chamaeangis letouzeyi, commonly known as the Letouzey's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale, ghostly white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a compact, pseudobulb-like structure and possesses fibrous roots adapted to its moist, shaded habitat. It thrives in humid environments with high light levels, often growing on tree trunks or among dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
