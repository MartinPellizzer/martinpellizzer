                    <h1>Ctenitis baulensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis baulensis, commonly known as the Baul's ctenitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered along the veins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis baulensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
