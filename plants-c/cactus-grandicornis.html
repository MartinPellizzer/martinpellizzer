                    <h1>Cactus grandicornis</h1>
<p>Cactus grandicornis, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Cactus grandicornis exemplifies the unique botanical adaptations of desert flora.</p>
