<p>Clypeola maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty environment.</p>
<p>Clypeola maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
