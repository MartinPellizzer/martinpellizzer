                    <h1>Cachrys littoralis</h1>
<p>Cachrys littoralis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
