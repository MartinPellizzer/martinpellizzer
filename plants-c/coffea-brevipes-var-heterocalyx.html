                    <h1>Coffea brevipes var. heterocalyx</h1>
<p>Coffea brevipes var. heterocalyx, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size, with short stature and dense foliage, making it well-suited for shaded environments. The leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and dark green, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit, a red or yellow berry, contains two seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
