                    <h1>Cardiopteris lobata var. moluccana</h1>
<p>Cardiopteris lobata var. moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its shield-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical climates.</p>
