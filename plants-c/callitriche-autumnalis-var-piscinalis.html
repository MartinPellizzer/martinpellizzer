<p>Callitriche autumnalis var. piscinalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
