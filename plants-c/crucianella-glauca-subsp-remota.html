<p>Crucianella glauca subsp.</p>
<p>remota, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bladder-like and can inflate with air, a feature that aids in buoyancy and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a characteristic component of coastal flora.</p>
