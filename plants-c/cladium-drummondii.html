                    <h1>Cladium drummondii</h1>
<p>Cladium drummondii, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes, and it relies on wind pollination. Cladium drummondii plays an important ecological role in marsh ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes form dense mats that help prevent erosion in waterlogged areas.</p>
