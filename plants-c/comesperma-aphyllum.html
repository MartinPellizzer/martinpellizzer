<p>Comesperma aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant attaches to its host tree, typically a eucalypt, through a specialized structure called a haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Comesperma aphyllum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
