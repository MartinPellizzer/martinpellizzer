                            <h1>Corydalis Sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Corydalis sikkimensis is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Fumariaceae family and is known for its striking, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
