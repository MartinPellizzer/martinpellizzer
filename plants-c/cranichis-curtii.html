<p>Cranichis curtii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its small size and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
