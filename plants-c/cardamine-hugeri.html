<p>Cardamine hugeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or woodland soils. The plant is often found in stream banks and along the edges of ponds, where it can access the moisture it requires.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
