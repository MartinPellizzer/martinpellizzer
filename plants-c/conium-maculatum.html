                    <h1>Conium maculatum</h1>
<p>Conium maculatum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling.</p>
