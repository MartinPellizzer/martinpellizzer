                    <h1>Cynometra fischeri</h1>
<p>Cynometra fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is valued for both ecological and economic purposes.</p>
