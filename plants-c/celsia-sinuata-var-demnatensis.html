<p>Celsia sinuata var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's celsia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Celastraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and features small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and produce small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but under-researched species.</p>
