<p>Cystopus pectinifer, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose growth form, with a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Cystopus pectinifer is notable for its distinctive, feathery lobes that give it its common name.</p>
