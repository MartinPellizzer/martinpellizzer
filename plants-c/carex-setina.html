                    <h1>Carex setina</h1>
<p>Carex setina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than other sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Carex setina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
