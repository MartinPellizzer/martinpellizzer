<p>Cystidospermum, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cystidospermaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, bladder-like structures that aid in water retention, adapting them to arid environments. They typically have small, simple leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Cystidospermum species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
