                    <h1>Cyathea australis var. cervicalis</h1>
<p>Cyathea australis var. cervicalis, commonly known as the southern tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
