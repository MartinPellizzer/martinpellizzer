<p>Cleistoblechnum eburneum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often silver-veined fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is usually short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate, compound leaves.</p>
<p>The silver appearance of its fronds is due to the presence of fine, silvery hairs on the underside of the leaves.</p>
