<p>Conophytum restitutum, commonly known as the "Cape Tulip," is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, fleshy stem that is often covered in a layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Conophytum restitutum is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
