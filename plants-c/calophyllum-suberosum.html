<p>Calophyllum suberosum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by yellowish fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
