<p>Chasea dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among grass species.</p>
<p>Chasea dichotoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
