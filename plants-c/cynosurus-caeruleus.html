<p>Cynosurus caeruleus, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, pale blue to white flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cynosurus caeruleus is often found in association with other grasses and is an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
