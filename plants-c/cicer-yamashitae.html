<p>Cicer yamashitae, commonly known as the Yamashita cicer, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, velvety texture, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pale green or white.
