                    <h1>Corallorhiza grabhamii</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza grabhamii, commonly known as the Grabham's coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its dependence on these fungi and its limited habitat, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
