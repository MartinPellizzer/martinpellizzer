                    <h1>Couthovia sarcantha</h1>
<p>Couthovia sarcantha, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from deep within the soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Couthovia sarcantha is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
