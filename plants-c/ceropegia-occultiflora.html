<p>Ceropegia occultiflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its ability to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted for reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ceropegia occultiflora is also noted for its striking underground tubers, which can be harvested and used in traditional medicine.</p>
