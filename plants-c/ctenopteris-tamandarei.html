<p>Ctenopteris tamandarei, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris tamandarei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
