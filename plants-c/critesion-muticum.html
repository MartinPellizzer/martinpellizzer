<p>Critesion muticum, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles.</p>
