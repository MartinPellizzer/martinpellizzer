                    <h1>Coursetia tephrodes</h1>
<p>Coursetia tephrodes, commonly known as the desert shrub or sandbush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Coursetia tephrodes is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
