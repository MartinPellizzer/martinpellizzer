                    <h1>Cystopteris sudetica var. moupinensis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris sudetica var. moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern genus Cystopteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, streamside habitats. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its restricted distribution and is considered a relict species with historical significance in botanical studies.</p>
