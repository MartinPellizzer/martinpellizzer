                    <h1>Carex stricta var. humilis</h1>
<p>Carex stricta var. humilis, commonly known as dwarf bulblet sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, forming dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that emerge in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of moisture conditions.</p>
