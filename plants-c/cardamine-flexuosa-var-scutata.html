                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa var. scutata</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. scutata, commonly known as the scutate watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with alternate, trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive, scalloped edge. The small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring, followed by kidney-shaped, glossy seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar botanical traits such as the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its tissues.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of wooded areas where the soil remains consistently damp.</p>
