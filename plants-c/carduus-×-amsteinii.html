                    <h1>Carduus × amsteinii</h1>
<p>Carduus × amsteinii, commonly known as the Amstein's thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its growth habit is upright, with a height ranging from 1 to 2 meters, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its robust nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
