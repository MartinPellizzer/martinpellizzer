                    <h1>Chamaecladon humile</h1>
<p>Chamaecladon humile, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
