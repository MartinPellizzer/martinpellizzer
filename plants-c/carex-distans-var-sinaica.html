                    <h1>Carex distans var. sinaica</h1>
<p>Carex distans var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different morphology compared to the typical Carex distans.</p>
