<p>Ceraria gariepina, commonly known as the Cape dune lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in the arid environments of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is well adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including high temperatures and low moisture levels. Its growth form is usually crust-like, allowing it to adhere tightly to rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Ceraria gariepina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native habitat.</p>
