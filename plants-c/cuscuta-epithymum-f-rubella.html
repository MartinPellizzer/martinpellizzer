                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum f. rubella</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum f. rubella, commonly known as the red-stemd dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its reddish coloration, particularly in the stems and flowers, which distinguishes it from other dodder species. It typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination from seeds, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
