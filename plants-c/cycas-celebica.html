                    <h1>Cycas celebica</h1>
<p>Cycas celebica, commonly known as the Celebes cycad, is a unique species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas celebica thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
