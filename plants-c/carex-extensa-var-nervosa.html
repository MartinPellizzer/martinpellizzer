                    <h1>Carex extensa var. nervosa</h1>
<p>Carex extensa var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have distinct parallel veins. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
