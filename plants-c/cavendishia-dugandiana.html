                    <h1>Cavendishia dugandiana</h1>
<p>Cavendishia dugandiana, commonly known as the Dugand's cavendishia, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, creating a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
