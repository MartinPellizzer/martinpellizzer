                    <h1>Condylocarpon ciliatum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon ciliatum, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, soft, greenish-gray thallus with a finely textured surface. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
