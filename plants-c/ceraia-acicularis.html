                    <h1>Ceraia acicularis</h1>
<p>Ceraia acicularis, commonly known as the slender sea snail, is a species of sea snail in the family Littorinidae.</p>
<p>It is a small gastropod mollusk characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The species is found in marine environments, particularly in coastal areas with rocky substrates. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula.</p>
<p>The shell provides protection against predation and environmental stressors, making it an important feature of its survival strategy.</p>
