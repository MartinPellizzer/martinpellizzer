<p>Chamaesyce ocellata subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects in its native range.</p>
