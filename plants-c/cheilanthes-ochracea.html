<p>Cheilanthes ochracea, commonly known as the golden fringeless fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species well adapted to drought. The fronds are typically gray-green with a whitish or yellowish underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, resilient colonies.</p>
