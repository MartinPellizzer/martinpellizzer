                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata var. flavida</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata var. flavida, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces striking orange or yellow flowers, often with red or purple markings, which attract pollinators. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
