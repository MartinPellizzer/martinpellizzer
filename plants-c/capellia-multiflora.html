<p>Capellia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Capellia multiflora is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems have been traditionally used by local communities for making ropes and textiles.</p>
