                    <h1>Cyathea bisquamata</h1>
<p>Cyathea bisquamata, commonly known as the two-scale tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of bioluminescent bacteria. This unique trait makes it a striking and rare plant in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
