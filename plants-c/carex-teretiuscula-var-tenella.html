                    <h1>Carex teretiuscula var. tenella</h1>
<p>Carex teretiuscula var. tenella, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are usually borne on short, leafy stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
