<p>Crupina brachypappa, commonly known as coastal crupina, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread along coastal dunes and beaches.</p>
<p>Crupina brachypappa is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats.</p>
