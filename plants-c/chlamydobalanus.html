                    <h1>Chlamydobalanus</h1>
<p>Chlamydobalanus, commonly known as the encrusting barnacle, is a colonial marine bryozoan that forms dense, calcareous structures on submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Its colonies are typically encrusting, covering rocks, shells, and other substrates in coastal environments. The zooids are small and embedded within a calcareous matrix, with a distinctive tubular shape. It plays a significant role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics are closely tied to its calcified skeleton and colonial growth pattern.</p>
