<p>Crocodeilanthe velatipes, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are positioned on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
