<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus bewaniensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
