                    <h1>Cyrtogonium punctulatum</h1>
<p>Cyrtogonium punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Cyrtogonium punctulatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
