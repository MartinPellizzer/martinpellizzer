<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, flattened, and often ribbon-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Chordifex gracilior has a thalloid structure, meaning its body is not differentiated into true stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
