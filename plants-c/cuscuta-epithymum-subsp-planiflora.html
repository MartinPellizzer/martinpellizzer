<p>Cuscuta epithymum subsp.</p>
<p>planiflora, commonly known as the flat-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of host plants.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its flat, broad leaves, which are less lobed compared to other dodder species.</p>
