                    <h1>Ceratochloa sitchensis</h1>
<p>Ceratochloa sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy shorelines.</p>
