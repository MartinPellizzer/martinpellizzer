                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. eritraeana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. eritraeana, commonly known as the Eritrean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of Africa, including Eritrea and Sudan, and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found growing on crops such as millet and sorghum, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
