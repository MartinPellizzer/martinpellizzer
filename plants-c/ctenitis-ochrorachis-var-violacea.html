                    <h1>Ctenitis ochrorachis var. violacea</h1>
<p>Ctenitis ochrorachis var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-stemmed rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often tinged with a violet hue, particularly on the stems and undersides. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous or forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
