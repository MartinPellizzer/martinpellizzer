<p>Cladomyza cucullata, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The species is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to thrive in moist, marshy environments.</p>
