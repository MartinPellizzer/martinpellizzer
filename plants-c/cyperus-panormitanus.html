                    <h1>Cyperus panormitanus</h1>
<p>Cyperus panormitanus, commonly known as the Mediterranean flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, lake margins, and damp soils, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus panormitanus is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
