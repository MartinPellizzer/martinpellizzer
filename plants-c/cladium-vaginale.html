<p>Cladium vaginale, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often wrapped around the stems, forming a sheathing structure. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
<p>Cladium vaginale plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
