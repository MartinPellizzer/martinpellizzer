                    <h1>Cypripedium luteum var. concolor</h1>
<p>Cypripedium luteum var. concolor, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a prominent lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in association with coniferous trees. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
