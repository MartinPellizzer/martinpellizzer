                    <h1>Cerasus avium var. flava</h1>
<p>Cerasus avium var. flava, commonly known as the yellow cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow fruit, which ripens in late summer and is often used in culinary applications. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from the more common red or black cherries, particularly in its fruit color and seasonal bloom patterns.</p>
