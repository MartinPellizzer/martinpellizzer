                    <h1>Carumbium sebiferum</h1>
<p>Carumbium sebiferum, commonly known as the wax tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its bark contains a high concentration of wax, which has been historically used in candle-making and as a water-resistant coating.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in reclamation projects in desert areas.</p>
