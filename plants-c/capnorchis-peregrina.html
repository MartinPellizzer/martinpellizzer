                    <h1>Capnorchis peregrina</h1>
<p>Capnorchis peregrina, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in cloud forests where humidity is consistently high. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, well-drained soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnorchis peregrina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
