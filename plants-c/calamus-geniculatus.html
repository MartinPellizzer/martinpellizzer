                    <h1>Calamus geniculatus</h1>
<p>Calamus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Calamus geniculatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
