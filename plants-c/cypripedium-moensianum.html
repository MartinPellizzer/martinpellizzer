<p>Cypripedium moensianum, commonly known as the Moensian lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, twisted flower spike that bears numerous small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It has a distinctive rhizomatous root system and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
