                            <h1>Citronella Virescens</h1>
<p>Lemon grass, scientifically known as Citronella virescens, is a fragrant perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is widely recognized for its distinct lemon-like aroma and its versatile applications in cooking, traditional medicine, and natural pest control. The plant's stalks are commonly used to flavor dishes and beverages, while its essential oils are prized for their insect-repelling properties. Growing up to three feet tall, lemon grass thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its historical use dates back centuries, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal practices.</p>
