                    <h1>Coleotrype goudotii</h1>
<p>Coleotrype goudotii, commonly known as the golden star mushroom, is a species of fungus characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange cap and white gills.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is typically found in forested areas, particularly in association with decaying wood. The fruiting bodies are usually small, with a central bump or umbo on the cap surface. It is a saprophytic fungus, playing a role in decomposing organic matter in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other edible mushrooms, requiring careful identification to avoid confusion.</p>
