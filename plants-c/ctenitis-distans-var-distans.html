                    <h1>Ctenitis distans var. distans</h1>
<p>Ctenitis distans var. distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea holly, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, saline environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
