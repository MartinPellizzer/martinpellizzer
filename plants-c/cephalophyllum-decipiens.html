                    <h1>Cephalophyllum decipiens</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are adorned with distinctive, spiky red bracts resembling a crown or head. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on slender stems, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This species is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements in arid environments.</p>
