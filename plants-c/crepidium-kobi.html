<p>Crepidium kobi, commonly known as the Kobi orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with small, intricately shaped flowers that often display a mix of white and green hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche and the delicate balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Crepidium kobi is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
