                    <h1>Colutia</h1>
<p>Colutia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Colutia is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
