                    <h1>Cuscuta coryli</h1>
<p>Cuscuta coryli, commonly known as the hazelnut dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. The plant has a vine-like structure with yellow or orange stems that wrap around its host. It primarily parasitizes members of the Betulaceae family, including hazelnut trees.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host and then establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria.</p>
