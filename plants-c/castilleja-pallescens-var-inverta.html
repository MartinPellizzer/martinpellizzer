<p>Castilleja pallescens var. inverta, commonly known as the pallid milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has small, yellowish flowers and a root system that connects to the roots of neighboring plants, allowing it to obtain some of its nutrients. It is often found in association with other flowering plants and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can influence the growth and distribution of host species in its environment.</p>
