<p>Coccineorchis bracteosa, commonly known as the red orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often near streams or in wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
