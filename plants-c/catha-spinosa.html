<p>Catha spinosa, commonly known as khat, is a flowering shrub native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves contain psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use.</p>
<p>Due to its stimulating effects, Catha spinosa has been the subject of both cultural and regulatory scrutiny.</p>
