                    <h1>Cactus bulbispinus</h1>
<p>Cactus bulbispinus, commonly known as the white-tipped cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains.</p>
<p>The cactus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and dry scrublands.</p>
