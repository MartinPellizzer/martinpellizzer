                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. stellatus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. stellatus, commonly known as the stellate Bermuda grass, is a variant of the widely distributed Bermuda grass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive stellate (star-shaped) inflorescences, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical grasses. This plant is a perennial grass that thrives in warm climates and is often found in lawns, sports fields, and disturbed soils. It has a dense, creeping growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that help it spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a valuable turfgrass and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
