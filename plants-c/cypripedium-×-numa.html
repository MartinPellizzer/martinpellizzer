                    <h1>Cypripedium × numa</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × numa, commonly known as the Numatang Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, pouch-like labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium × numa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
