                    <h1>Crucianella sorgerae</h1>
<p>Crucianella sorgerae, commonly known as the Sorg√©'s sea bean, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped, indehiscent fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas subject to tidal influence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
