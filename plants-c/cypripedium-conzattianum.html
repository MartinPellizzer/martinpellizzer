<p>Cypripedium conzattianum, commonly known as the Conzatti's杓兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow lip and a dark purple or brown upper lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
