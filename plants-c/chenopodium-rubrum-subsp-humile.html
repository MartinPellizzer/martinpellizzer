<p>Chenopodium rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>humile, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic plants.</p>
