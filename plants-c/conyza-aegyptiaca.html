                    <h1>Conyza aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Conyza aegyptiaca, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa but now widely distributed across temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dandelion-like yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas.</p>
