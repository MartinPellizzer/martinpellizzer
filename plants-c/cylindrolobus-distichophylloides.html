                    <h1>Cylindrolobus distichophylloides</h1>
<p>Cylindrolobus distichophylloides, commonly known as the two-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, cylindrical stems and two-ranked, linear leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
