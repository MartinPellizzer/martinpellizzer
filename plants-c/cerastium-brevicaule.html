                    <h1>Cerastium brevicaule</h1>
<p>Cerastium brevicaule, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields.</p>
