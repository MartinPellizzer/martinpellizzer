                    <h1>Clematis lathyrifolia</h1>
<p>Clematis lathyrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets that are usually narrow and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it requires support to climb.</p>
<p>Clematis lathyrifolia is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote flowering.</p>
