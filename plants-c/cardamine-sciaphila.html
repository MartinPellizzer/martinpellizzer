                    <h1>Cardamine sciaphila</h1>
<p>Cardamine sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving water crowfoot, is a delicate herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, palmately divided leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in woodland floors and stream banks, where it benefits from high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific microhabitats, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
