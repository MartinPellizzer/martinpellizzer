                    <h1>Cytinus andrieuxii</h1>
<p>Cytinus andrieuxii, commonly known as the Egyptian hen of the woods, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the family Cytinaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, reddish-orange stems and a single, large, umbrella-like flower that blooms in the spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a modified stem that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a means of attachment to its host. It is primarily found in arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it grows on the roots of leguminous plants.</p>
<p>Its unusual morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
