                    <h1>Cyanella metallica</h1>
<p>Cyanella metallica, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, although it is often mistaken for a member of the Cyperaceae family due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, sandy soils in coastal areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Cyanella metallica is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in maritime environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for coastal ecosystems.</p>
