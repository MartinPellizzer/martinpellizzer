<p>Cynosurus elegans var. obliquatus, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
