<p>Castilleja applegatei var. applegatei, commonly known as Applegate's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are modified leaves that attract pollinators. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its native environment.</p>
