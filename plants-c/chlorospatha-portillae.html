                    <h1>Chlorospatha portillae</h1>
<p>Chlorospatha portillae, commonly known as the golden-leaf fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright green fronds that shimmer under sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, fibrous rhizome that supports its delicate, feather-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Chlorospatha portillae is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
