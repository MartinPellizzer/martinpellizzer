<p>Cerastium carinthiacum subsp.</p>
<p>austroalpinum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically reaches a height of 5â€“15 cm and features small, basal leaves that are rounded and hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundras.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
