<p>Carex glauca var. rotundata, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that exhibits a striking blue-green hue due to the presence of a waxy cuticle.

It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
