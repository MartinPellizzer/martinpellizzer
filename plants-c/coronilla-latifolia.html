                    <h1>Coronilla latifolia</h1>
<p>Coronilla latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with 10â€“20 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant forms dense mats through its extensive root system, making it a common invasive species in some regions. It has a deep taproot that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts.</p>
