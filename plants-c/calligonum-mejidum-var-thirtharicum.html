<p>Calligonum mejidum var. thirtharicum, commonly known as the Thirtharicum saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in saline soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important species for stabilizing sandy or degraded landscapes.</p>
