                    <h1>Cladium maingayi var. subsetosum</h1>
<p>Cladium maingayi var. subsetosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland ecosystems in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, aiding in water retention. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptation to fluctuating water levels and its role in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
