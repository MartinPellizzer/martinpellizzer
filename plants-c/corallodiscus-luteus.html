<p>It is characterized by its calcified, disc-like thallus that forms a dense, crust-like structure on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a yellowish to orange coloration due to the presence of pigments such as fucoxanthin. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>Corallodiscus luteus plays a role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the structural complexity of marine habitats.</p>
