<p>Cymbilabia undulata, commonly known as the undulating cymbal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, undulating petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and come in a range of colors including white, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cymbilabia undulata is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas.</p>
