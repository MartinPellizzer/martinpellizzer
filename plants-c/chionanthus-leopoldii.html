<p>Chionanthus leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's fringe flower, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
