                    <h1>Cactus intortus</h1>
<p>Cactus intortus, commonly known as the twisted cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiraling, twisted stems that resemble the shape of a helix, providing structural support and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, spiny flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus intortus is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures.</p>
