                    <h1>Corynophallus mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Corynophallus mossambicensis, commonly known as the "Sword Moss" or "Cape Moss," is a unique moss species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are often curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This moss is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions due to its thick, water-retaining leaf structure.</p>
