<p>medogensis, commonly known as the Medog cypress, is a rare and relict species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
