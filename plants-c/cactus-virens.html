                    <h1>Cactus virens</h1>
<p>Cactus virens, commonly known as the green cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus virens plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
