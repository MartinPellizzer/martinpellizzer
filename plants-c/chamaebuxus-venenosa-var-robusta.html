                    <h1>Chamaebuxus venenosa var. robusta</h1>
<p>Chamaebuxus venenosa var. robusta, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host, often causing stress or damage to the host tree.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
