                    <h1>Criosanthes arietina</h1>
<p>Criosanthes arietina, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adapting to the cold and short growing season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme climates and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility, it is highly susceptible to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
