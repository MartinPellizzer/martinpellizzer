                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy coffee plant, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Arabica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from the more common smooth-leaved varieties. This plant is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it grows in cool, shaded environments. It produces small, red berries containing seeds that can be processed into coffee.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and coffee enthusiasts alike.</p>
