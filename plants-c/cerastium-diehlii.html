                    <h1>Cerastium diehlii</h1>
<p>Cerastium diehlii, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Cerastium diehlii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
