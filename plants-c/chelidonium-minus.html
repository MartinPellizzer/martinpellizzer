                    <h1>Chelidonium minus</h1>
<p>Chelidonium minus, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Its leaves are broadly oval with a waxy surface, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
