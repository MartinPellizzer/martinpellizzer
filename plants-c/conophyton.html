                    <h1>Conophyton</h1>
<p>Conophyton, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are often low-growing and can form dense mats, which help reduce soil erosion.</p>
<p>Conophyton is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
