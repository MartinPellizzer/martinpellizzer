                    <h1>Cheilanthes viridis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viridis, commonly known as the green rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. This plant thrives in rocky or crevice habitats, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely in crevices.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
