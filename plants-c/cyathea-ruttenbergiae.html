<p>Cyathea ruttenbergiae, commonly known as the Ruttenberg's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the upright growth of the trunk.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores.</p>
