<p>Cakile arctica, commonly known as Arctic knotweed, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Cakile arctica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
