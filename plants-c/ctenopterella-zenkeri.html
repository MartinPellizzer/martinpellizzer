<p>Ctenopterella zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's feather fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting its growth.</p>
<p>Ctenopterella zenkeri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
