<p>Cyclophorus rasamalae f. minor, commonly known as the minor form of the Rasamala cyclophorus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinctive cycloid pattern that aids in water retention in its arid habitat. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. It produces tiny, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
