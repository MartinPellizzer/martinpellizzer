<p>Cactus densus, commonly known as the dense cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape with spines that protect it from herbivores. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are often bright yellow or orange and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
