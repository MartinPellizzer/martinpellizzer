<p>Carex arenaria var. repens, commonly known as sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of sandy soils and a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
