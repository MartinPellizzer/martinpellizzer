                    <h1>Cirsium arvense var. incanum</h1>
<p>Cirsium arvense var. incanum, commonly known as yellow cockle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its root system is extensive and fibrous. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Yellow cockle is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
