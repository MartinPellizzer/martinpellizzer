<p>Cytisus frutescens, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
