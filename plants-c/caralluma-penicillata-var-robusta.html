                    <h1>Caralluma penicillata var. robusta</h1>
<p>Caralluma penicillata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust candleplant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
