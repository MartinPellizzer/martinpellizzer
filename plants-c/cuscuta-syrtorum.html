                    <h1>Cuscuta syrtorum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta syrtorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to species like grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, allowing it to spread quickly in suitable environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or mechanical means, contributing to its invasive potential in new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
