                    <h1>Cotoneaster frigidus f. aldenhamensis</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster frigidus f. aldenhamensis, commonly known as the Aldenham cotoneaster, is a rare and frost-tolerant shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of conservation interest.</p>
