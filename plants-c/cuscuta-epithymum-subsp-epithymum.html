<p>Cuscuta epithymum subsp.</p>
<p>epithymum, commonly known as the yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
