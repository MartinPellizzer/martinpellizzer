                    <h1>Cedrela longifolia var. kumaona</h1>
<p>Cedrela longifolia var. kumaona, commonly known as Kumaona or Hawaiian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and long, slender leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and historical overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
