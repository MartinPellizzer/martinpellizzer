                    <h1>Cycas bifida</h1>
<p>Cycas bifida, commonly known as the bifid cycad, is a species of cycad native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas bifida is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
