<p>Ctenodon acapulcensis, commonly known as the Acapulco fern, is a unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenodon acapulcensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
