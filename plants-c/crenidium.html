                    <h1>Crenidium</h1>
<p>Crenidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers and lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the trunks of cypress trees. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Crenidium is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
