<p>Conradia sloanei, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky areas and is a symbol of the desert landscape.</p>
