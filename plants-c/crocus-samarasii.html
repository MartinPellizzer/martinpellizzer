<p>Crocus samarasii, commonly known as the Samarasii crocus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and has a short, underground bulb that stores nutrients. It blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering crocuses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
