                    <h1>Cyclosorus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. This liverwort typically grows on the stems or leaves of other plants, often in moist, shaded environments. Its structure consists of a thallus with a dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a complex system of rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
