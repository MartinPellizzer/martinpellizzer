                    <h1>Cypripedium roezlii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium roezlii, commonly known as the RÃ¶sel's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with broad, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium roezlii is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
