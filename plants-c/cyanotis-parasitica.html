                    <h1>Cyanotis parasitica</h1>
<p>Cyanotis parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic bluebell, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be found in association with various host species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
