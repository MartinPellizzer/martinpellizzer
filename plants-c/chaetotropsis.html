                    <h1>Chaetotropsis</h1>
<p>Chaetotropsis, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in their nutrient acquisition. Chaetotropsis species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Their leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient gas exchange in water.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its carnivorous nature, which is a unique adaptation among aquatic plants.</p>
