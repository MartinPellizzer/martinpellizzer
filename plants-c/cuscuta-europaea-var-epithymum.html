                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. epithymum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. epithymum, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, often found on crops such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
