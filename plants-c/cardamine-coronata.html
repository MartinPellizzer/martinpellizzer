                    <h1>Cardamine coronata</h1>
<p>Cardamine coronata, commonly known as crowned watercress, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a raceme, often with a crown-like appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its distribution in temperate regions.</p>
