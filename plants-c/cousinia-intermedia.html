<p>Cousinia intermedia, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
