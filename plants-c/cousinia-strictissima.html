<p>Cousinia strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia strictissima is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
