<p>Cissus nervosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical climbing plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Cissus nervosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
