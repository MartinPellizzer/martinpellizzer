                    <h1>Conocarpus novae-zeylandiae</h1>
<p>Conocarpus novae-zeylandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand mangrove, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to coastal areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and tidal environments, with a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
