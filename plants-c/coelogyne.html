                    <h1>Coelogyne</h1>
<p>Coelogyne, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Coelogyne, is a group of about 150 species native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. They are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that often bloom in clusters and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red. Coelogyne orchids have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
