                    <h1>Cynanchum pendulum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing toxic, sticky seeds. Cynanchum pendulum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
<p>However, it contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially poisonous to humans and livestock.</p>
