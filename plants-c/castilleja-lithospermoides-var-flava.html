                    <h1>Castilleja lithospermoides var. flava</h1>
<p>Castilleja lithospermoides var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and forms associations with other plants in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
