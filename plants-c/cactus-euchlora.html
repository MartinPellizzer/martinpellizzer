                    <h1>Cactus euchlora</h1>
<p>Cactus euchlora, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features spiny stems and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals.</p>
