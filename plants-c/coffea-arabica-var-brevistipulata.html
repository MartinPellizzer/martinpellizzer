<p>Coffea arabica var. brevistipulata, commonly known as the short-stippled coffee plant, is a variant of the widely cultivated Arabica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive short, narrow leaf tips, which differentiate it from other Coffea arabica varieties. This plant typically grows in tropical highland regions, thriving in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>While primarily grown for its aromatic beans, it also holds significance in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits.</p>
