<p>Cephalanthera epipactoides, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
