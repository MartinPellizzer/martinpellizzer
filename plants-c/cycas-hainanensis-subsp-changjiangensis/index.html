                            <h1>Cycas Hainanensis Subsp. Changjiangensis</h1>
<p>Hainan cycas, scientifically known as Cycas hainanensis subsp. changjiangensis, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical island of Hainan in China. This cycad species is part of a group of plants that have existed for over 280 million years, surviving through major geological and climatic changes. It is characterized by its stout trunk, large pinnate leaves, and unique reproductive structures called cones. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this living fossil and its ecological role in Hainan's biodiversity.</p>
