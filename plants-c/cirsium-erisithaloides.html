<p>Cirsium erisithaloides, commonly known as the eristaloid thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species.</p>
