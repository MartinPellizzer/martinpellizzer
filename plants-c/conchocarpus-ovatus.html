                    <h1>Conchocarpus ovatus</h1>
<p>Conchocarpus ovatus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange berries. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conchocarpus ovatus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal shores and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
