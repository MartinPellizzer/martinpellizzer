                    <h1>Callisace</h1>
<p>Callisace, commonly known as the sandmat family, is a small group of flowering plants primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and often have a compact, low-growing habit. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually white or pale in color. They are adapted to survive in dry environments through various mechanisms such as reduced leaf surface and deep root systems.</p>
<p>Callisace species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
