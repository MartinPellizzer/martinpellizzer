                    <h1>Carex perennis</h1>
<p>Carex perennis, commonly known as blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Carex perennis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems.</p>
