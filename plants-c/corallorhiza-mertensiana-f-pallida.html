                    <h1>Corallorhiza mertensiana f. pallida</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza mertensiana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which are essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
