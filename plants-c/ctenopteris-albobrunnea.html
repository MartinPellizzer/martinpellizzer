                    <h1>Ctenopteris albobrunnea</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris albobrunnea, commonly known as the white-streaked sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a pale, almost white, midrib and dark green margins. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is adapted to withstand regular exposure to saltwater and tidal action. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, anchoring it in sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically narrow and strap-like, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
