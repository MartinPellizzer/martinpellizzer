<p>Caladenia longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>minima, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, elongated floral spike with a single, delicate orchid flower. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider, hence its common name.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
