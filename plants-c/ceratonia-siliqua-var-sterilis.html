                    <h1>Ceratonia siliqua var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Ceratonia siliqua var. sterilis, commonly known as the desert bean or tamarind tree, is a variant of the carob tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and produces long, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow and are followed by the characteristic brown, woody pods.</p>
<p>While the fruit is edible, the variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh climates.</p>
