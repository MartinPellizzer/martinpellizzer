                    <h1>Chlorogalum</h1>
<p>Chlorogalum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Chlorogalum species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The name "candleplant" refers to the candle-like shape of its flower stalk.</p>
