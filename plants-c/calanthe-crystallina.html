                    <h1>Calanthe crystallina</h1>
<p>Calanthe crystallina, commonly known as the crystal calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent white petals and sepals that resemble crystal, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the species is noted for its unique, intricate floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe crystallina is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
