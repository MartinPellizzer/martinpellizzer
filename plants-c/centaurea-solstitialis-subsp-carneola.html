<p>Centaurea solstitialis subsp.</p>
<p>carneola, commonly known as the redstem goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright red or orange bracts that surround its small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems.</p>
