<p>Crepidospermum prancei, commonly known as the Prance's spiderling, is a climbing vine native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
