                    <h1>Cheilosoria patula</h1>
<p>Cheilosoria patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>Cheilosoria patula plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
