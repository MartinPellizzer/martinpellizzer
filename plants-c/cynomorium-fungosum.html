<p>Cynomorium fungosum, commonly known as the desert cucumber, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
