                    <h1>Corunastylis cuspidata</h1>
<p>Corunastylis cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Corunastylis cuspidata is often found in swampy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
