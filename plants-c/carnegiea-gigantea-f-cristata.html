                    <h1>Carnegiea gigantea f. cristata</h1>
<p>Carnegiea gigantea f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate saguaro, is a unique variant of the saguaro cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a distinctive, branched growth form due to a natural mutation called "cristation," which results in a fan-like structure. The cristate form is less common than the typical straight trunk of the saguaro and is often considered a botanical curiosity. It retains the typical features of the species, including its spines and flowering capabilities.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a similar ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
