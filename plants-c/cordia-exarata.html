                    <h1>Cordia exarata</h1>
<p>Cordia exarata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cordia exarata plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
