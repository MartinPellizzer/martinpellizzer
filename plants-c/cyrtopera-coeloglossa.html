                <h1>Cyrtopera coeloglossa</h1>
<p>Cyrtopera coeloglossa, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
