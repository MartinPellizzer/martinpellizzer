<p>Calyptrochilum bokoyense, commonly known as the Bokoye orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized labellum that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are small but striking, often displaying vivid colors and intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptrochilum bokoyense is considered a conservation concern.</p>
