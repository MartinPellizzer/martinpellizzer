                    <h1>Coronopus pinnatus</h1>
<p>Coronopus pinnatus, commonly known as the featherleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Coronopus pinnatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
