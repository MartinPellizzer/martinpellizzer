                    <h1>Callitris rhomboidea var. tasmanica</h1>
<p>Callitris rhomboidea var. tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian cypress, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the Callitris genus, which are found primarily in Australia and New Guinea.</p>
