<p>Mexican sunflower, scientifically known as Chrozophora plicata var. rottleri, is a strikingly colorful plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is prized for its vibrant orange to red blooms that resemble the sun, giving it its common name. This annual plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking bold visual impact. Its unique foliage, with deeply lobed leaves, adds texture and interest to any landscape. Despite its ornamental appeal, it also serves as a valuable nectar source for butterflies and other pollinators.</p>
