                    <h1>Cyperus diffusus var. chorisanthus</h1>
<p>Cyperus diffusus var. chorisanthus, commonly known as the golden bulb sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, often arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential weed in agricultural areas.</p>
