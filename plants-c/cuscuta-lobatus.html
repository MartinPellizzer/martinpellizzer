                    <h1>Cuscuta lobatus</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lobatus, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new hosts. It is often found growing on crops and wild plants, causing damage by weakening its host.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it an important consideration in agricultural settings.</p>
