                    <h1>Cyathea hirsuta</h1>
<p>Cyathea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, with a pinnate structure. Cyathea hirsuta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
