<p>Carlina frigida subsp.</p>
<p>fiumensis, commonly known as the alpine carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in dense white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cold, rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
