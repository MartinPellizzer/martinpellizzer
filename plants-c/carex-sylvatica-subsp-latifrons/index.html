                            <h1>Carex Sylvatica Subsp. Latifrons</h1>
<p>Broad-fruited sedge, scientifically known as Carex sylvatica subsp. latifrons, is a striking member of the sedge family that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This subspecies is distinguished by its broad, strap-like leaves and clusters of pale to brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. Despite its modest appearance, the broad-fruited sedge plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.</p>
