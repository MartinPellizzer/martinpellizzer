                    <h1>Chromolaena heteroclinia</h1>
<p>Chromolaena heteroclinia, commonly known as the spreading crofton weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is an aggressive invasive species that can rapidly colonize disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it is considered a significant ecological threat in many regions.</p>
