                    <h1>Chaerophyllum × loretii</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum × loretii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Chaerophyllum temulentum and Chaerophyllum palustre.</p>
