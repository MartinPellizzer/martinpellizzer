                    <h1>Capnorea hirtella</h1>
<p>Capnorea hirtella, commonly known as the hairy capnorea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Capnorea hirtella typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
