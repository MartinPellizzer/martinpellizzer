                    <h1>Centaurella autumnalis</h1>
<p>Centaurella autumnalis, commonly known as autumn centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces achene fruits, which are dry, indehiscent seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Centaurella autumnalis thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and coastal areas.</p>
