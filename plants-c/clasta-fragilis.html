                    <h1>Clasta fragilis</h1>
<p>Clasta fragilis, commonly known as the brittle clasta, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, easily breakable stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming a low, sprawling shrub that helps it retain moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often overlooked, but they play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
