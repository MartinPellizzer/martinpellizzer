                    <h1>Cohniella sprucei</h1>
<p>Cohniella sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's cohniella, is a rare and specialized plant species.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with small, needle-like leaves adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cohniella sprucei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
