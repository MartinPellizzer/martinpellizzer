                    <h1>Cyclosorus subalpinus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine cyclosorus, is a rare and specialized fern species native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cyclosorus subalpinus is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
