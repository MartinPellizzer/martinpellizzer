                    <h1>Callianthe fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Callianthe fluviatilis, commonly known as the river lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, unpolluted water ecosystems.</p>
