<p>Cistanche stenostachya, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid regions of Asia, including China, India, and parts of the Middle East. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a unique structure with a tubular stem that attaches to its host. It is often found growing on species of Ephedra, and its roots penetrate the host's tissues to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
