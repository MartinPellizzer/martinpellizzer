<p>Chaetothylax huilensis, commonly known as the Huiltepec orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its intricate, hairy structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, and it blooms during the spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chaetothylax huilensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche.</p>
