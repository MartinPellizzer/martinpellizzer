                    <h1>Cassytha peninsularis</h1>
<p>Cassytha peninsularis, commonly known as the slender cassytha, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its twining stems that wrap around host plants for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, reducing the plant's need for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Cassytha peninsularis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
