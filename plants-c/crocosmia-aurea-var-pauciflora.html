                    <h1>Crocosmia aurea var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Crocosmia aurea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of orange-red to red flowers, which are tubular and appear in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color.</p>
<p>This variety is less floriferous than the typical Crocosmia aurea, making it a more subtle addition to gardens.</p>
