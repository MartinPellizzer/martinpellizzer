                    <h1>Cattleya × hummeliana</h1>
<p>Cattleya × hummeliana, commonly known as the Hummel's cattleya, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya labiata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, with a distinct dark blotch on the lip. The plant produces thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves, which help it store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular among growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
