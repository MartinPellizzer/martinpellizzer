                    <h1>Castilleja payneae</h1>
<p>Castilleja payneae, commonly known as Payne's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like sagebrush steppe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
