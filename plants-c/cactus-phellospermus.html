                    <h1>Cactus phellospermus</h1>
<p>Cactus phellospermus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
