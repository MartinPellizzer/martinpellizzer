<p>Cucumis melo var. vaughans-original-osage, commonly known as the Osage orange, is a variant of the cucumber family plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States and is characterized by its thick, yellow-orange fruit with a rough, bumpy skin. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences or in hedgerows. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit, while not typically eaten due to its bitter taste, has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a natural barrier due to its thorny exterior.</p>
