                    <h1>Cleistocactus hildegardiae</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus hildegardiae, commonly known as the Hildegard's closed-cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
