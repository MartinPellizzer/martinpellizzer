                    <h1>Cranichis crenatifolia</h1>
<p>Cranichis crenatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
