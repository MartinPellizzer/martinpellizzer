                    <h1>Carex altaica</h1>
<p>Carex altaica, commonly known as the high alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky areas.</p>
<p>Carex altaica is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
