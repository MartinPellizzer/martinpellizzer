<p>Corispermum leptopterum var. squarrosum, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth coat, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
