<p>Calamus polygamus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Calamus polygamus is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
