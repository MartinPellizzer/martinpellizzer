                    <h1>Carduus argentatus</h1>
<p>Carduus argentatus, commonly known as the silver thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy leaves and spiny, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The silver thistle is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating skin conditions and as a diuretic.</p>
