                    <h1>Cassiope membranifolia</h1>
<p>Cassiope membranifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
