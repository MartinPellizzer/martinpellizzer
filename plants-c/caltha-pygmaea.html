                    <h1>Caltha pygmaea</h1>
<p>Caltha pygmaea, commonly known as lesser marsh marigold, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by several sepals that are mistaken for petals.</p>
<p>Caltha pygmaea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
