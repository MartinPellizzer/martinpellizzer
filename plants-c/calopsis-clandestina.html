                    <h1>Calopsis clandestina</h1>
<p>Calopsis clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant's epiphytic nature allows it to attach to tree bark, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Calopsis clandestina thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
