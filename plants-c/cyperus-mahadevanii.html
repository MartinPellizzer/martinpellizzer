<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedge plants characterized by their triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as rice fields and wetlands, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant, making it monoecious.</p>
<p>Cyperus mahadevanii is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils.</p>
