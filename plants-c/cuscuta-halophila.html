                    <h1>Cuscuta halophila</h1>
<p>Cuscuta halophila, commonly known as the saltbush dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</p>
