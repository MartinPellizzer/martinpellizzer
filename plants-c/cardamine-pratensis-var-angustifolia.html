                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, spear-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for various herbivores.</p>
