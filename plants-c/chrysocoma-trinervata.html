                    <h1>Chrysocoma trinervata</h1>
<p>Chrysocoma trinervata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that exudes a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by clusters of round, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.</p>
