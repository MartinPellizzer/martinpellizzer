                    <h1>Calamagrostis gracilis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis gracilis, commonly known as slender sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy areas of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white along the edges. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use by Indigenous peoples in crafting and ceremonial practices.</p>
