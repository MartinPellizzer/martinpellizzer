                    <h1>Ctenopteris</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, feathery leaves that resemble the bristles of a comb, hence the genus name derived from the Greek words for "comb" and "leaf.". Ctenopteris species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, a feature common in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage.</p>
