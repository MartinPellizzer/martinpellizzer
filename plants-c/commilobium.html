<p>Commilobium, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale flowers. Commilobium species are generally perennial herbs that exhibit a low-growing, cushion-like growth form.</p>
