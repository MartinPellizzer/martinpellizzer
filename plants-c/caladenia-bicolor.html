                    <h1>Caladenia bicolor</h1>
<p>Caladenia bicolor, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family found primarily in southern Australia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are characterized by their vivid pink color and a distinctive, elongated labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant produces a single spike with several flowers, each featuring three sepals and three petals, with the labellum being the most prominent feature.</p>
<p>Caladenia bicolor is a short-lived species, with its life cycle often spanning several years, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction.</p>
