<p>Calamagrostis distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are spaced apart, giving it its characteristic "distant-flowered" appearance.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis distantiflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
