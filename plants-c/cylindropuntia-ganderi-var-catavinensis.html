                    <h1>Cylindropuntia ganderi var. catavinensis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia ganderi var. catavinensis, commonly known as the Catavinensis cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise spiky structure. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
