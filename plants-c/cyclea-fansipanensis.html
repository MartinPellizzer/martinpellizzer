<p>Cyclea fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan cycad, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
