                    <h1>Caragana jubata var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Caragana jubata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf shrub or pygmy caragana, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental purposes in arid gardens.</p>
