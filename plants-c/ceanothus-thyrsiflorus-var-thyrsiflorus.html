                    <h1>Ceanothus thyrsiflorus var. thyrsiflorus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus thyrsiflorus var. thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the California ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its Mediterranean climate. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
