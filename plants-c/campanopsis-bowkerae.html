                    <h1>Campanopsis bowkerae</h1>
<p>Campanopsis bowkerae, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanopsis bowkerae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
