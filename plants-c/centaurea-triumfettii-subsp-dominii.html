<p>Centaurea triumfettii subsp.</p>
<p>dominii, commonly known as the Corsican star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical of the Centaurea genus.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
