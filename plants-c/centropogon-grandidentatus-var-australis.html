<p>Centropogon grandidentatus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sword fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, erect fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
