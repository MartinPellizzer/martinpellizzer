                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora var. portoricensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that can缠绕 around host vegetation. It is often found on plants such as Cucurbita and other members of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its native habitat.</p>
