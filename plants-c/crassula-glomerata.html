                    <h1>Crassula glomerata</h1>
<p>Crassula glomerata, commonly known as the Christmas or rock rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette, often with a reddish tinge when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the winter months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
