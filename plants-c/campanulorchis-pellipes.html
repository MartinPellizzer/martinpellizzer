                    <h1>Campanulorchis pellipes</h1>
<p>Campanulorchis pellipes, commonly known as the small bell orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
