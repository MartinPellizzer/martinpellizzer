                    <h1>Cuscuta approximata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta approximata, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thread-like, yellow stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on agricultural crops, weeds, and other plants, making it a common weed in many regions.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta approximata plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and serving as a food source for certain insects and animals.</p>
