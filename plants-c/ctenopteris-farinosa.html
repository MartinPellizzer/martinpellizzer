<p>Ctenopteris farinosa, commonly known as the farinose sea蒲公英, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
