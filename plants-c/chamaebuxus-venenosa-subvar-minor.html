                    <h1>Chamaebuxus venenosa subvar. minor</h1>
<p>Chamaebuxus venenosa subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as pines and firs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches to its host via a specialized structure called a haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and promoting biodiversity through its interactions with other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid contact with the plant and its berries.</p>
