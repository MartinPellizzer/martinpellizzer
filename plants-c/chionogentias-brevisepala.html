                    <h1>Chionogentias brevisepala</h1>
<p>Chionogentias brevisepala, commonly known as the short-winged snowblossom, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant foliage.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. The plant's leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
