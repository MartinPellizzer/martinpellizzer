<p>Cerastium fontanum subsp.</p>
<p>alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
