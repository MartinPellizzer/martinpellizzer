<p>Chamaefilix oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense heads and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Chamaefilix oligophylla is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common component of xeric ecosystems.</p>
