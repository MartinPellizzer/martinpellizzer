<p>Camphorata ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian camphor tree, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its leaves contain a high concentration of camphor, giving it its namesake and making it valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a critically endangered species.</p>
