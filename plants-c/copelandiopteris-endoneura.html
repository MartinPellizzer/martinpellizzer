<p>Copelandiopteris endoneura, commonly known as the Endoneura fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and finely divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, forested habitat, making it a notable component of understory vegetation.</p>
