<p>Castilleja agrestis, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pink to red, plume-like flowers that resemble smoke, hence its common name. It typically grows in open prairies and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender stems and small, narrow leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
