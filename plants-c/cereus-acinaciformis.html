                    <h1>Cereus acinaciformis</h1>
<p>Cereus acinaciformis, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its stems are covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cereus acinaciformis is well adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
