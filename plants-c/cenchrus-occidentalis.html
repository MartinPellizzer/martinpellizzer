                    <h1>Cenchrus occidentalis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus occidentalis, commonly known as western sandreed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system enables it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus occidentalis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
