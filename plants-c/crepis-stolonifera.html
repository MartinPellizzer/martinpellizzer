                    <h1>Crepis stolonifera</h1>
<p>Crepis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow with five petals. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in garden beds.</p>
<p>Crepis stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
