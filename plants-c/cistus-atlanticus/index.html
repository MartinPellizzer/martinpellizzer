<p>Cistus atlanticus is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of western Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is known for its fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. Cistus atlanticus is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
