<p>Cathartolinum sedoides, commonly known as the silverleaf sedoid, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Cathartolinum sedoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
