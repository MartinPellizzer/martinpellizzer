                    <h1>Cerophyllum douglasii</h1>
<p>Cerophyllum douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, with its leaves floating on the water surface. The plant has broad, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Cerophyllum douglasii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
