                    <h1>Cleistogenes squarrosa</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes squarrosa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes squarrosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
