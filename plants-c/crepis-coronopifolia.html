                    <h1>Crepis coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Crepis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crowned hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
