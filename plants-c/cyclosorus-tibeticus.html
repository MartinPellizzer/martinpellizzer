                    <h1>Cyclosorus tibeticus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, oligotrophic lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant's fronds are narrow and ribbon-like, with a distinct, spirally arranged pattern of leaves. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
