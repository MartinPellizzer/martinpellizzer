<p>Catevala atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, veined leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and striking coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
