                    <h1>Caladenia × intermedia</h1>
<p>Caladenia × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Caladenia carnosa and Caladenia latifolia.</p>
<p>It is native to southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of wasps or bees, aiding in pollination. Its flowering period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, and it is often found growing in open grasslands or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
