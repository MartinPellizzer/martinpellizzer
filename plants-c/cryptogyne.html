                    <h1>Cryptogyne</h1>
<p>Cryptogyne, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants that belong to the family Nychthemeralaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open at night. Cryptogyne species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Their roots anchor them to the substrate, while their leaves provide a surface for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The flowers of Cryptogyne are pollinated by nocturnal insects, which is an adaptation to their nighttime blooming cycle.</p>
