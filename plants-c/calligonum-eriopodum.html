                    <h1>Calligonum eriopodum</h1>
<p>Calligonum eriopodum, commonly known as the woolly calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calligonum eriopodum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
