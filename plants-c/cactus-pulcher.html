                <h1>Cactus pulcher</h1>
<p>Cactus pulcher, commonly known as the beautiful cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a columnar stem covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cactus pulcher is well adapted to desert environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
