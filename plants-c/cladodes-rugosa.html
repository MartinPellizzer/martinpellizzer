                    <h1>Cladodes rugosa</h1>
<p>Cladodes rugosa, commonly known as the rough cladode, is a unique plant characterized by its modified stems that function as leaves.</p>
<p>These cladodes are typically thick, fleshy, and covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is native to regions with harsh climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its structure allows it to perform photosynthesis efficiently while minimizing the risk of desiccation.</p>
<p>Cladodes rugosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
