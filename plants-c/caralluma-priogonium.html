                    <h1>Caralluma priogonium</h1>
<p>Caralluma priogonium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caralluma priogonium is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
