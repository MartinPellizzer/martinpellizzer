                    <h1>Cuscuta abyssinica f. breviloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta abyssinica f. breviloba, commonly known as the short-lobed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via haustoria. This species is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its botanical features include slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its specialized parasitic adaptations and ecological role in its habitat.</p>
