                    <h1>Capsicum chlorocladum</h1>
<p>Capsicum chlorocladum, commonly known as the chlorocladum pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species of chili pepper native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, with leaves that are typically lighter in color and more clustered compared to other Capsicum species. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red, depending on maturity. It thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant diversity.</p>
