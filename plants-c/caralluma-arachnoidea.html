<p>Caralluma arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider flower or desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has succulent stems and leaves adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Caralluma arachnoidea is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
