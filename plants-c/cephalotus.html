                    <h1>Cephalotus</h1>
<p>Cephalotus, commonly known as the butterwort, is a genus of flowering plants native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky, waxy substance to trap small insects. The plant's name derives from the Greek words "kephalos" meaning head and "tus" meaning a plant, referring to the rounded shape of its leaves. Cephalotus species are carnivorous, using their specialized leaves to supplement their nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring.</p>
