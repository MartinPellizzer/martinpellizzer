                    <h1>Cycas glauca</h1>
<p>Cycas glauca, commonly known as the blue cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. Cycas glauca is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ancient lineage make it a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
