                    <h1>Calonemorchis uliginosa</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant that thrives in wetland and peatland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs or marshes. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
