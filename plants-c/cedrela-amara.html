<p>Cedrela amara, commonly known as the yellow cedar or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
