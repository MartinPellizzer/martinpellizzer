                    <h1>Chartolepis finitima</h1>
<p>Chartolepis finitima, commonly known as the twilight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue petals that emit a subtle bioluminescent glow during dusk. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soils, while its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected by local conservation laws.</p>
