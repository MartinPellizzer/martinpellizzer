                    <h1>Cypripedium bouffordianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium bouffordianum, commonly known as the Boufford's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
