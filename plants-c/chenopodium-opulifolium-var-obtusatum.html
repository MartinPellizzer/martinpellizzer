                    <h1>Chenopodium opulifolium var. obtusatum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium opulifolium var. obtusatum, commonly known as blunt-leaf goosefoot, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits known as siliques. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
