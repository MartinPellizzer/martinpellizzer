<p>Caladenia attingens subsp.</p>
<p>attingens, commonly known as the Sturt's Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to South Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pale green to cream-colored flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
