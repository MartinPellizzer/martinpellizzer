                    <h1>Chrysosplenium pilosum var. valdepilosum</h1>
<p>Chrysosplenium pilosum var. valdepilosum, commonly known as the hairy chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
