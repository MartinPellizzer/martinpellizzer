                            <h1>Cheilanthes Aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Coral rock fern, scientifically known as Cheilanthes aurantiaca, is a unique and resilient member of the fern family found in arid and rocky environments. This plant is characterized by its vibrant orange spore cases, which give it its common name and make it easily identifiable. Thriving in harsh conditions, it often grows on limestone and other calcareous substrates, showcasing its adaptability to extreme climates. Despite its delicate appearance, the Coral rock fern is highly drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established. Its striking color and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
