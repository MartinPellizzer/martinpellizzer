<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
