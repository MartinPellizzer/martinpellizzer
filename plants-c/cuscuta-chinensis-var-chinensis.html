<p>Cuscuta chinensis var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and rice. It reproduces through seeds and can cause significant damage to agricultural plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host species.</p>
