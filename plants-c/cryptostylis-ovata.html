<p>Cryptostylis ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique hooded flower structure, with a broad, ovate labellum that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with prominent veining, and it produces small, round, yellowish fruits.</p>
<p>Cryptostylis ovata is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its growth and reproduction.</p>
