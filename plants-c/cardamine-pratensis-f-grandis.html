                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis f. grandis</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis f. grandis, commonly known as the large water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its larger leaf size compared to the typical form of Cardamine pratensis.</p>
