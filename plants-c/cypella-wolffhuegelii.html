                    <h1>Cypella wolffhuegelii</h1>
<p>Cypella wolffhuegelii, commonly known as the Wolffhuegel's cypella, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, umbel-like clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is typical for many members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cypella wolffhuegelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
