                    <h1>Cleistocactus glaucus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus glaucus, commonly known as the blue ghost cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a bluish-gray appearance due to its dense covering of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nocturnal anthesis. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus glaucus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit.</p>
