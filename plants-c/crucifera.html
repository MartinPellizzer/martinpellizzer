                    <h1>Crucifera</h1>
<p>Crucifera, commonly known as the mustard family, is a group of flowering plants characterized by their four-petaled flowers arranged in a cross shape, which gives the family its name.</p>
<p>Members of the crucifera family typically have capsules as their fruit type, which split open to release seeds. These plants are often found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and gardens. Many crucifera species are economically important for their edible parts, such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.</p>
<p>The family also includes some invasive species that can become problematic in certain environments.</p>
