<p>Calostephane huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√©n calostephane, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a finely hairy surface, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like arrangements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calostephane huillensis is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation studies.</p>
