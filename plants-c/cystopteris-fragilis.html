                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a soft, fragile texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
