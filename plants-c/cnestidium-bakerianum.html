                    <h1>Cnestidium bakerianum</h1>
<p>Cnestidium bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting insects and other small organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in environments where traditional plant nutrients are scarce.</p>
