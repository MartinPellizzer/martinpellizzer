                    <h1>Cardamine tenuifolia var. bracteata</h1>
<p>Cardamine tenuifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, white or greenish flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
