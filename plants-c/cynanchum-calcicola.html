                    <h1>Cynanchum calcicola</h1>
<p>Cynanchum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cynanchum calcicola is also noted for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
