<p>Callitriche autumnalis var. rivularis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is an annual species, completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
