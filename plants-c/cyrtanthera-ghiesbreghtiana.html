<p>Cyrtanthera ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces flowers on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
