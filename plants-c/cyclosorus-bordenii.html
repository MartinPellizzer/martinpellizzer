<p>Cyclosorus bordenii, commonly known as the Borden's water star, is a rare aquatic fern found in specific freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or along stream banks. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
