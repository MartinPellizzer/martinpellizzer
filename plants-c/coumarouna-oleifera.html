                    <h1>Coumarouna oleifera</h1>
<p>Coumarouna oleifera, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial oil.</p>
<p>Coumarouna oleifera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for local communities.</p>
