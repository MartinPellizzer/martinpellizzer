<p>Campanula scheuchzeri f. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, low-growing stems with small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white down. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
