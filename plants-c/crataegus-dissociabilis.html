                    <h1>Crataegus dissociabilis</h1>
<p>Crataegus dissociabilis, commonly known as the dissociable hawthorn, is a unique species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often irregularly shaped leaves that exhibit a peculiar ability to detach from the stem under certain environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are a source of food for various wildlife. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and somewhat enigmatic behavior, it is considered a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
