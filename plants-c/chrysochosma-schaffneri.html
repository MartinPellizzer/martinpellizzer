                    <h1>Chrysochosma schaffneri</h1>
<p>Chrysochosma schaffneri, commonly known as the golden ghost plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, this plant has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
