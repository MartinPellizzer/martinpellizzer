                    <h1>Cypripedium guttatum f. latifolium</h1>
<p>Cypripedium guttatum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its broad, leathery leaves are a distinguishing trait of this particular form, setting it apart from other members of the species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
