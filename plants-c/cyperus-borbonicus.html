                    <h1>Cyperus borbonicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus borbonicus, commonly known as the Madagascar flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus borbonicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
