<p>Cyclosorus excelsior, commonly known as the noble water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.
