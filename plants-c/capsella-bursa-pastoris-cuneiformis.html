<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris cuneiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped weed or common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure called a silique, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many temperate regions.</p>
