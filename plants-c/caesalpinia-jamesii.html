<p>Caesalpinia jamesii, commonly known as the desert false acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its seed pods are long, narrow, and covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Caesalpinia jamesii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
