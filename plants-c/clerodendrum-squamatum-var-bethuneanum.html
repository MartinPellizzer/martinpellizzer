<p>Clerodendrum squamatum var. bethuneanum, commonly known as the Bethune's flame bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, clustered within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
