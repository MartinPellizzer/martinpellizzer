                    <h1>Caenopteris thalictroides</h1>
<p>Caenopteris thalictroides, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a rare and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange fronds, which contrast sharply with its dark, leathery rhizomes. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments in its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
