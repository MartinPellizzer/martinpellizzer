                    <h1>Camptophytum</h1>
<p>Camptophytum, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a unique hybrid plant that combines the vibrant colors of the cyrtophyllum with the hardy structure of the euphorbia.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant's most distinctive feature is its swollen, colorful stem, which resembles a rounded, fleshy structure called a "cactus" despite not being a true cactus. Camptophytum is known for its striking red, orange, or yellow hues, which are produced by the cyrtophyllum component.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and eye-catching appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
