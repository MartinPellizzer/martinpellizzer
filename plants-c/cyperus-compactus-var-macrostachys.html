                    <h1>Cyperus compactus var. macrostachys</h1>
<p>Cyperus compactus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, pond edges, and along irrigation ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
