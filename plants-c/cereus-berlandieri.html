                    <h1>Cereus berlandieri</h1>
<p>Cereus berlandieri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>Cereus berlandieri is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
