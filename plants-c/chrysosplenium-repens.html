<p>Chrysosplenium repens, commonly known as creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats.</p>
