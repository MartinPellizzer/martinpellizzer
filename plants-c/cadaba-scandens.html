<p>Cadaba scandens, commonly known as the climbing cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and can climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
