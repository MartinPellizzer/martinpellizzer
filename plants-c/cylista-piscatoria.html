                    <h1>Cylista piscatoria</h1>
<p>Cylista piscatoria, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a clover-like pattern, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Cylista piscatoria is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water.</p>
