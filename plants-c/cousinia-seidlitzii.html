                    <h1>Cousinia seidlitzii</h1>
<p>Cousinia seidlitzii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Cousinia seidlitzii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
