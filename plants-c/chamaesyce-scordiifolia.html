<p>Chamaesyce scordiifolia, commonly known as the stinging leaf or false nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Portulacaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce scordiifolia is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas.</p>
