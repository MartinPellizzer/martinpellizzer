                    <h1>Coryphopteris marquesensis</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesas holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
