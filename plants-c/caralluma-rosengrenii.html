                    <h1>Caralluma rosengrenii</h1>
<p>Caralluma rosengrenii, commonly known as the Indian torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil surface.</p>
<p>Caralluma rosengrenii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
