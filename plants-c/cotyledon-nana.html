                    <h1>Cotyledon nana</h1>
<p>Cotyledon nana, commonly known as the dwarf cotyledon, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins, which help it store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
