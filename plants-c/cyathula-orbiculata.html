                    <h1>Cyathula orbiculata</h1>
<p>Cyathula orbiculata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water caltrop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, floating leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
