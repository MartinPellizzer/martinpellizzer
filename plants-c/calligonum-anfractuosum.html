                    <h1>Calligonum anfractuosum</h1>
<p>Calligonum anfractuosum, commonly known as the warty saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, warty, and often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to desert and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Calligonum anfractuosum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
