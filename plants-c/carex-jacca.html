                    <h1>Carex jacca</h1>
<p>Carex jacca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, greenish flower spikes in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical, three-sided seed capsules.</p>
<p>Carex jacca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
