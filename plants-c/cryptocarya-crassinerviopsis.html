                    <h1>Cryptocarya crassinerviopsis</h1>
<p>Cryptocarya crassinerviopsis, commonly known as the broad-veined cryptocarya, is a species of evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, with a dense canopy and smooth, dark bark. Its leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and have prominent, parallel veins, which give it its specific epithet "crassinerviopsis.".</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe that matures to a dark color, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
