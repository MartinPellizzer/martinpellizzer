                            <h1>Coryphantha Sneedii Var. Sandbergii</h1>
<p>Sandberg's coryphantha, scientifically known as Coryphantha sneedii var. sandbergii, is a rare and striking member of the cactaceae family native to the deserts of Texas and New Mexico. This unique plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Sandberg's coryphantha is considered endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest. Its distinctive appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and desert enthusiasts alike.</p>
