                    <h1>Calligonum roseum</h1>
<p>Calligonum roseum, commonly known as the pink saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in salty and drought-prone soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with dry climates.</p>
<p>Calligonum roseum plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
