                    <h1>Chenopodium wolfii</h1>
<p>Chenopodium wolfii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Chenopodium wolfii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
