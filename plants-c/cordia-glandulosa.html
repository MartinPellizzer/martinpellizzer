                    <h1>Cordia glandulosa</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Codia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Cordia glandulosa is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its resinous secretions have been used by Indigenous Australians for various traditional purposes.</p>
