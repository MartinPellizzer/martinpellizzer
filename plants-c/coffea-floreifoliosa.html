                    <h1>Coffea floreifoliosa</h1>
<p>Coffea floreifoliosa, commonly known as the floral-leaf coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit produces seeds that are used for coffee, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
