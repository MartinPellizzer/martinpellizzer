                    <h1>Cypripedium luteum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium luteum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the golden moccasin, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive green lip and a prominent, spurred dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forests and has a pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
