<p>Cercocarpus, commonly known as curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a genus of shrubs native to North America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, rounded leaves that often curl at the edges, giving them their common name. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The flowers are usually yellow and borne in clusters, while the fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule.</p>
<p>Cercocarpus species are valued for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
