<p>Clemensiella mariae, commonly known as the Marie's clemensiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, are often brightly colored, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Clemensiella mariae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
