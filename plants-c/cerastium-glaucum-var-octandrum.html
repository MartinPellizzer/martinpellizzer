                    <h1>Cerastium glaucum var. octandrum</h1>
<p>Cerastium glaucum var. octandrum, commonly known as the silverweed or white deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to its often damp habitat.</p>
