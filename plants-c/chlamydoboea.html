<p>It consists of several species native to South Africa, characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plants typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them survive in arid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink, red, or purple, and they are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Chlamydoboea species are generally easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
