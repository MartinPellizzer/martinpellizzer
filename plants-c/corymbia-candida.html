                    <h1>Corymbia candida</h1>
<p>Corymbia candida, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Corymbia candida is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
