                    <h1>Cystopteris atrovirens</h1>
<p>Cystopteris atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, and they possess a unique structure that allows them to float on the surface of water. Cystopteris atrovirens thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
