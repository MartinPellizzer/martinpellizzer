<p>Celosia effusa, commonly known as flame flower or croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, feather-like bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered at the base of the bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Celosia effusa is often used in floral arrangements due to its vibrant colors and long-lasting blooms.</p>
