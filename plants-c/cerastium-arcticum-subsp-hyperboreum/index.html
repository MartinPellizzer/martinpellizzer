                            <h1>Cerastium Arcticum Subsp. Hyperboreum</h1>
<p>Arctic mouse-ear chickweed, scientifically known as Cerastium arcticum subsp. hyperboreum, is a resilient plant adapted to extreme cold and barren environments. Found in the high Arctic and subarctic regions, it thrives in rocky soils and tundra landscapes where few other plants can survive. This small, low-growing species has tiny, hairy leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity. Despite its modest size, the Arctic mouse-ear chickweed is a symbol of nature's ability to endure and flourish in the harshest conditions.</p>
