                    <h1>Centaurea iljinii</h1>
<p>Centaurea iljinii, commonly known as Iljin's cornflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Centaurea iljinii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
