<p>Cassytha americana var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy cassytha, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinct appearance.</p>
<p>The hairy cassytha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
