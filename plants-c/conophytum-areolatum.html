<p>Conophytum areolatum, commonly known as the "Karoo star" or "dwarf ice plant," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Conophytum areolatum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in crevices or on rock surfaces.</p>
