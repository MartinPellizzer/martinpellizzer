                    <h1>Cochlearia rotundifolia var. alpina</h1>
<p>Cochlearia rotundifolia var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients.</p>
