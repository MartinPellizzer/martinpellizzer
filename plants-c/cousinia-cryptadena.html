<p>Cousinia cryptadena, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia cryptadena is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited rainfall.</p>
