<p>Commiphora opobalsamum var. ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on wind for pollination.</p>
