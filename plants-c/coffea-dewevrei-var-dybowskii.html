                    <h1>Coffea dewevrei var. dybowskii</h1>
<p>Coffea dewevrei var. dybowskii, commonly known as the Dybowskii coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the highland regions of eastern Africa, particularly in parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
