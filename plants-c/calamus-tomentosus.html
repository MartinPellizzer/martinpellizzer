<p>Calamus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly arrowroot, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous stems that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on erect, leafless stalks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Calamus tomentosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
