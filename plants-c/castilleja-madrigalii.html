                    <h1>Castilleja madrigalii</h1>
<p>Castilleja madrigalii, commonly known as Madrigal's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Castilleja madrigalii plays an important role in pollination and is often found in association with other native flora in its ecosystem.</p>
