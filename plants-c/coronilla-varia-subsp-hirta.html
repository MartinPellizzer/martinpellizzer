<p>Coronilla varia subsp.</p>
<p>hirta, commonly known as hairy crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>This species is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
