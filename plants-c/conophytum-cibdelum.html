<p>Conophytum cibdelum, commonly known as the "Cape cress," is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or summer. It grows close to the ground, forming a low, compact rosette that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Conophytum cibdelum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
