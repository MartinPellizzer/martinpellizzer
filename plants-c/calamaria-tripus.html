<p>Calamaria tripus, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with distinct lobes that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Calamaria tripus has a simple reproductive system, relying on spores for propagation rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
