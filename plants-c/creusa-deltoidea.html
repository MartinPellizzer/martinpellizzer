<p>Creusa deltoidea, commonly known as the delta creosotebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Creusa deltoidea is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
