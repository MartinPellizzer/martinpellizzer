                    <h1>Cuscuta major</h1>
<p>Cuscuta major, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
