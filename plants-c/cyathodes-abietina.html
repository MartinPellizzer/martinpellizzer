                    <h1>Cyathodes abietina</h1>
<p>Cyathodes abietina, commonly known as the silver fir clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in a distinctive, cone-like formation known as a cyathodium. Cyathodes abietina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
