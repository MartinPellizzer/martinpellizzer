                    <h1>Carex aquatilis var. cuspidata</h1>
<p>Carex aquatilis var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly pointed at the tips, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
