                    <h1>Cistanche deserticola var. flabellata</h1>
<p>Cistanche deserticola var. flabellata, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Haloxylon. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a fleshy, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions with deep root systems that can penetrate host plants.</p>
<p>This species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
