<p>Cheilanthes eckloniana, commonly known as the rock holly or stone fern, is a perennial fern native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes eckloniana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
