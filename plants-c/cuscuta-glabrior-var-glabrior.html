                    <h1>Cuscuta glabrior var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Cuscuta glabrior var. glabrior, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of environments, including agricultural fields and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
