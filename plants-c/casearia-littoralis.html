<p>Casearia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal casearia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of tropical America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
