                    <h1>Cheilanthes caudata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in poor, rocky soils and withstand drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes caudata is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, making it well-adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
