<p>Callista williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's callista, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in sandy soils near the coast and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
