                    <h1>Cuscuta lehmanniana var. esquamata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lehmanniana var. esquamata, commonly known as the silverleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
