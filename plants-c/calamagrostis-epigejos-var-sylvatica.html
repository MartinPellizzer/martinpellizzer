                    <h1>Calamagrostis epigejos var. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis epigejos var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silvergrass or woodland panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
