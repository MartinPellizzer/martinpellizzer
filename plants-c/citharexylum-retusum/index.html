<p>Citharexylum, scientifically known as Citharexylum retusum, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is prized for its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate aroma to gardens and landscapes. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hedges, containers, and tropical gardens. Its fast growth rate and adaptability to various soil types contribute to its widespread cultivation. Despite its beauty, Citharexylum retusum requires careful pruning to maintain its shape and encourage continuous flowering.</p>
