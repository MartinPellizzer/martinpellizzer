                    <h1>Carex trongii</h1>
<p>Carex trongii, commonly known as the Vietnamese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex trongii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
