                    <h1>Cuscuta intermedia</h1>
<p>Cuscuta intermedia, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, and it can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Cuscuta intermedia is often considered a weed due to its ability to reduce the growth and yield of crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings.</p>
