                    <h1>Cissus thyrsiflora</h1>
<p>Cissus thyrsiflora, commonly known as the coral vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that transition into bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cissus thyrsiflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and rapid growth habit.</p>
