<p>Cissus aconitifolia, commonly known as the Indian Snowball or the Silver Cissus, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which resemble snowballs. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread easily.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
