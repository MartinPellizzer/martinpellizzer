                    <h1>Caulinia exima</h1>
<p>Caulinia exima, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme conditions with deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caulinia exima is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
