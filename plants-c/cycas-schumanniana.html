                    <h1>Cycas schumanniana</h1>
<p>Cycas schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
