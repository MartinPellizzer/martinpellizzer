                    <h1>Calophyllum castaneum</h1>
<p>Calophyllum castaneum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish-brown color, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
