                    <h1>Campylanthus salsoloides var. leucantha</h1>
<p>Campylanthus salsoloides var. leucantha, commonly known as silverleaf campylanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought and high sunlight exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
