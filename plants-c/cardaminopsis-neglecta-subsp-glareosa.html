<p>Cardaminopsis neglecta subsp.</p>
<p>glareosa, commonly known as the glabrous water cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in wet soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the species.</p>
