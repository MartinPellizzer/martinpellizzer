                <h1>Caloglossum flabellatum</h1>
<p>Caloglossum flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-winged sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the order Actinioidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, fan-like structure composed of delicate, feathery tentacles that surround a central mouth. The organism lacks a true skeleton and instead relies on a flexible mesogloea for structural support. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms.</p>
