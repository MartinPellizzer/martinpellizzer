<p>Cousinia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia squarrosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
