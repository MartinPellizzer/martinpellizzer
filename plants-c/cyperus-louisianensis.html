<p>Cyperus louisianensis, commonly known as the Louisiana flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus louisianensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils.</p>
