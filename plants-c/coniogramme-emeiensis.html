                    <h1>Coniogramme emeiensis</h1>
<p>Coniogramme emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei coniogramme, is a rare and endangered fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
