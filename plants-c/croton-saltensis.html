                    <h1>Croton saltensis</h1>
<p>Croton saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to saline conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
