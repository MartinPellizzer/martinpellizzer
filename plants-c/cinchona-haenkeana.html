                    <h1>Cinchona haenkeana</h1>
<p>Cinchona haenkeana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains compounds similar to quinine, though it is not as widely used medicinally as other cinchona species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
