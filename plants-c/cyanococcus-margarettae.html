<p>Cyanococcus margarettae, commonly known as Margaretta's blue moss, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and vibrant blue-green coloration, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments.
