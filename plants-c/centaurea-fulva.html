                    <h1>Centaurea fulva</h1>
<p>Centaurea fulva, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny foliage, which are adaptations to its arid and semi-arid habitats. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and compete effectively with native vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
<p>Centaurea fulva is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
