<p>Cylindrolobus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones bearing white, fleshy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
