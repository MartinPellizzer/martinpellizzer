                    <h1>Comanthosphace stellipila var. japonica</h1>
<p>Comanthosphace stellipila var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese star moss, is a rare and delicate moss species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, clustered growth pattern and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a low-growing habit with small, overlapping leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. It is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
