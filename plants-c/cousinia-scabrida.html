                    <h1>Cousinia scabrida</h1>
<p>Cousinia scabrida, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia scabrida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
