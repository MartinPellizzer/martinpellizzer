                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. schiraziana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. schiraziana, commonly known as the Persian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it commonly infests crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of host tissues and establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
