                    <h1>Coffea wightiana</h1>
<p>Coffea wightiana, commonly known as Wight's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its fruit, which resembles a small orange, contains two seeds used for coffee production.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
