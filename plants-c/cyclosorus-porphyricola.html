<p>Cyclosorus porphyricola, commonly known as the purple rock fern, is a rare and delicate species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive purple hue on the underside. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in rocky or muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus porphyricola is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
