<p>Chionogentias chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky habitats, where it is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Chionogentias chathamica is a rare species, with limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
