                    <h1>Centaurea nigra var. radiata</h1>
<p>Centaurea nigra var. radiata, commonly known as the radiate nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are typically arranged in a central disk surrounded by ray florets. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides.</p>
