<p>Clidemia simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant over time.</p>
