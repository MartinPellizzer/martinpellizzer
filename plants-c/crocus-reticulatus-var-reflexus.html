                    <h1>Crocus reticulatus var. reflexus</h1>
<p>Crocus reticulatus var. reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive reflexed (curled backward) petal shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit, often emerging before many other spring flowers.</p>
