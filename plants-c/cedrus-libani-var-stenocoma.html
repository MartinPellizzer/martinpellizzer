                    <h1>Cedrus libani var. stenocoma</h1>
<p>Cedrus libani var. stenocoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cedar of Lebanon, is a rare and ancient variety of the cedar tree native to the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Cedrus libani. The plant produces aromatic, cone-shaped seedlings that are typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation.</p>
