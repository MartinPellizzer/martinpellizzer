                    <h1>Cephalophyllum parvulum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf headplant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
