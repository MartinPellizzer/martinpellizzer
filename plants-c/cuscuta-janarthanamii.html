<p>Cuscuta janarthanamii, commonly known as the Janarthanam dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers and is native to parts of South and Southeast Asia. It is often found growing on various herbaceous plants and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host.</p>
