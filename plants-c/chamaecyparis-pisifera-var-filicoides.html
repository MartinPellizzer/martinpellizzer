                    <h1>Chamaecyparis pisifera var. filicoides</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis pisifera var. filicoides, commonly known as the Japanese Falsecypress or lacey falsecypress, is a variant of the Japanese cedar.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree that exhibits a unique, feathery appearance due to its finely divided, scale-like leaves. The foliage is a soft, silvery-green, which gives the plant a delicate, lace-like texture. It produces small, cone-like structures that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with mild, humid climates.</p>
