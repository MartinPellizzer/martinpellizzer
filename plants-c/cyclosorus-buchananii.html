                    <h1>Cyclosorus buchananii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus buchananii, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that radiate from a central stem, giving it a wheel-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus buchananii is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and is sometimes used in water gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
