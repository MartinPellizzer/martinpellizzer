                    <h1>Cactus crispatus</h1>
<p>Cactus crispatus, commonly known as the brittle cactus, is a species native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, rough texture. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus crispatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
