                    <h1>Chilita milleri</h1>
<p>Chilita milleri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lantern-like inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment.</p>
<p>Chilita milleri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
