                    <h1>Cuscuta pellucida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pellucida, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Cuscuta pellucida is often considered a weed due to its ability to weaken host plants and reduce crop yields.</p>
