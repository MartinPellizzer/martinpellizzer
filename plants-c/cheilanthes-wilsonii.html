<p>Cheilanthes wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with short, thick rhizomes and dense clusters of dark green, leathery fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes wilsonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
