                    <h1>Croton foetens</h1>
<p>Croton foetens, commonly known as the stinking croton, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent.</p>
