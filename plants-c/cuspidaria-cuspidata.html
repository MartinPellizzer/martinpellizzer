<p>Cuspidaria cuspidata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a type of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its central axis. It possesses true roots, stems, and leaves, distinguishing it from non-vascular plants like mosses.</p>
<p>Cuspidaria cuspidata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
