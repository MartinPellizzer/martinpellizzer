                    <h1>Cassida major</h1>
<p>Cassida major, commonly known as the giant leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated body and vibrant green coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. The plant it feeds on, typically certain species of Euphorbia, provides both food and shelter for the beetle. Its larvae are often found feeding on the leaves, contributing to the plant's natural ecological balance.</p>
<p>The beetle's presence can indicate the health of the ecosystem in which it resides.</p>
