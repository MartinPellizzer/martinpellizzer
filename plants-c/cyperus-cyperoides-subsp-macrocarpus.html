<p>Cyperus cyperoides subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, triangular pericarp, which aids in their dispersal by water or animals.</p>
