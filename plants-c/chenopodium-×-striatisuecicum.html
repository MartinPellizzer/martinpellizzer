<p>Chenopodium × striatisuecicum, commonly known as the hybrid goosefoot, is a species resulting from the cross between Chenopodium album and Chenopodium berteroianum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across the Americas. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic variability and adaptability to different environments.</p>
