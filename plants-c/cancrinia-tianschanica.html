                    <h1>Cancrinia tianschanica</h1>
<p>Cancrinia tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Cancrinia tianschanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
