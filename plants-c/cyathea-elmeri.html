<p>Cyathea elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyathea elmeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, temperate climates with adequate shade.</p>
