                    <h1>Chthonia ciliaris</h1>
<p>Chthonia ciliaris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as the understory of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
