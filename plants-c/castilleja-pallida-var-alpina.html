                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. alpina</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually linear and its stems are erect, contributing to its distinctive appearance in its native environment.</p>
