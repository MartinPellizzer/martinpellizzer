<p>Chassalia umbraticola subsp.</p>
<p>geophila, commonly known as the shadow chassalia, is a herbaceous plant native to shaded, moist forest environments. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range.</p>
