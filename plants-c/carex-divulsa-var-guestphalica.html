<p>Carex divulsa var. guestphalica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control.</p>
