                    <h1>Cuscuta globularis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta globularis, commonly known as the globe dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, round shape that gives it its common name. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found growing on plants such as grasses and sedges in open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
