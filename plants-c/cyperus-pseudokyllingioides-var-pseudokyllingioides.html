<p>Cyperus pseudokyllingioides var. pseudokyllingioides, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its root system is adapted for water retention, making it a common indicator species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
