                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum proles trifolii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum proles trifolii, commonly known as the trailing dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to hosts such as legumes or grasses using specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
