                    <h1>Cycas media</h1>
<p>Cycas media, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, feather-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces cones, with male cones at the base and female cones at the top, a feature typical of cycads. Cycas media is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
