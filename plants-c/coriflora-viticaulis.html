                    <h1>Coriflora viticaulis</h1>
<p>Coriflora viticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coralflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, coral-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements and limited availability in horticultural markets.</p>
