<p>Cousinia heterolepis, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia heterolepis plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
