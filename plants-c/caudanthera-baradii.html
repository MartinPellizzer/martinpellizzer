                    <h1>Caudanthera baradii</h1>
<p>Caudanthera baradii, commonly known as the Baradii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the remote highlands of the Baradii Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, pale lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it highly dependent on specific microclimates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caudanthera baradii is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
