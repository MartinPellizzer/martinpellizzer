<p>Craterosiphon, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like structure and is typically found in marine environments. The plant forms dense, carpet-like colonies on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. Craterosiphon is capable of photosynthesis and plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and rapid growth make it an important indicator of water quality in coastal areas.</p>
