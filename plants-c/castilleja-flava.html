<p>Castilleja flava, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and has a root system that connects to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Castilleja flava plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community composition through its parasitic relationship with other species.</p>
