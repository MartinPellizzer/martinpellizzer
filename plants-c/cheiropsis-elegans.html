<p>Cheiropsis elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
