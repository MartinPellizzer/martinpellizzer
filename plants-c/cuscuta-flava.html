                    <h1>Cuscuta flava</h1>
<p>Cuscuta flava, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Cuscuta flava plays a role in ecological systems but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
