<p>Clintonia borealis f. lateralis, commonly known as the late-flowering white bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom later in the season than the typical form of Clintonia borealis. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and is often found in rich, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
