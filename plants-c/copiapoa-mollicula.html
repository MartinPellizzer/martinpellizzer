<p>Copiapoa mollicula, commonly known as the soft copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid climates.</p>
