                    <h1>Cryptandra australis</h1>
<p>Cryptandra australis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
