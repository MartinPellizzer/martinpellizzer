                    <h1>Cyclosorus nymphalis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus nymphalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to freshwater environments in temperate regions. The plant has thin, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus nymphalis is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it plays a part in maintaining water clarity and supporting aquatic life.</p>
