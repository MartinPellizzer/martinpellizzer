<p>Caralluma bredae var. thomallae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom at night, hence its common name. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in rock gardens due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Caralluma bredae var. thomallae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
