                    <h1>Cypripedium montanum f. praetertinctum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium montanum f. praetertinctum, commonly known as the alpine lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a deep pink or reddish hue and a unique slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, elegant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
