                    <h1>Cyperus pilosus var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pilosus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in marshy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced flower count compared to the typical form of Cyperus pilosus.</p>
