                <h1>Cuscuta suksdorfii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta suksdorfii, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is often found parasitizing shrubs and grasses, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecosystems where it is present.</p>
