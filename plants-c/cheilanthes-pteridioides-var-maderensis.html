<p>Cheilanthes pteridioides var. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's rockcap, is a fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered close to the ground. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
