<p>Calamagrostis podophora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that turns a striking coppery color in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
