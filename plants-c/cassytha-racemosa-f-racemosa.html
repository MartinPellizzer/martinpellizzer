                    <h1>Cassytha racemosa f. racemosa</h1>
<p>Cassytha racemosa f. racemosa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its slender, thread-like stems can缠绕 around various host species. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its reproductive strategy involves producing copious amounts of tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
