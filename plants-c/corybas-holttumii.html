<p>Corybas holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's hooded orchid, is a unique member of the兰科 (Orchidaceae) family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the genus Corybas. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually dark-colored, ranging from deep purple to black, and are often adorned with intricate patterns.</p>
