                    <h1>Cyclosorus erubescens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with yellowish-green petals, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus erubescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
