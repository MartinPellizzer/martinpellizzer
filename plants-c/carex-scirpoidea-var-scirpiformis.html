<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
