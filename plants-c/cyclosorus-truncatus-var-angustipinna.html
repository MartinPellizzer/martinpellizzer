                    <h1>Cyclosorus truncatus var. angustipinna</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus truncatus var. angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are often used in aquascaping due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures that develop on the underside of its leaves.</p>
