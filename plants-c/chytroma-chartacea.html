                    <h1>Chytroma chartacea</h1>
<p>Chytroma chartacea, commonly known as the parchment lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green or brown coloration. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
