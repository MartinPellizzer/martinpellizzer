                    <h1>Cereus warmingii</h1>
<p>Cereus warmingii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a cactus species characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its growth is slow, and it requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom once a year, adding a striking visual element to its otherwise simple appearance.</p>
