<p>Centaurea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink or purple, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
