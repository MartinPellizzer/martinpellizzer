                    <h1>Cypripedium mastersianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium mastersianum, commonly known as the Masters' lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
