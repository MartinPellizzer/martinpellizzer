                    <h1>Corallorhiza indica</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza indica, commonly known as the Indian coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces a cluster of small, reddish-brown flowers with a unique, coral-like appearance. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb water and minerals from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
