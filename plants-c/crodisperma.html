<p>Crodisperma, commonly known as the bladder nut or bladderleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit capsules that resemble bladders, which give the plant its common name. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and have a somewhat aromatic scent. Crodisperma species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in grassy or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
