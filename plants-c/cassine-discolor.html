                    <h1>Cassine discolor</h1>
<p>Cassine discolor, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its smooth, white bark and succulent leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. It thrives in brackish or saltwater tidal zones, playing a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life.</p>
<p>Cassine discolor is also notable for its ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves, adapting well to its challenging coastal habitat.</p>
