<p>Carex monotropa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Carex monotropa is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
