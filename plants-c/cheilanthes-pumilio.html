                    <h1>Cheilanthes pumilio</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on limestone or sandstone outcrops. The plant has a compact rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, linear leaves. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive and resilient member of the rock-dwelling flora.</p>
