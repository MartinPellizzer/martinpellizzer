                    <h1>Chitonia albicans</h1>
<p>Chitonia albicans, commonly known as the white chiton, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Chitonidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, shell-like body covered in calcareous plates that provide protection. The plant-like appearance of its body, with rows of overlapping plates, gives it a distinct botanical appearance. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches itself to rocky surfaces using its muscular foot.</p>
<p>While not a true plant, its structure and habitat make it an interesting subject in marine botany.</p>
