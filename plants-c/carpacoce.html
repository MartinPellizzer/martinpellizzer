                    <h1>Carpacoce</h1>
<p>Carpacoce, commonly known as the "flowering fern," is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of true ferns. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Carpacoce thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
