<p>Cirsium albescens, commonly known as the white thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and tall, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and thick leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cirsium albescens is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
