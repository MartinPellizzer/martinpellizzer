                    <h1>Condylocarpon gracile</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon gracile, commonly known as the slender sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like thallus that is often found in intertidal zones. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and it reproduces through the release of motile zoospores. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity and temperature makes it a resilient species in dynamic environments.</p>
