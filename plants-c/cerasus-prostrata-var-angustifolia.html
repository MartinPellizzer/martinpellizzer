                    <h1>Cerasus prostrata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Cerasus prostrata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cherry shrub, is a compact, spreading deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
