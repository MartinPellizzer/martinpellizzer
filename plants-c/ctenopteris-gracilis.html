                <h1>Ctenopteris gracilis</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris gracilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
