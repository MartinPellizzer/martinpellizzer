<p>Copiapoa humilis var. variispinata, commonly known as the "Coppens" cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines that provide insulation and protection from extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil, minimal water, and full sun to thrive.</p>
