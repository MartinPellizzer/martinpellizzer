                    <h1>Cuscuta lehmanniana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lehmanniana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal through the feces of animals. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is often found on various flowering plants, including legumes and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
