                            <h1>Cystorchis Gracilis</h1>
<p>Cystorchis gracilis is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in Asia. It is known for its slender, grass-like appearance and small, pale flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
