<p>Chrysopogon aciculatus var. echinulatus, commonly known as the spiny needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
