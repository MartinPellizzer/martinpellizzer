                    <h1>Crocodilium</h1>
<p>Crocodilium, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, elongated leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
