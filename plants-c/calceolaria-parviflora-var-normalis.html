                    <h1>Calceolaria parviflora var. normalis</h1>
<p>Calceolaria parviflora var. normalis, commonly known as the small-flowered slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that resemble tiny slippers, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm, producing clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
