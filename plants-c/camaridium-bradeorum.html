<p>Camaridium bradeorum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that resemble small bells, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Camaridium bradeorum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
