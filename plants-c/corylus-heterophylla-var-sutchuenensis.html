<p>Corylus heterophylla var. sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, which is a key feature of the species. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, typically ripening in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this variety lies in its morphological variability and potential horticultural value.</p>
