                    <h1>Cyrtandra × pupukeaensis</h1>
<p>Cyrtandra × pupukeaensis, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cyrtandra × pupukeaensis is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's native forests, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
