<p>Calligonum bucocladum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, candle-like growth habit with dense, spiny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, woody fruits. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it well-suited for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
