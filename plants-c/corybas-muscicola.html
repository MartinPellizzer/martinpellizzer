                    <h1>Corybas muscicola</h1>
<p>Corybas muscicola, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulb. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a specialized structure called a labellum, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest floors or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
