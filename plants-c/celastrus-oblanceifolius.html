                    <h1>Celastrus oblanceifolius</h1>
<p>Celastrus oblanceifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Its stems are woody and often twine around supporting structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and fruits are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within tropical ecosystems.</p>
