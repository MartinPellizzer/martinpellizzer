<p>Cyclosorus jinghongensis, commonly known as the Jinghong cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
