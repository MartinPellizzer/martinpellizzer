<p>Cinna racemosa, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Cinna racemosa is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
