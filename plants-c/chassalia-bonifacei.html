<p>Chassalia bonifacei, commonly known as the Boniface's chassalia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant is distinguished by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
