<p>Chenopodina minima, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of wax, which reduces water loss and aids in survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Chenopodina minima is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
