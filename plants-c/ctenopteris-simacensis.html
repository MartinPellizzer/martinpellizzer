                    <h1>Ctenopteris simacensis</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris simacensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of marine fern that thrives in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are adapted to withstand tidal fluctuations and saltwater exposure. The plant possesses a complex root system that anchors it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal over long distances.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris simacensis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
