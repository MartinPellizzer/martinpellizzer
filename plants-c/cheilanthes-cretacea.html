                    <h1>Cheilanthes cretacea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes cretacea, commonly known as the Crete rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact plant with a rosette of lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes cretacea is often found growing on limestone or in crevices, making it a characteristic species of arid and semi-arid landscapes.</p>
