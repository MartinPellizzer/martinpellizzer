                    <h1>Cereus serpentinus var. strictior</h1>
<p>Cereus serpentinus var. strictior, commonly known as the strict cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and a distinctive lack of branching. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'strictior' refers to its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Cereus serpentinus.</p>
