<p>Centaurea busambarensis, commonly known as the Busambarensis thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a perennial species characterized by its upright, spiny stems and vibrant purple to red flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and arid habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Centaurea busambarensis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native range.</p>
