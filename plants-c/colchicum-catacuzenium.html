<p>Colchicum catacuzenium, commonly known as the Armenian colchic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>
<p>It produces striking, violet-blue flowers during the late spring to early summer, typically emerging from a tunicated corm. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
