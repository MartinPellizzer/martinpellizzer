<p>Ctenopteris moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near streams or in moist forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens.</p>
