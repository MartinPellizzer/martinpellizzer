                    <h1>Celsia serpentinica</h1>
<p>Celsia serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine celsia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky, serpentine soil environments, which are often inhospitable to most other plant species. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological niche makes it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
