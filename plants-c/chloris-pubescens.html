<p>Chloris pubescens, commonly known as rough brome, is a grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Chloris pubescens is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
