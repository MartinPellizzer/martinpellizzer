<p>Chilodia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that resemble those of the true grass family. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Chilodia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its striking floral display also makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in moist climates.</p>
