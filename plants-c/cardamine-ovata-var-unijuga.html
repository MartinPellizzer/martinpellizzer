                    <h1>Cardamine ovata var. unijuga</h1>
<p>Cardamine ovata var. unijuga, commonly known as the single-lobed water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette, and its small, white flowers bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with only a single basal lobed leaflet.</p>
