                    <h1>Cracca canescens</h1>
<p>Cracca canescens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its fleshy leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cracca canescens is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
