                    <h1>Cryptocoryne fusca</h1>
<p>Cryptocoryne fusca, commonly known as the black water cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often appear almost black in color, especially in low-light conditions. This plant thrives in soft, acidic, and low-nutrient waters, making it a popular choice for blackwater aquariums. Its rhizomes form dense, bushy growths that help stabilize substrates and provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Cryptocoryne fusca is known for its resilience and ability to adapt to varying water conditions, though it requires careful maintenance to prevent algae overgrowth.</p>
