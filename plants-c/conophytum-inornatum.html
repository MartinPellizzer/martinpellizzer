                    <h1>Conophytum inornatum</h1>
<p>Conophytum inornatum, commonly known as the "Bottle Plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubular structures, giving it a unique, bottle-like appearance.</p>
<p>Conophytum inornatum is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
