                    <h1>Carex mossii</h1>
<p>Carex mossii, commonly known as Moss's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Carex mossii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions.</p>
