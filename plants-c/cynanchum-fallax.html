                    <h1>Cynanchum fallax</h1>
<p>Cynanchum fallax, commonly known as the false milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its milky sap, like that of other milkweeds, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cynanchum fallax is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
