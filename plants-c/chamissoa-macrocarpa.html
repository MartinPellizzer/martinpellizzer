<p>Chamissoa macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited chamissoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chamissoa macrocarpa produces large, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
