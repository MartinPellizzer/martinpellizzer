<p>Cistus barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>

The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
