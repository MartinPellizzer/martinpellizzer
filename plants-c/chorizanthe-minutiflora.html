                    <h1>Chorizanthe minutiflora</h1>
<p>Chorizanthe minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky habitats. It produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
