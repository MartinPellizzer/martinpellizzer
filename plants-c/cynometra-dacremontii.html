                    <h1>Cynometra dacremontii</h1>
<p>Cynometra dacremontii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local craftsmanship and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
