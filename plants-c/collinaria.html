                    <h1>Collinaria</h1>
<p>Collinaria, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Collinaria species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often hairy leaves. They produce umbellate inflorescences with small white or pale yellow flowers, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest.</p>
