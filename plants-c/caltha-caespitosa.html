                    <h1>Caltha caespitosa</h1>
<p>Caltha caespitosa, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by green sepals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Caltha caespitosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems.</p>
