<p>Cephalanthera × salaevensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and beautiful orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cephalanthera damasonium and Cephalanthera formosa, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the orchid family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
