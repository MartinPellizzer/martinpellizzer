                    <h1>Coryphantha chlorantha var. deserti</h1>
<p>Coryphantha chlorantha var. deserti, commonly known as the Desert Blue Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a bluish-green coloration, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its spines are short and usually pale, providing protection while minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
