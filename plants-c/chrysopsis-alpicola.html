                    <h1>Chrysopsis alpicola</h1>
<p>Chrysopsis alpicola, commonly known as the alpine chrysopsis, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. This species typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow to orange flowers are adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor soils of its environment.</p>
<p>Chrysopsis alpicola plays a role in pollination and is often found in alpine ecosystems with limited plant diversity.</p>
