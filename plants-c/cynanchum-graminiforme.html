                    <h1>Cynanchum graminiforme</h1>
<p>Cynanchum graminiforme, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are followed by follicles containing numerous small, smooth seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
