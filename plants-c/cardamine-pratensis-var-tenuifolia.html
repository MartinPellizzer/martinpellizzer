                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender water-crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
