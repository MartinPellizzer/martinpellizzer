                    <h1>Cornopteris viridifrons</h1>
<p>Cornopteris viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and rice fields. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, serrated leaflets that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
