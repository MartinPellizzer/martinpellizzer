                    <h1>Cactus</h1>
<p>Cactus, commonly known as a succulent plant, is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>These stems are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cacti belong to the family Cactaceae and are native to the Americas, with over 1,500 species found primarily in desert regions. Their flowers, which can be colorful and showy, typically bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Many cacti also have modified leaves that are reduced to spines, further adapting them to their harsh, dry habitats.</p>
