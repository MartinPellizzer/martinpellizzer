<p>Commiphora namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian myrrh tree, is a small shrub or tree native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
