                    <h1>Catasetum cernuum var. revolutum</h1>
<p>Catasetum cernuum var. revolutum, commonly known as the rolling lip orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive rolled lip. The plant produces a unique structure called a "catasetum," which is a specialized pollination mechanism involving a pollinia that adheres to the pollinator. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and fascinating reproductive biology.</p>
