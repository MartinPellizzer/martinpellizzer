<p>Caladeniastrum reptans, commonly known as the creeping caladenia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grassy areas. It has a complex root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
