                    <h1>Corynophallus afzelii var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Corynophallus afzelii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf stinkhorn, is a member of the Phallaceae family, characterized by its unique and often foul-smelling fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>This fungus is typically found in decaying organic matter, such as wood or leaf litter, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The cap of the fruiting body is initially smooth but becomes fibrous and irregular as it matures, while the stem is elongated and often curved. The spore-bearing surface is covered in a slimy, gelatinous layer that attracts flies and other insects for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and odor make it a notable, albeit sometimes unwanted, presence in fungal ecosystems.</p>
