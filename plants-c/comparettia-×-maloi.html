<p>Comparettia × maloi, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens.</p>
