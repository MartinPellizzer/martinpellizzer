                    <h1>Carduus purpureus</h1>
<p>Carduus purpureus, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its purple flowers and spiny leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in various soil types. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
