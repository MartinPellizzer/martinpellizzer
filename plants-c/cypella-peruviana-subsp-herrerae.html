<p>Cypella peruviana subsp.</p>
<p>herrerae, commonly known as the Peruvian cypella, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped heads, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections.</p>
