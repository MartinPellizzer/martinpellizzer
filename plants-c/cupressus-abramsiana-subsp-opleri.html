<p>Cupressus abramsiana subsp.</p>
<p>opleri, commonly known as the Opler's cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
