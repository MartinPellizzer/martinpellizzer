                    <h1>Conchium nervosum</h1>
<p>Conchium nervosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form a bladder-like structure to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it relies on photosynthesis for energy while supplementing its nutrient intake through captured prey.</p>
<p>The veined bladderwort is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
