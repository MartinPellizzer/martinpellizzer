<p>Cipura paludosa, commonly known as the marsh cipura, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cipura paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic insects and small vertebrates.</p>
