                    <h1>Campeiostachys calcicola</h1>
<p>Campeiostachys calcicola, commonly known as the limestone false brome, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Campeiostachys calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
