<p>Coryphantha clavata subsp.</p>
<p>clavata, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with areoles, from which both flowers and spines emerge.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its compact size and ornamental value in desert gardens.</p>
