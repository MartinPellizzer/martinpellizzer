<p>Cleistocactus laniceps, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering that covers its stems, providing insulation and protection from intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are cylindrical and often branched, forming compact clusters that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus laniceps is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually striking cactus.</p>
