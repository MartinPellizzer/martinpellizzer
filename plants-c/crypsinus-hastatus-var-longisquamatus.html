                    <h1>Crypsinus hastatus var. longisquamatus</h1>
<p>Crypsinus hastatus var. longisquamatus, commonly known as the long-squamate crypton, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often brightly colored leaves that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are showy, with tubular corollas that open into five lobes, and they are usually borne on short, erect inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
