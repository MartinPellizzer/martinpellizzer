                    <h1>Condea trichopes</h1>
<p>Condea trichopes, commonly known as the woolly condea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of soft, hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Condea trichopes thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
