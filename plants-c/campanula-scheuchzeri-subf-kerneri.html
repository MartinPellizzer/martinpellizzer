<p>Campanula scheuchzeri subf.</p>
<p>kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
