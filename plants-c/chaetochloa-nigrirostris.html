                    <h1>Chaetochloa nigrirostris</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa nigrirostris, commonly known as the black-beaked hairgrass, is a species of grass native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
