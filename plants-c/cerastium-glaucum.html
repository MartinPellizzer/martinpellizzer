<p>Cerastium glaucum, commonly known as the silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Cerastium glaucum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
