                    <h1>Calliandropsis nervosa</h1>
<p>Calliandropsis nervosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it typically grows on the branches of host trees such as dipterocars. The plant has small, opposite leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and it produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specialized habitat, Calliandropsis nervosa is relatively rare and of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions.</p>
