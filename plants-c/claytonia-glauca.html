                    <h1>Claytonia glauca</h1>
<p>Claytonia glauca, commonly known as Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, dry environments.</p>
