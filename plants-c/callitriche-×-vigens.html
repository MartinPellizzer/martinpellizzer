                    <h1>Callitriche × vigens</h1>
<p>Callitriche × vigens, commonly known as the hybrid water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Callitriche spp. and *Vignea* (though the latter is not a recognized genus in modern taxonomy, suggesting a possible taxonomic confusion). The plant typically has small, floating or submerged leaves that are oval to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
