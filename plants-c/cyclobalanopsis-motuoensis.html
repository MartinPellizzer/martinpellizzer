<p>Cyclobalanopsis motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley in China.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its thick, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy. The leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
