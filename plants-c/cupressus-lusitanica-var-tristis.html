                    <h1>Cupressus lusitanica var. tristis</h1>
<p>Cupressus lusitanica var. tristis, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
