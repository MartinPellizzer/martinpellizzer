                    <h1>Crepidium koordersii var. celebense</h1>
<p>Crepidium koordersii var. celebense, commonly known as the Celebes bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and is typically found in swampy or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy sheath that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
