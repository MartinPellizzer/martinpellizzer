                    <h1>Cereus pentalophus</h1>
<p>Cereus pentalophus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a striking cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom once a year, creating a dramatic and ephemeral display in the night.</p>
