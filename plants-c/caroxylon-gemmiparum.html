                    <h1>Caroxylon gemmiparum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon gemmiparum, commonly known as the gemmiparous caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to reproduce through vegetative propagation, specifically through the formation of gemmae, which are small, asexual propagules. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth, dark bark and small, clustered leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Caroxylon gemmiparum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
