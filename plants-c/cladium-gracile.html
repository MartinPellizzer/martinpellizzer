                    <h1>Cladium gracile</h1>
<p>Cladium gracile, commonly known as slender sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that contribute to the structure of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Cladium gracile plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
