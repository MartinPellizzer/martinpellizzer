                    <h1>Coronilla coronata f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Coronilla coronata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
