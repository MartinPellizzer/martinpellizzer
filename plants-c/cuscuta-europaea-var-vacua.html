                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. vacua</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. vacua, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host with a dense network of yellowish stems. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to attach to a variety of host species, including crops and wild plants. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it can be found in a range of habitats, including gardens and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, making it a concern in horticulture and agriculture.</p>
