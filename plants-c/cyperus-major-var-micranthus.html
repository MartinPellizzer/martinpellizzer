                    <h1>Cyperus major var. micranthus</h1>
<p>Cyperus major var. micranthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
