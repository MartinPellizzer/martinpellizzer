<p>Campderia tubiflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Campderia tubiflora is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
