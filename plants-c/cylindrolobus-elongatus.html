                    <h1>Cylindrolobus elongatus</h1>
<p>Cylindrolobus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated cylinder lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crustose thallus that forms a dark, leathery coating on rock surfaces. The lichen's vegetative body is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree trunks and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
