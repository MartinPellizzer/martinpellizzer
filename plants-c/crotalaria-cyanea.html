                    <h1>Crotalaria cyanea</h1>
<p>Crotalaria cyanea, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces elliptical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
