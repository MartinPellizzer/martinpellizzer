<p>Cuscuta cristata, commonly known as the cristate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including open fields and woodland edges. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to infest a wide range of plants.</p>
<p>Cuscuta cristata plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
