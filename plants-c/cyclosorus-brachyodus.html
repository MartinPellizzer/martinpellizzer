<p>Cyclosorus brachyodus, commonly known as the small-leaf water shield, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant's spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus brachyodus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
