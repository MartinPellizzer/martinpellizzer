                    <h1>Cryptandra miliaris var. lasiophylla</h1>
<p>Cryptandra miliaris var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the woolly cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
