                    <h1>Cypripedium hirsutum f. album</h1>
<p>Cypripedium hirsutum f. album, commonly known as the white hirsute lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
