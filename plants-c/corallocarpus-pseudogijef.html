<p>Corallocarpus pseudogijef, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name.

Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized spore capsules, which are protected by a thick, waxy layer.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Corallocarpus pseudogijef remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
