                    <h1>Clidemia raddiana</h1>
<p>Clidemia raddiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
