<p>Cerasus montana, commonly known as the mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tart red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Cerasus montana is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate colder climates.</p>
