<p>Claoxylon putii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Claoxylon putii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and overharvesting.</p>
