                    <h1>Cinchona pubescens var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Cinchona pubescens var. hirsuta, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and red or orange berries. It is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria.</p>
<p>Its cultivation has declined due to habitat loss and the reduced demand for quinine in modern medicine.</p>
