                    <h1>Cardamine demissa</h1>
<p>Cardamine demissa, commonly known as slender water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wet soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps it float. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces elongated, spiral-shaped fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Cardamine demissa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
