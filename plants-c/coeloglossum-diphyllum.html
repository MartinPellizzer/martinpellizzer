                    <h1>Coeloglossum diphyllum</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct types of leavesâ€”one for photosynthesis and another for water storage. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
