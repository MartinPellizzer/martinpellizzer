<p>Cypripedium × dallemagnei, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with other orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
