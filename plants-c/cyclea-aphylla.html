                    <h1>Cyclea aphylla</h1>
<p>Cyclea aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing near water sources.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of foliage, Cyclea aphylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
