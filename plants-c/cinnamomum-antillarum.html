<p>Cinnamomum antillarum, commonly known as the Bahamian cinnamon or West Indian cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that lead to dark, berry-like fruits. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its bark and leaves, giving it a distinctive spicy aroma similar to true cinnamon. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental and aromatic qualities, it is cultivated in tropical regions for both commercial and horticultural purposes.</p>
