                    <h1>Choristea spinosa</h1>
<p>Choristea spinosa, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It has a root system that anchors it to the substrate, and its stems are often submerged.</p>
<p>Choristea spinosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped prey for additional nutrients in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
