<p>Cyrtochilum baldeviamae, commonly known as the Baldeviamae orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
