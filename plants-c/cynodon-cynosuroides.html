                    <h1>Cynodon cynosuroides</h1>
<p>Cynodon cynosuroides, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy shores, playing a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in coastal landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
