                    <h1>Caralluma burchardii var. sventenii</h1>
<p>Caralluma burchardii var. sventenii, commonly known as the Indian figleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with fleshy, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardening.</p>
