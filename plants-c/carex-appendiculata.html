<p>Carex appendiculata, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex appendiculata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
