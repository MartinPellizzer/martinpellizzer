                    <h1>Cyperus piceus f. densior</h1>
<p>Cyperus piceus f. densior, commonly known as the dense flat sedge, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
