                    <h1>Cypripedium reginae var. album</h1>
<p>Cypripedium reginae var. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic bogs and marshes, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many areas.</p>
