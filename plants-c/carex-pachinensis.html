                    <h1>Carex pachinensis</h1>
<p>Carex pachinensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, with a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex pachinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
