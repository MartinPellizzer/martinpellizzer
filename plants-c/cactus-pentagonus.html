                    <h1>Cactus pentagonus</h1>
<p>Cactus pentagonus, commonly known as the five-angle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, ribbed stems that form a pentagonal shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The cactus also has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
