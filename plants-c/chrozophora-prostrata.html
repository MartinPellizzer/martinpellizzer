                    <h1>Chrozophora prostrata</h1>
<p>Chrozophora prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling, mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow, succulent, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Chrozophora prostrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
