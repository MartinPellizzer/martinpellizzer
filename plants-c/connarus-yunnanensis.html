                    <h1>Connarus yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Connarus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan connarus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Connarus yunnanensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
