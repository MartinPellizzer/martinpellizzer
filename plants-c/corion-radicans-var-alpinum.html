                    <h1>Corion radicans var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Corion radicans var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine trailing corion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly terrain. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
