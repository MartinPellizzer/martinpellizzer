<p>Cenchrus setaceus subsp.</p>
<p>morronei, commonly known as the Morrone's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens.</p>
