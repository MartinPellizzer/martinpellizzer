                    <h1>Chrysophyllum sessilifolium</h1>
<p>Chrysophyllum sessilifolium, commonly known as the little-leaf star-apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, sweet-smelling fruits with a smooth, yellowish skin.</p>
<p>The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, white pulp, and it is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies.</p>
