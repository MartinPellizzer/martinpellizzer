<p>Conyza sinuata, commonly known as the slender blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Conyza sinuata is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species.</p>
