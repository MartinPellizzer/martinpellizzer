<p>Copernicia oxycalyx, commonly known as the wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into clustered fruit, each containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves.</p>
<p>Copernicia oxycalyx thrives in humid, tropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
