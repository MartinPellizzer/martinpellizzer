<p>Cynoglossum spelaeum, commonly known as the cave bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in pale blue or violet hues. The plant thrives in dark, humid conditions, often found in limestone caves and rock crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to retain moisture in its challenging habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
