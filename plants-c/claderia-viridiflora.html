<p>Claderia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered claderia, is a unique species belonging to the family Claderiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, foliage-like structure that resembles a cluster of leaves, often mistaken for a moss or lichen. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
