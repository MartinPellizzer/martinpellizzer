                    <h1>Cyperus arechavaletae</h1>
<p>Cyperus arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
