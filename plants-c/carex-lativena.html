                    <h1>Carex lativena</h1>
<p>Carex lativena, commonly known as the native sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Carex lativena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
