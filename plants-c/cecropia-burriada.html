                    <h1>Cecropia burriada</h1>
<p>Cecropia burriada, commonly known as the Burriada Cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings due to its rapid growth rate. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its association with certain ant species, which live in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
