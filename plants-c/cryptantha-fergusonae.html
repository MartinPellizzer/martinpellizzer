<p>Cryptantha fergusonae, commonly known as Ferguson's bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, blue or purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cryptantha fergusonae is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and foothill regions.</p>
