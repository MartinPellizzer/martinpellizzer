                    <h1>Chiropetalum phalacradenium</h1>
<p>Chiropetalum phalacradenium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a short, stocky stem and produces a single, showy flower with elongated petals and a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
