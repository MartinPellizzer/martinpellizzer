                    <h1>Cuscuta schlechteri</h1>
<p>Cuscuta schlechteri, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to regions in Asia and is often found growing on various host species such as grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
