<p>Critonia lozanoana, commonly known as the Lozano's critonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Critonia lozanoana is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
