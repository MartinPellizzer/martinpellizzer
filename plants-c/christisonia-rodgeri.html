<p>Christisonia rodgeri, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the forests of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Christisonia rodgeri is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
