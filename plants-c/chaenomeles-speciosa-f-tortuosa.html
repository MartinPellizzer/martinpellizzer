<p>Chaenomeles speciosa f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted Japanese quince, is a compact, ornamental shrub characterized by its twisted, gnarled stems.</p>
<p>It features showy, double or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to the vibrant blossoms. This variety is prized for its unique, twisted growth habit and winter interest, with persistent red or orange fruits that add visual appeal in late autumn.</p>
<p>It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for small gardens and containers.</p>
