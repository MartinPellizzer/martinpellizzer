                    <h1>Cuscuta compacta var. compacta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta compacta var. compacta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas, where it can infest a variety of crops. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
