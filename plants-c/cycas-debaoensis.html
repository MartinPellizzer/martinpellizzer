                    <h1>Cycas debaoensis</h1>
<p>Cycas debaoensis, commonly known as the Debao cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Cycas debaoensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
