                    <h1>Cassia cytisoides</h1>
<p>Cassia cytisoides, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
