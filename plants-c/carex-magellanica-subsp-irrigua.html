<p>Carex magellanica subsp.</p>
<p>irrigua, commonly known as the Magellan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds aesthetic value to its natural habitat.</p>
