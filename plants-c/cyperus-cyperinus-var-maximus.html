                    <h1>Cyperus cyperinus var. maximus</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyperinus var. maximus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
