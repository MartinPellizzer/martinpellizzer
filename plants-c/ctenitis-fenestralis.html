                    <h1>Ctenitis fenestralis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis fenestralis, commonly known as the fenestrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth.</p>
