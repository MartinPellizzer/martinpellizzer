                    <h1>Callitris arborea</h1>
<p>Callitris arborea, commonly known as the coastal desert cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage that provides shade and habitat for various desert organisms. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its trunk. Its small, woody cones contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
