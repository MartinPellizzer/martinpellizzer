<p>Calyptrostegia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed calyptrostegia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Calyptrostegia microcephala is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
