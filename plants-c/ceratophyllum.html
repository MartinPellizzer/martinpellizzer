                    <h1>Ceratophyllum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum, commonly known as hornwort, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by its dense, branching structure and lack of true roots.</p>
<p>It is found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it provides habitat for aquatic life. The plant's leaves are feather-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ceratophyllum species are often used in aquariums due to their ability to oxygenate water and support fish populations.</p>
<p>Additionally, they play a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and reducing algae growth.</p>
