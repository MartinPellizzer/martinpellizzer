                    <h1>Cheilanthes kuhnii var. caesia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes kuhnii var. caesia, commonly known as the blue-stemmed rock fern, is a rare and specialized member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves with a bluish tint, which helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its unique coloration and is often found in rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
