<p>Cactus laetus, commonly known as the joyous cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for desert gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
