<p>Cyperus mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Cyperus mauritianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water bodies.</p>
