<p>Cousinia corymbosa, commonly known as the desert sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia corymbosa is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
