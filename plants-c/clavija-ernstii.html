<p>Clavija ernstii, commonly known as the Ernst's clavija, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clavija ernstii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
