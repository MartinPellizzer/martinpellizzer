                    <h1>Caucanthus albidus var. fimbripetalus</h1>
<p>Caucanthus albidus var. fimbripetalus, commonly known as the white caucanthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale white petals that resemble a fan shape, giving it the common name "fimbripetalus," which refers to its fringed petal edges. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
