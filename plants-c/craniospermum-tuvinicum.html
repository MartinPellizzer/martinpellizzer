<p>Craniospermum tuvinicum, commonly known as the Tuvinian skullplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Craniospermum tuvinicum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
