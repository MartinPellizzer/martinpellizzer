                    <h1>Carex vesicaria var. colorata</h1>
<p>Carex vesicaria var. colorata, commonly known as the colored burr sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that mature into distinctive, inflated, seed-bearing structures called "burr-like" capsules. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value, especially when the seed heads turn a striking red or purple color in the fall.</p>
