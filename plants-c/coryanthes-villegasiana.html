                    <h1>Coryanthes villegasiana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes villegasiana, commonly known as the "Crimson Ghost Orchid," is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically bright red or orange with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and relies on tree canopies for support. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific flies, which are attracted to the strong, unpleasant odor it emits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
