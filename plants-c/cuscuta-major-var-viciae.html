                    <h1>Cuscuta major var. viciae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta major var. viciae, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops such as soybeans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and agricultural machinery, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield and health of its host plants.</p>
