                    <h1>Cyclopogon dutrae</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cyclopogon dutrae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
