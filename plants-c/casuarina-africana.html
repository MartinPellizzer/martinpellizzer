<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, consisting of dense, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina africana is adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it a hardy species capable of thriving in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in certain regions.</p>
