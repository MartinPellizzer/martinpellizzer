<p>Crepidium mambulilingense, commonly known as the Mambuliling orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often adorned with subtle markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
