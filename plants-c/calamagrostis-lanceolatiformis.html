<p>Calamagrostis lanceolatiformis, commonly known as the narrow leaf reed, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats.</p>
