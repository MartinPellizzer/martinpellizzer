                    <h1>Calyptrostylis asperula var. minor</h1>
<p>Calyptrostylis asperula var. minor, commonly known as the small rough-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
