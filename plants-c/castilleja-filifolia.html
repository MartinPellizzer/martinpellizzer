                    <h1>Castilleja filifolia</h1>
<p>Castilleja filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Castilleja filifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
