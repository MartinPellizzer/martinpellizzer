                    <h1>Cecropia sciadophylla</h1>
<p>Cecropia sciadophylla, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to form associations with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for protection from herbivores.</p>
