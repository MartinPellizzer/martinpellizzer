<p>Calonemorchis hiemalis, commonly known as the winter orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Calonemorchis hiemalis is known for its unique ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
