<p>Celtis rigida, commonly known as the sand-laurel or hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Celtis rigida is typically found in open woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, demonstrating adaptability to a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in urban environments make it a common sight in many regions.</p>
