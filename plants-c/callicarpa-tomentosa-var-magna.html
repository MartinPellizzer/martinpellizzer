<p>Callicarpa tomentosa var. magna, commonly known as the large-fruit beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that give way to striking, violet-purple berries. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and thrives in partial to full sun. Its hairy, grayish foliage and showy fruit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
