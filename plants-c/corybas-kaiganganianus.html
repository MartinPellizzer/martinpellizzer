                    <h1>Corybas kaiganganianus</h1>
<p>Corybas kaiganganianus, commonly known as the Kaigani ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the remote Kaigani Islands in the Torres Strait.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, urn-shaped flower that lacks petals, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it blooms infrequently, making it a challenging subject for study.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and low population, it is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest.</p>
