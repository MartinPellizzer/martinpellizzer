                    <h1>Calonemorchis cleistogama</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous orchid, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closed, self-pollinating flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances seed production in less favorable environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in low-light environments. Its flowers are small and often lack showy petals, focusing instead on efficient pollination through self-fertilization.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits unique morphological adaptations that support its reproductive mode and ecological niche.</p>
