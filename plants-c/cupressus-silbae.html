                    <h1>Cupressus silbae</h1>
<p>Cupressus silbae, commonly known as the Silbae cypress, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and tall, slender trunk, which often forms a narrow, columnar shape. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of many conifer species. Its leaves are dark green and remain on the tree for several years, contributing to its evergreen nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cupressus silbae is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species.</p>
