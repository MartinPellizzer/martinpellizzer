                    <h1>Coccoloba sagotii</h1>
<p>Coccoloba sagotii, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove-like plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter sediments.</p>
<p>Coccoloba sagotii is commonly found in brackish or saline wetlands, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
