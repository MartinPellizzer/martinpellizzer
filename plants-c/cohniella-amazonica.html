                    <h1>Cohniella amazonica</h1>
<p>Cohniella amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which it relies on for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Cohniella amazonica is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
