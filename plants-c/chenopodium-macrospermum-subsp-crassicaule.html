<p>Chenopodium macrospermum subsp.</p>
<p>crassicaule, commonly known as thick-stemmed goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
