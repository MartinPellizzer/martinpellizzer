                    <h1>Chaetocyperus</h1>
<p>Chaetocyperus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist to water-saturated soils. Chaetocyperus species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like flower clusters. They often form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas.</p>
