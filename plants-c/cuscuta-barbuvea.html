                    <h1>Cuscuta barbuvea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta barbuvea, commonly known as the burr dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in hooked bracts that aid in attachment to host plants. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are small and can remain dormant in soil for extended periods, facilitating its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
