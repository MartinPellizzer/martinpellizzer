                    <h1>Chytroma urceolata</h1>
<p>Chytroma urceolata, commonly known as the cup-shaped lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the class Lecanoromycetes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like thallus, which provides a stable substrate for its symbiotic association with algae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a fungal component that envelops the algal partner, forming a composite organism.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
