                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe nivalis</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe nivalis, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, scale-like leaves that help retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for fertilization.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Crocodeilanthe nivalis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
