<p>Caralluma gracilipes subsp.</p>
<p>edwardsiae, commonly known as the "desert fig" or "tumbleweed," is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular as a decorative succulent due to its unique appearance.</p>
