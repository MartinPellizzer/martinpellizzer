<p>Conium maculatum subsp.</p>
<p>divaricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemlock, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces a highly toxic alkaloid called coniine, which makes it poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
