                <h1>Caulopsis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Caulopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered candelabra, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that form a candelabra-like structure, often adorned with sparse, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pale yellow or greenish flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation in arid environments, while its stems store water to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Caulopsis pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
