                    <h1>Caralluma vibratilis</h1>
<p>Caralluma vibratilis, commonly known as the trembling prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Caralluma vibratilis is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
