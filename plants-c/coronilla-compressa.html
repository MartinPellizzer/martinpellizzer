                    <h1>Coronilla compressa</h1>
<p>Coronilla compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
