                    <h1>Ctenodon tenuis</h1>
<p>Ctenodon tenuis, commonly known as the slender thread-plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with abundant sunlight and nutrient-rich sediment. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing in the axils of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ctenodon tenuis is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
