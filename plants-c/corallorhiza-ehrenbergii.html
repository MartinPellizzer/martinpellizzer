                    <h1>Corallorhiza ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza ehrenbergii, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant has a slender, branching stem with showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary organic compounds.</p>
<p>The species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in the understory vegetation.</p>
