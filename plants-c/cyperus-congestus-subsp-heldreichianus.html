<p>Cyperus congestus subsp.</p>
<p>heldreichianus, commonly known as the Balkan flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the margins of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
