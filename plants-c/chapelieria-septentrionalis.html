                    <h1>Chapelieria septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Chapelieria septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern Chapelier's orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single, upright spike bearing several pale pink to white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chapelieria septentrionalis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
