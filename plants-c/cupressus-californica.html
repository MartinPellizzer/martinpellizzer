                    <h1>Cupressus californica</h1>
<p>Cupressus californica, commonly known as the California redwood, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along the coast. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it can live for several hundred years in the right conditions.</p>
