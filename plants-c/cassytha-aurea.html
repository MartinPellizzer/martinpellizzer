<p>Cassytha aurea, commonly known as golden cassytha, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, yellowish hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to twine around other plants make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
