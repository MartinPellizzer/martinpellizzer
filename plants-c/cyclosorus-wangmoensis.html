                    <h1>Cyclosorus wangmoensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus wangmoensis, commonly known as the Wangmo cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant's rhizomes are slender and often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile ecosystem requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation.</p>
