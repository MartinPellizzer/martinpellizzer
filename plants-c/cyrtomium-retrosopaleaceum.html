<p>Cyrtomium retrosopaleaceum, commonly known as the paleaceum holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
