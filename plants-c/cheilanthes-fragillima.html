<p>Cheilanthes fragillima, commonly known as the fragile rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in crevices or on rock surfaces. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes fragillima plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
