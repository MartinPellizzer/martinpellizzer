                    <h1>Cyphostigma curtisii</h1>
<p>Cyphostigma curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink or white, which appear only briefly during the cooler months. Cyphostigma curtisii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
