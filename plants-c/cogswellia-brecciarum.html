                    <h1>Cogswellia brecciarum</h1>
<p>Cogswellia brecciarum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance, with elongated stems and delicate, waxy leaves. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its stem and leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
