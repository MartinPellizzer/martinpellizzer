                    <h1>Chorigyne tumescens</h1>
<p>Chorigyne tumescens, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms.</p>
<p>These bladders are specialized for capturing prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to both aquatic and carnivorous lifestyles.</p>
