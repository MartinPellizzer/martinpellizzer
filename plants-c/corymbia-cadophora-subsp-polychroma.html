<p>Corymbia cadophora subsp.</p>
<p>polychroma, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique bark and foliage.</p>
