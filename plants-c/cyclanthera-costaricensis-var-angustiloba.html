                    <h1>Cyclanthera costaricensis var. angustiloba</h1>
<p>Cyclanthera costaricensis var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourd and cucumber species. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes and produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. The fruit's bitter taste is due to the presence of cucurbitacins, which are secondary metabolites.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in traditional medicine.</p>
