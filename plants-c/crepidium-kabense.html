<p>Crepidium kabense, commonly known as the Kabense Pteridium, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
