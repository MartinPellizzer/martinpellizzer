                    <h1>Cypripedium javanicum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium javanicum, commonly known as the Java lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many countries.</p>
