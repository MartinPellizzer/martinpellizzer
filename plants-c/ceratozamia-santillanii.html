                    <h1>Ceratozamia santillanii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia santillanii, commonly known as the Santillan's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern, highlighting the need for protection of its natural habitat.</p>
