                    <h1>Chelidonium majus f. serratum</h1>
<p>Chelidonium majus f. serratum, commonly known as the serrated greater celandine, is a variant of the greater celandine plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains various alkaloids, including chelidonine, which makes it toxic and potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a notable wildflower and a plant of caution due to its poisonous properties.</p>
