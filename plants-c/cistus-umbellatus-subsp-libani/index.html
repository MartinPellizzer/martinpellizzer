                            <h1>Cistus Umbellatus Subsp. Libani</h1>
<p>Cistus umbellatus subsp. libani is a hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is known for its distinctive clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Often used in traditional medicine, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
