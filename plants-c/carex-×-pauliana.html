                    <h1>Carex × pauliana</h1>
<p>Carex × pauliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grassy leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
