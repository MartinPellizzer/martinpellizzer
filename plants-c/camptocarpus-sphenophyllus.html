                    <h1>Camptocarpus sphenophyllus</h1>
<p>Camptocarpus sphenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed camptocarpus, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Camptocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and unique reproductive structures that resemble cones. This plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky crevices or shaded forest floors, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a distinct arrangement of sporangia along the leaf margins.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Camptocarpus sphenophyllus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
