                    <h1>Carex viridula f. clandestina</h1>
<p>Carex viridula f. clandestina, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex viridula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that exhibits a distinctive dark green to almost black coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers that mature into brown, triangular seed heads.</p>
