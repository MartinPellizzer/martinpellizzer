                    <h1>Chamaefistula acuminata</h1>
<p>Chamaefistula acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its slow growth rate and ability to tolerate pruning make it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
