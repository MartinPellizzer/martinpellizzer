                    <h1>Cuscuta convallariiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta convallariiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized root-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found on plants such as morning glory and other members of the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and survival of its host, making it an important ecological component in certain ecosystems.</p>
