                    <h1>Calamus palustris var. amplissimus</h1>
<p>Calamus palustris var. amplissimus, commonly known as swamp calamus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, slender rhizomes that grow horizontally beneath the soil, supporting its tall, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in moist habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other calamus species and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
