<p>Clematis nannophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Its twining stems allow it to climb and spread along trellises or structures.</p>
<p>Clematis nannophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
