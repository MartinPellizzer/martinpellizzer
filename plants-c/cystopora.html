                    <h1>Cystopora</h1>
<p>Cystopora, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Cystoporidae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Cystopora species typically grow in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plants have a simple morphology, with leaf-like structures that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
