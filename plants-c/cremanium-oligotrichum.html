<p>Cremanium oligotrichum, commonly known as the slender cremanium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>

Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
