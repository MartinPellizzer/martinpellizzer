                    <h1>Cenchrus monostigma</h1>
<p>Cenchrus monostigma, commonly known as the burr grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense growth habit and the presence of spiny, awned lemmas on its inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread readily, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its adaptability and resilience in arid environments.</p>
