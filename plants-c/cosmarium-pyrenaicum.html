                    <h1>Cosmarium pyrenaicum</h1>
<p>Cosmarium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean Cosmarium, is a freshwater green alga belonging to the family Cosmariaceae.</p>
<p>It is typically found in oligotrophic lakes and ponds, where it forms dense, gelatinous colonies on submerged surfaces. The plant is characterized by its branching, filamentous structure and the presence of flagellated zoospores for dispersal. Its microscopic morphology includes a distinctive arrangement of chloroplasts and pyrenoids, which are essential for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Cosmarium pyrenaicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for small invertebrates.</p>
