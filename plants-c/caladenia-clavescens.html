<p>Caladenia clavescens, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions, often in open woodlands or heathlands. It produces its flowers during the spring and early summer months, and its growth is often associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
