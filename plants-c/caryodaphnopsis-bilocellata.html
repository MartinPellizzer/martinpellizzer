<p>Caryodaphnopsis bilocellata, commonly known as the two-celled nut tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its unique two-cell structure in its fruit. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, spiny leaves and acorn-like nuts. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant evolution and biodiversity.</p>
