<p>Carex extensa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, adapted to thrive in saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers during the summer months. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist conditions, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
