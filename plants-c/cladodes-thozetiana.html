                    <h1>Cladodes thozetiana</h1>
<p>Cladodes thozetiana, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical cladodes that resemble candles, which are modified stems used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it highly adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The cladodes are often covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
