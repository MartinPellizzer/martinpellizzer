<p>Chaptalia petrophila, commonly known as the rock chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on steep slopes and cliffs. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Chaptalia petrophila is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
