                <h1>Carex stricta</h1>
<p>Carex stricta, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, upright clumps, forming tussocks that help stabilize soil. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saturated or seasonally flooded soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex stricta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife.</p>
