                    <h1>Crozophyla elliptica</h1>
<p>Crozophyla elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Crozophyla elliptica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
