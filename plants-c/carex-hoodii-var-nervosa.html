<p>Carex hoodii var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes consist of small, spikelet-like structures that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The varietal form, nervosa, is distinguished by its finely veined leaves and subtle differences in morphology compared to the typical Carex hoodii.</p>
