                    <h1>Cochlearia pusilla</h1>
<p>Cochlearia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sea kale, is a small flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Cochlearia pusilla is adapted to survive in harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient and unique species.</p>
