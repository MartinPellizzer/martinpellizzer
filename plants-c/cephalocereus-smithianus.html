<p>Cephalocereus smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, spiny stem and clusters of white flowers that bloom at the ends of the stems. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help shade the stem, reducing heat stress.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to produce edible fruits, which are small, red, and sweet.</p>
