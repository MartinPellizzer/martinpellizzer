<p>Catapodium hemipoa, commonly known as the narrowleaf catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in low, dense tufts, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
