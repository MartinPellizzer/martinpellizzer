<p>Cochemiea saboae subsp.</p>
<p>goldii, commonly known as the Goldii Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters, featuring a compact, globular shape with a greenish-gray coloration.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short peduncles. Its leaves are modified into tubercles, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water from the soil surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
