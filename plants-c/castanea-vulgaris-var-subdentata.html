                    <h1>Castanea vulgaris var. subdentata</h1>
<p>Castanea vulgaris var. subdentata, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing one or two chestnuts, which are edible after the hard shell is removed. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The subspecies subdentata is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties of the genus Castanea.</p>
