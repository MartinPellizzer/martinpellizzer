<p>Conyza prolifera, commonly known as the common horseweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Conyza prolifera is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
