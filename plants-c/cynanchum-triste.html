                    <h1>Cynanchum triste</h1>
<p>Cynanchum triste, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds with a silky appendage that aids in wind dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in natural habitats.</p>
