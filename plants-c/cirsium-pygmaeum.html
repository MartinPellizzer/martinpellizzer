                    <h1>Cirsium pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Cirsium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Cirsium pygmaeum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
