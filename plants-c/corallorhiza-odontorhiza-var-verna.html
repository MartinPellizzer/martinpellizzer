                    <h1>Corallorhiza odontorhiza var. verna</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza odontorhiza var. verna, commonly known as the spring coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
