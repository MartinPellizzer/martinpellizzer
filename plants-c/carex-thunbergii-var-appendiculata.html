<p>Carex thunbergii var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
