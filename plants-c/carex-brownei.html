                    <h1>Carex brownei</h1>
<p>Carex brownei, commonly known as Brown's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetlands and moist woodland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Carex brownei is typically found in shaded, damp environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
