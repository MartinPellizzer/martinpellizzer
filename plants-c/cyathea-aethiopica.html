                    <h1>Cyathea aethiopica</h1>
<p>Cyathea aethiopica, commonly known as the African tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Cyathea aethiopica typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing cones are clustered at the top of the trunk, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
