<p>Caucalis hordeicarpa, commonly known as the barley bur, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into spiny, seed-containing burs. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are often dispersed by animals due to the hooked structures on the burs.</p>
<p>Caucalis hordeicarpa is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
