                    <h1>Cuscuta leiolepis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta leiolepis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless branches. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants, including grasses and forbs.</p>
<p>Cuscuta leiolepis is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
