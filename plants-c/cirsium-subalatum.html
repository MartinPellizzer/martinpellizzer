                    <h1>Cirsium subalatum</h1>
<p>Cirsium subalatum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Cirsium subalatum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
