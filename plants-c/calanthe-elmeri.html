                    <h1>Calanthe elmeri</h1>
<p>Calanthe elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features a compact, sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe elmeri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
