                    <h1>Circaea cordata var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Circaea cordata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, upright stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it a slightly sticky texture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, contributing to its common name.</p>
