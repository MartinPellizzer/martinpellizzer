                    <h1>Cordia crenatifolia</h1>
<p>Cordia crenatifolia, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The tree is notable for its lightweight, porous wood, which has been historically used for model-making and other lightweight applications.</p>
