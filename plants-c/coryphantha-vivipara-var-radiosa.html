                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. radiosa</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. radiosa, commonly known as the Radiosa Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its unique feature is the presence of vivipary, where the plant gives birth to offspring that are already partially developed on the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
