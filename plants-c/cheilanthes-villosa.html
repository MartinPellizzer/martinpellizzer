<p>Cheilanthes villosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes villosa is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry climates.</p>
