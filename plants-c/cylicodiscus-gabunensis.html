<p>Cylicodiscus gabunensis, commonly known as the Gabon cycad, is a species of cycad native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
