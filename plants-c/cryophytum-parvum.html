                    <h1>Cryophytum parvum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum parvum, commonly known as the dwarf snow plant, is a rare alpine species native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adapted to the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Cryophytum parvum is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs adapted to acidic and rocky soils.</p>
