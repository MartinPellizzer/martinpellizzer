                    <h1>Caryota rumphiana var. alberti</h1>
<p>Caryota rumphiana var. alberti, commonly known as the Albert's fishtail palm, is a variant of the fishtail palm native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided, feather-like leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by spiny, round fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>The varietal form alberti is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Caryota rumphiana.</p>
