<p>Cleistocactus acanthurus subsp.</p>
<p>canetensis, commonly known as the Canary Island cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are typically brown or reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections.</p>
