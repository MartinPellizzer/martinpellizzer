<p>Calligonum aphyllum subsp.</p>
<p>heptapotamicum, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its sparse, often deciduous foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area, minimizing water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
