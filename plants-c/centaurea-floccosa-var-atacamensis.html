<p>Centaurea floccosa var. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama cottonthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh desert environments.</p>
