                    <h1>Cypholophus melanocarpus</h1>
<p>Cypholophus melanocarpus, commonly known as the black-fruited cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones bearing yellowish pollen sacs and the female cones developing into dark, leathery fruits. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
