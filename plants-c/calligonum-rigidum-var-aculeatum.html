                    <h1>Calligonum rigidum var. aculeatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum rigidum var. aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and reclaiming degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
