<p>Carpobrotus mellei, commonly known as the yellow fig, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, sprawling stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fleshy, edible berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
