<p>Convolvulus cantabrica var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or lilac in color. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and persistent nature make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
