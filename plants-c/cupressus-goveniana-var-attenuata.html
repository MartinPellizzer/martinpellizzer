                    <h1>Cupressus goveniana var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Cupressus goveniana var. attenuata, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that turn a striking coppery-red in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round color and ability to provide privacy in landscaping.</p>
