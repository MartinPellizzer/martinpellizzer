<p>Coccinia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant cucumber or large-flowered ivy gourd, is a tropical vine native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cucumbers but are typically smaller and more rounded. Coccinia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates.</p>
