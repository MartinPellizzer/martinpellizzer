                    <h1>Cyclobalanus daphnoidea</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanus daphnoidea, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic species native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces buoyant, fibrous fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Cyclobalanus daphnoidea plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
