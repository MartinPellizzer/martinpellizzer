                    <h1>Corymbia karelgica</h1>
<p>Corymbia karelgica, commonly known as the Karelia bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Corymbia karelgica is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional and contemporary crafts.</p>
