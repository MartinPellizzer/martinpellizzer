                    <h1>Cyrtogonium costatum</h1>
<p>Cyrtogonium costatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment while its fronds float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Cyrtogonium costatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
