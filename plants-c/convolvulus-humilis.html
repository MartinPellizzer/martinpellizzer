                    <h1>Convolvulus humilis</h1>
<p>Convolvulus humilis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a weed and a valuable forage plant in some regions.</p>
