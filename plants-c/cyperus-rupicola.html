<p>Cyperus rupicola, commonly known as rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus rupicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
