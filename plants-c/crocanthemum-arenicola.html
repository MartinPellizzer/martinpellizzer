                    <h1>Crocanthemum arenicola</h1>
<p>Crocanthemum arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, often blue or purple, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Crocanthemum arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
