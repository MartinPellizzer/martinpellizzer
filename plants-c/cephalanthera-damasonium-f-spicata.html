                    <h1>Cephalanthera damasonium f. spicata</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera damasonium f. spicata, commonly known as the spicate early purple orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
