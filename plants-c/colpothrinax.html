                    <h1>Colpothrinax</h1>
<p>Colpothrinax, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>These palms are native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. They are characterized by their tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves that resemble a windmill when in motion. Colpothrinax species typically thrive in coastal and limestone areas due to their ability to tolerate saline and alkaline soils.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are often grown in warm, humid climates.</p>
