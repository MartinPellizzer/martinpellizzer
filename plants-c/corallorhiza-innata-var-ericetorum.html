                    <h1>Corallorhiza innata var. ericetorum</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza innata var. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a parasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It typically grows in acidic, forested environments where it attaches to the roots of ericaceous shrubs such as heather. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its morphology includes a slender, branched stem and reduced leaves, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is often found in moist, shaded areas of temperate regions.</p>
