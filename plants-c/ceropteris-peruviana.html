                    <h1>Ceropteris peruviana</h1>
<p>Ceropteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ceropteris peruviana is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
