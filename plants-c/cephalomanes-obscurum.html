<p>Cephalomanes obscurum, commonly known as the dark-headed mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Erythraeidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval body and a dark, almost black head region, which gives it its common name. This species is typically found in moist environments, such as under leaf litter or in soil, where it plays a role in decomposition. Its life cycle includes several stages, with the adult female being the most commonly observed.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic nature and limited study, much about its ecological role and distribution remains unknown.</p>
