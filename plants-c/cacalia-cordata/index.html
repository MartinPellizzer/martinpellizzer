<p>Cacalia cordata is a delicate flowering plant known for its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This species is often found in shaded woodlands and rocky slopes where it spreads via rhizomes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a touch of wild beauty.
