<p>Cyperus esculentus var. heermannii, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small spines. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along waterways.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic environments due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
