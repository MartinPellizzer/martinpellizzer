<p>Calamagrostis arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially in full sun.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
