<p>Cirsium chlorolepis, commonly known as the greenleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of prickly bracts, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cirsium chlorolepis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
