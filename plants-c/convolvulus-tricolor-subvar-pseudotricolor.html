                    <h1>Convolvulus tricolor subvar. pseudotricolor</h1>
<p>Convolvulus tricolor subvar. pseudotricolor, commonly known as the three-color morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that display three distinct colorsâ€”typically red, yellow, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as a climbing or trailing vine. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The subspecies pseudotricolor is distinguished by its more pronounced color separation compared to the typical Convolvulus tricolor.</p>
