                    <h1>Cyclosorus macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often forming a rosette that floats on the water surface. It is native to freshwater environments in Asia, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in the substrate and spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
