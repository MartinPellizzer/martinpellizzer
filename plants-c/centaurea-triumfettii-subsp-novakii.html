<p>Centaurea triumfettii subsp.</p>
<p>novakii, commonly known as the Novak's cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
