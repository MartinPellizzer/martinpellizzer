                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis f. arctica</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis f. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and is a valuable component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
