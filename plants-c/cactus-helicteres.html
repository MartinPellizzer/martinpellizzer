                    <h1>Cactus helicteres</h1>
<p>Cactus helicteres, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, facilitating its dispersal in suitable habitats.</p>
