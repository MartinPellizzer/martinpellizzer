                    <h1>Callicarpa longifolia var. lanceolaria</h1>
<p>Callicarpa longifolia var. lanceolaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by vibrant purple to red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their tart flavor.</p>
<p>The species is valued in gardens for its ornamental berries and autumn foliage.</p>
