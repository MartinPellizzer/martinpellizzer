<p>Crepidium andersonii subsp.</p>
<p>andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and bogs of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, poorly drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
