                    <h1>Crassula scabrella</h1>
<p>Crassula scabrella, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.</p>
<p>Crassula scabrella is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
