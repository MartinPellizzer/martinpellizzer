<p>Calystegia subacaulis subsp.</p>
<p>subacaulis, commonly known as the slender bindweed, is a climbing vine native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive purple throat.</p>
<p>The plant has a weak, sprawling growth habit and often thrives in disturbed soils along roadsides and in fields. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
