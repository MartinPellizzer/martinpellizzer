                    <h1>Caesalpinia bahamensis</h1>
<p>Caesalpinia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange inflorescences that resemble small torches, which are highly visible and attract pollinators. The plant has pinnate leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>
