                    <h1>Conopharyngia retusa</h1>
<p>Conopharyngia retusa, commonly known as the straight pharynx plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Conopharyngia genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces distinctive, spiky flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shades of pale yellow to green. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolutionary biology.</p>
