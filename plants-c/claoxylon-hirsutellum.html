<p>Claoxylon hirsutellum, commonly known as the hirsute tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in wet, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making.</p>
