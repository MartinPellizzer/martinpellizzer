                            <h1>Carex Caryophyllea Var. Cuspidata</h1>
<p>Cuspidate sedge, scientifically known as Carex caryophyllea var. cuspidata, is a striking member of the Cyperaceae family that thrives in moist, well-drained environments. With its distinctive, spiky inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves, this plant adds unique texture to wetland and bog ecosystems. Native to parts of North America, it is often found in marshy areas and along stream banks where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants that blend beauty with ecological function. Despite its modest size, the Cuspidate sedge contributes significantly to the health and diversity of wetland habitats.</p>
