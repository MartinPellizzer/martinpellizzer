                    <h1>Calamagrostis freticola</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis freticola, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the moist, acidic habitats of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, especially at the base. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding subtle ornamental value to its natural setting. It thrives in wet meadows, bogs, and heaths, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable moisture conditions.</p>
