<p>Centrolepis cephaloformis subsp.</p>
<p>cephaloformis, commonly known as the coastal centrolepis, is a unique monocot native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, compact rosette growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
