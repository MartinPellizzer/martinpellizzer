<p>Corydalis crispa subsp.</p>
<p>crispa, commonly known as the narrowleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
