<p>Calycomelia epiptera, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Calycomelia epiptera is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy environments.</p>
