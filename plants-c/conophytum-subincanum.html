<p>Conophytum subincanum, commonly known as the "Cape Mallow," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and succulent collections.</p>
