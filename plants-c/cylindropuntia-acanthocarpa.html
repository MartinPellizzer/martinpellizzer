                <h1>Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa, commonly known as the cholla cactus, is a spineless, columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features multiple cylindrical stems that branch out to form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
