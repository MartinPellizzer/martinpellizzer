<p>Cereus calcirupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its stems are often ribbed and can store water, while its flowers are large and white, typically blooming at night. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
