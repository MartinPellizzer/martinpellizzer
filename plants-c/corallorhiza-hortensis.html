                    <h1>Corallorhiza hortensis</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza hortensis, commonly known as the garden coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with various mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
