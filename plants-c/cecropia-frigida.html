                    <h1>Cecropia frigida</h1>
<p>Cecropia frigida, commonly known as the cold cecropia, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Cecropia frigida is relatively rare and has specific ecological roles in its native ecosystem.</p>
