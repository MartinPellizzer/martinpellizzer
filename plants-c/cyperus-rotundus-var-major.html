                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. major</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. major, commonly known as nutgrass, is a perennial grassy plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant produces small, three-lobed, yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Nutgrass is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its persistent and invasive nature.</p>
