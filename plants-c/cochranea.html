                    <h1>Cochranea</h1>
<p>Cochranea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowers bloom in spring and are followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Cochranea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
