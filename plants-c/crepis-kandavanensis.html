<p>Crepis kandavanensis, commonly known as the Kandavan hairgrass, is a rare and endemic species native to the alpine regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
