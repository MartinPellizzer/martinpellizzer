                    <h1>Cypripedium cardiophyllum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heart-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a heart-shaped pouch, which is a distinctive feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its common name, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
