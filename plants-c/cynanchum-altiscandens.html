                    <h1>Cynanchum altiscandens</h1>
<p>Cynanchum altiscandens, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a perennial vine native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that twine around supports and produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and emits a milky sap when damaged. Its flowers give way to elliptical, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Cynanchum altiscandens is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
