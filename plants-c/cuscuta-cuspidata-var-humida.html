                    <h1>Cuscuta cuspidata var. humida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cuspidata var. humida, commonly known as the sticky nightshade dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found parasitizing plants in the nightshade family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
