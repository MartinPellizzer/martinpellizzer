<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are thick, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two upper lips and three lower lips, and come in shades of pink to red.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
