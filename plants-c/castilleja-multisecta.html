<p>Castilleja multisecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its root system to absorb water and nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Castilleja multisecta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
