<p>Clinopodium vimineum, commonly known as creeping mint or field mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a strong mint-like aroma when crushed.</p>
<p>Clinopodium vimineum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks.</p>
