                    <h1>Cyperus panamensis var. deformis</h1>
<p>Cyperus panamensis var. deformis, commonly known as the Panamanian flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly deformed or irregular leaf morphology compared to other Cyperus species.</p>
