<p>Cephalophyllum calvinianum, commonly known as the Calvins' head plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its botanical classification places it within the family Aizoaceae, which includes many desert and semi-desert species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cephalophyllum calvinianum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
