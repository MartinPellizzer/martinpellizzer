<p>Carelia agrianthus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Carelia agrianthus is now considered an endangered species.</p>
