                            <h1>Cnidoscolus Vitifolius</h1>
<p>Cnidoscolus vitifolius is a striking tropical plant known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and unique spiny structures. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, warm climates with plenty of sunlight. The plant's name comes from the Greek words for "spine" and "leaf," reflecting its distinctive features. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its bold appearance and ability to attract wildlife. Despite its beauty, it can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care.</p>
