                    <h1>Cladium junceum var. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Cladium junceum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in shallow, freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
