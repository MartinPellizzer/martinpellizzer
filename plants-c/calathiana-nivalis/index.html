                            <h1>Calathiana Nivalis</h1>
<p>Calathiana nivalis is a rare and delicate flowering plant known for its striking white blooms. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine regions where the climate is cold and harsh. This species is native to specific areas in the Andes, where it has adapted to extreme conditions. Its flowers bloom briefly during the summer months, making it a fleeting yet beautiful sight. Due to its limited habitat, Calathiana nivalis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and human activity.</p>
