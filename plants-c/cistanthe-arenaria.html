<p>Cistanthe arenaria, commonly known as the sand cistanthe, is a low-growing, perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cistanthe arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
