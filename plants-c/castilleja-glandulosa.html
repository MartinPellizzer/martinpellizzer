                    <h1>Castilleja glandulosa</h1>
<p>Castilleja glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific host species, often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Castilleja glandulosa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
