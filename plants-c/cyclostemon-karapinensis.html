                    <h1>Cyclostemon karapinensis</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon karapinensis, commonly known as the Karapin's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer, and it produces large, palm-like leaves that are typically green and glossy. Cyclostemon karapinensis is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it reproduces through cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
