                    <h1>Carex curvula f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Carex curvula f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to wet or moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly curled appearance at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
