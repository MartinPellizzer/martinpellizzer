<p>Coincya monensis subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to its aquatic habitat, though it is considered rare and endangered in its native range.</p>
