                    <h1>Carex vallis-rosetto var. heterostachya</h1>
<p>Carex vallis-rosetto var. heterostachya, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle inflorescence.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its variability in stamen length, which contributes to its specific epithet "heterostachya.".</p>
