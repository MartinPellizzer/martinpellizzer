                <h1>Carterella alexanderae</h1>
<p>Carterella alexanderae, commonly known as the Alexander's cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a globular, spiny stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carterella alexanderae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
