                    <h1>Cuscuta gussonii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gussonii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various flowering plants such as sunflowers and thistles. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds dispersing through the wind or by attaching to new hosts.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
