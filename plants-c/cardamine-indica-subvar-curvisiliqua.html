                    <h1>Cardamine indica subvar. curvisiliqua</h1>
<p>Cardamine indica subvar. curvisiliqua, commonly known as the curly-stemmed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of streams and ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species.</p>
