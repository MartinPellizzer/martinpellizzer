<p>Cerbera micrantha, commonly known as the poison apple or white coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are highly toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a hazardous plant due to its toxic properties.</p>
