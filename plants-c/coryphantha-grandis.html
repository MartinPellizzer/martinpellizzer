                    <h1>Coryphantha grandis</h1>
<p>Coryphantha grandis, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its spiny, areolate structure provides protection against herbivores and helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coryphantha grandis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
