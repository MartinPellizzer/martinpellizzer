                    <h1>Convolvulus cespitosus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus cespitosus, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
