                    <h1>Cycas multiovula</h1>
<p>Cycas multiovula, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with both male and female cones occurring on the same plant, making it monoecious. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable species in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
