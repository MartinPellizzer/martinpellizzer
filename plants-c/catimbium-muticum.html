<p>Catimbium muticum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is non-native.</p>
