                    <h1>Cardaminopsis cebennensis</h1>
<p>Cardaminopsis cebennensis, commonly known as the Cevennese watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the limestone-rich regions of the CÃ©vennes mountains in southern France.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, serrated edge, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is closely related to other members of the Roridulaceae family, which are known for their unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
