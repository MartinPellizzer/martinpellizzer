<p>Cladium schoenoides var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a sharp, saw-toothed edge. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is often found in marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to flooded conditions and plays a vital role in the ecological balance of wetland environments.</p>
