                    <h1>Corynopuntia agglomerata</h1>
<p>Corynopuntia agglomerata, commonly known as the clustered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Corynopuntia agglomerata is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
