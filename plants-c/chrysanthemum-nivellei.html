<p>Chrysanthemum nivellei, commonly known as the snow chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
