                    <h1>Cyclosorus gongshanensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan cyclosorus, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
