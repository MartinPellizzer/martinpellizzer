                    <h1>Cladium australe</h1>
<p>Cladium australe, commonly known as the Australian sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Cladium australe thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps in preventing erosion and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
