<p>Cyclophyllum subulatum, commonly known as the slender cyclophyllum, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces cones, which are the reproductive structures of cycads, consisting of both male and female parts. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclophyllum subulatum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
