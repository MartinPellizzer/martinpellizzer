                    <h1>Carronia protensa</h1>
<p>Carronia protensa, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Carronia protensa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
