                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. exul</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. exul, commonly known as the exiled lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or purple hue. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem, often with intricate patterns on its petals. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
