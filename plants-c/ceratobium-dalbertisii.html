                    <h1>Ceratobium dalbertisii</h1>
<p>Ceratobium dalbertisii, commonly known as the Dalbert's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, and it flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy or boggy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
