                    <h1>Callisia filiformis</h1>
<p>Callisia filiformis, commonly known as the spider plant, is a popular ornamental plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, bright green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. It is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its ability to spread easily through runners.</p>
<p>Callisia filiformis is relatively low maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring moderate watering.</p>
