                    <h1>Calypso bulbosa f. biflora</h1>
<p>Calypso bulbosa f. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered sea orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rocky shores of the western Atlantic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on exposed rock surfaces where it can access salt spray and sunlight. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and specialized roots that help it anchor in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
