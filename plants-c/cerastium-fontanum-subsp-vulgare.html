<p>Cerastium fontanum subsp.</p>
<p>vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads primarily through stolons, allowing it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
