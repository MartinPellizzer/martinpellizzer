<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its trunk is often buttressed and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a dominant species in its habitat.</p>
