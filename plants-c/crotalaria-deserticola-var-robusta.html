                    <h1>Crotalaria deserticola var. robusta</h1>
<p>Crotalaria deserticola var. robusta, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
