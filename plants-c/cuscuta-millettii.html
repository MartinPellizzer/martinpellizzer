                    <h1>Cuscuta millettii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta millettii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant spreads by attaching itself to various host species, including crops and weeds, through specialized sucking structures called haustoria. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
