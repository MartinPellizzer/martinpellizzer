                    <h1>Crepidomanes rupicola</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure is a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between its fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
