<p>Coccothrinax clarensis subsp.</p>
<p>perrigida, commonly known as the Clarendon palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and feather-like leaves that form a dense crown.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone formations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and restricted distribution.</p>
