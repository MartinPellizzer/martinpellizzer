<p>Callitriche spuria, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and streams, and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can affect water flow and sedimentation.</p>
<p>Callitriche spuria is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
