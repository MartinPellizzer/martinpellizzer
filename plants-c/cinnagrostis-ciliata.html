                    <h1>Cinnagrostis ciliata</h1>
<p>Cinnagrostis ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cinnagrostis ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
