<p>Coppensia alvesiana, commonly known as the Alvesian heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, evergreen leaves, and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Coppensia alvesiana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
