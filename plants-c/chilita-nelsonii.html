<p>Chilita nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's chilita, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita nelsonii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
