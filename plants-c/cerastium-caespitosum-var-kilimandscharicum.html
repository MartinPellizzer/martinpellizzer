                    <h1>Cerastium caespitosum var. kilimandscharicum</h1>
<p>Cerastium caespitosum var. kilimandscharicum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its compact form and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
