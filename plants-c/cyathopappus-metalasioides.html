                    <h1>Cyathopappus metalasioides</h1>
<p>Cyathopappus metalasioides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, silvery-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its spread across sandy soils.</p>
