                    <h1>Cliocarpus</h1>
<p>Cliocarpus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves, which help it survive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant has a robust root system, including pneumatophores that allow it to breathe in waterlogged soils. Cliocarpus species are often found in mangrove forests, playing a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
