                    <h1>Chionochloa oreophila var. elata</h1>
<p>Chionochloa oreophila var. elata, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
