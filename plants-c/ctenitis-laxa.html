<p>Ctenitis laxa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, often growing on rocky substrates. The plant has fronds that are broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Ctenitis laxa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration.</p>
