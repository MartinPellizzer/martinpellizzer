<p>Carex aurea, commonly known as golden sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically visible in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Carex aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
