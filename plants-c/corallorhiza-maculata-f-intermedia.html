                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spotted coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, and it thrives in shaded, moist woodlands. Its root system is specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with fungi, which is a key botanical feature.</p>
<p>This orchid is part of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its unique nutritional strategy.</p>
