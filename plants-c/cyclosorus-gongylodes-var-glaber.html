                    <h1>Cyclosorus gongylodes var. glaber</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus gongylodes var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
