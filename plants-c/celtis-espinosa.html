<p>Celtis espinosa, commonly known as the spiny hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, spiny bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by pale green to red berries that are edible for some wildlife but generally considered unpalatable by humans. Celtis espinosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyons.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
