<p>Coffea canephora var. hinaultii, commonly known as the "Hinaultii" variety, is a rare and less commercially cultivated subspecies of robusta coffee.</p>
<p>It is native to the high altitudes of western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and Gabon. This variety is characterized by its small, oval-shaped beans and a distinct, earthy flavor profile. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is often considered a specialty or heirloom coffee variety.</p>
