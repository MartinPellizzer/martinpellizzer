<p>Ceratophyllum llerenae, commonly known as the Llerena hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and the presence of small, needle-like leaves. This plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its stems for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum llerenae plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
