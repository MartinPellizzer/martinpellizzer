                    <h1>Corallorhiza trifida f. suaveolens</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza trifida f. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph.</p>
<p>This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
