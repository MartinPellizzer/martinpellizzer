<p>Cycas riuminiana, commonly known as the Southern cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones bearing ovules that are pollinated by specific insects. Cycas riuminiana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
