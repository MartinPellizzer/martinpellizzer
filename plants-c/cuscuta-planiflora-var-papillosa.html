                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. papillosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
