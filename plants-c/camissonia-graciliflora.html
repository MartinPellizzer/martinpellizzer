<p>Camissonia graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered camissonia, is a flowering plant native to California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as coastal bluffs and grasslands. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and linear.</p>
<p>Camissonia graciliflora is often found in serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients, making it an indicator species for such environments.</p>
