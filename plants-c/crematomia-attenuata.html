                    <h1>Crematomia attenuata</h1>
<p>Crematomia attenuata, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Crematomia attenuata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
