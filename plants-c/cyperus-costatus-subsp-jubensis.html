<p>Cyperus costatus subsp.</p>
<p>jubensis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
