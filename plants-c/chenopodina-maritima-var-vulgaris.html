<p>Chenopodina maritima var. vulgaris, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora.</p>
