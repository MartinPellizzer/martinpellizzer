                    <h1>Carex pyrenaica var. mondsii</h1>
<p>Carex pyrenaica var. mondsii, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
