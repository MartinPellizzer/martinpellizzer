<p>Campanula rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>paenina, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies paenina is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms.</p>
