<p>Cereus dyckii, commonly known as the night bloomer or desert nightshade, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus dyckii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates.</p>
