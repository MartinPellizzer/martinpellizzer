                    <h1>Conophytum fossulatum</h1>
<p>Conophytum fossulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the cooler months. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
