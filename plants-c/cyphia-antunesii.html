                    <h1>Cyphia antunesii</h1>
<p>Cyphia antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' cyphia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of São Tomé in Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
