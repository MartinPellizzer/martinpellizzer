                            <h1>Chamaeraphis Prostrata</h1>
<p>Sandspurry, scientifically known as Chamaeraphis prostrata, is a low-growing, flowering plant commonly found in sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Native to regions such as Europe, Asia, and North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and harsh conditions. Despite its modest appearance, Sandspurry plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local ecosystems. Its resilience and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
