                    <h1>Cuscuta elpassiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta elpassiana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host plant and then penetrating it with haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
