<p>Chenolea convallis, commonly known as the creeping chenopod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous and adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Chenolea convallis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments.</p>
