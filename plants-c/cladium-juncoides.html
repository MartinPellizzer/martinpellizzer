                    <h1>Cladium juncoides</h1>
<p>Cladium juncoides, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves that are often lined with fine, tooth-like projections. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Sawgrass plays a crucial role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
