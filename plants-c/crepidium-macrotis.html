<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species.</p>
