<p>Cladium mariscus subsp.</p>
<p>martii, commonly known as the Florida marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing mudflats and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help in preventing erosion in coastal areas.</p>
