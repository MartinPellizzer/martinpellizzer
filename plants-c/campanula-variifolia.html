<p>Campanula variifolia, commonly known as the variable bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive variegation pattern. The plant produces tall, slender stems bearing bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Campanula variifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments.</p>
