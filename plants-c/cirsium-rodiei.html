                    <h1>Cirsium rodiei</h1>
<p>Cirsium rodiei, commonly known as the Hoary Thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-blue, woolly leaves and spiny, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its spiny structure serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cirsium rodiei is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
