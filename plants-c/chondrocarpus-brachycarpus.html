<p>Chondrocarpus brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-fruited cartwheel fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. The plant has a robust rhizome with a distinctive cartwheel-like structure formed by its fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, strap-like shape and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
