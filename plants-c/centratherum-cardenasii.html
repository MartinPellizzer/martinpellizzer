                    <h1>Centratherum cardenasii</h1>
<p>Centratherum cardenasii, commonly known as the Cienega grass or Cienega dune grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Centratherum cardenasii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
