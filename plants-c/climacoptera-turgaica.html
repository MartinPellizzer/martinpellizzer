                    <h1>Climacoptera turgaica</h1>
<p>Climacoptera turgaica, commonly known as the mountain flame, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Turgaic Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with a dense, fibrous bark that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Climacoptera turgaica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
