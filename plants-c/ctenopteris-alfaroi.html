                    <h1>Ctenopteris alfaroi</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi's sea holly, is a species of marine fern that thrives in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique fronds that are adapted to withstand saltwater spray and tidal forces. The plant's reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters along the fronds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>This species is found primarily in the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Philippines.</p>
