                    <h1>Cymbopogon tortilis var. goeringii</h1>
<p>Cymbopogon tortilis var. goeringii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its essential oils, rich in citral and other terpenes, contribute to its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other lemon grass species but is distinguished by its unique morphological features and chemical composition.</p>
