<p>Cedrela regnellii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
