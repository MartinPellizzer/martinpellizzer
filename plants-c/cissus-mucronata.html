<p>Cissus mucronata, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing or trailing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Cissus mucronata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
