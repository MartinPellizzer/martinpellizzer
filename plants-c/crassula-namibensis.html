                    <h1>Crassula namibensis</h1>
<p>Crassula namibensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert Crassula, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the cooler months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a resilient and low-maintenance plant for arid environments.</p>
