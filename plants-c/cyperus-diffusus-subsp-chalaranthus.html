<p>Cyperus diffusus subsp.</p>
<p>chalaranthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) but is often classified under the sedge family (Cyperaceae) due to its morphological similarities.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its narrow leaves and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
