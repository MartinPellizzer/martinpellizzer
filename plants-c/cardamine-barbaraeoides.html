<p>Cardamine barbaraeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a single cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Cardamine barbaraeoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
