<p>Comarostaphylis polifolia subsp.</p>
<p>coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan pincushion cactus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique morphology includes a dense, cushion-like growth form with many short, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
