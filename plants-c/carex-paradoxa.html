<p>Carex paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex paradoxa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
