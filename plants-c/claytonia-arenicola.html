                    <h1>Claytonia arenicola</h1>
<p>Claytonia arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Claytonia arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
