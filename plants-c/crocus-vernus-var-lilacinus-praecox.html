<p>Crocus vernus var. lilacinus-praecox, commonly known as the early purple crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soil. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early flowering habit.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other crocus species and is sometimes confused with C. vernus due to similar characteristics.</p>
