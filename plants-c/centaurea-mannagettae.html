<p>Centaurea mannagettae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its environment.
