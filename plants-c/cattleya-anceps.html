                    <h1>Cattleya anceps</h1>
<p>Cattleya anceps, commonly known as the common cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more textured. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and they absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Cattleya anceps is prized in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
