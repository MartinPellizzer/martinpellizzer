                    <h1>Cedrelopsis ambanjensis</h1>
<p>Cedrelopsis ambanjensis, commonly known as the Madagascar cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
