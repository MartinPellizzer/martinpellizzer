                    <h1>Cladium xanthocarpum</h1>
<p>Cladium xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by yellow, boat-shaped fruits that are adapted for water dispersal. Cladium xanthocarpum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for environments with fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
