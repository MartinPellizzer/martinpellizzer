                    <h1>Cuscuta odontolepis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta odontolepis, commonly known as the toothed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are pale and thread-like, with a tendency to twine around the stems of its host. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is commonly found on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death.</p>
