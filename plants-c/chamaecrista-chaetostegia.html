<p>Chamaecrista chaetostegia, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
