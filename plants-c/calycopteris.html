                    <h1>Calycopteris</h1>
<p>Calycopteris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Calycopteris species are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. They are adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and are drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Calycopteris inulifolia, which is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
