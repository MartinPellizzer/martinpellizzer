                    <h1>Cactus erectus</h1>
<p>Cactus erectus, commonly known as the upright cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spines and areoles, which are specialized structures for housing the plant's defensive mechanisms and flowering parts. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Cactus erectus is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
