                    <h1>Cyanaeorchis arundinae</h1>
<p>Cyanaeorchis arundinae, commonly known as the green orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are long and narrow, often forming dense clumps, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
