<p>Crucifera procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mustard, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or spreading habit, with small, elongated leaves and yellow flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
