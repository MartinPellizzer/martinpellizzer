                    <h1>Crocus harpkeae</h1>
<p>Crocus harpkeae, commonly known as the Harpke's crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its bulbs are small and adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions, and it is closely related to other members of the Crocusspecies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity.</p>
