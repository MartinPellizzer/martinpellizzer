<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>regia, commonly known as the royal brittle fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, silky leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its fragile, papery fronds give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
