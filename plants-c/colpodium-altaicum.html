<p>Colpodium altaicum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Colpodium altaicum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
