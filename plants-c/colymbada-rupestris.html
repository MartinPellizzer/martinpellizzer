<p>Colymbada rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Colymbada rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
