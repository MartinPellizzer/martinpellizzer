<p>Cerastium triviale var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
