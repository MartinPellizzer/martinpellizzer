                    <h1>Carex stricta f. brevior</h1>
<p>Carex stricta f. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed bulrush, is a compact form of the common bulrush.</p>
<p>It is a perennial sedge that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. It is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex stricta, with more condensed stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
