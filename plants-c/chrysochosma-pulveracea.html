                    <h1>Chrysochosma pulveracea</h1>
<p>Chrysochosma pulveracea, commonly known as the golden dustplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
