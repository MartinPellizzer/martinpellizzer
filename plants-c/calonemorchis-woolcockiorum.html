<p>Calonemorchis woolcockiorum, commonly known as Woolcock's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are short and erect, with distinctive blue or purple petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
