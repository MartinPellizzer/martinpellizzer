                    <h1>Chascolytrum juergensii var. angustilemma</h1>
<p>Chascolytrum juergensii var. angustilemma, commonly known as the narrow-lemma chascolytrum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
