<p>Crepis juvenalis, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, rounded leaves and tiny white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Crepis juvenalis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
