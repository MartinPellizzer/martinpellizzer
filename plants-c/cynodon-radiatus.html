                    <h1>Cynodon radiatus</h1>
<p>Cynodon radiatus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used for ornamental purposes. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly and form a dense mat, which helps suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.</p>
