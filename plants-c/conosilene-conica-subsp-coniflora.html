<p>Conosilene conica subsp.</p>
<p>coniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved conosilene, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
