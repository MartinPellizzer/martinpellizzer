                    <h1>Condylocarpon longii</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon longii, commonly known as the longii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rock surfaces or bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
