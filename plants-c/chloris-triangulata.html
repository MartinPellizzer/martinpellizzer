<p>Chloris triangulata, commonly known as the triangular grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed seed heads that are distinctive in appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover.</p>
<p>Chloris triangulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
