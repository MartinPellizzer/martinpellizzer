<p>Cheilanthes covillei subsp.</p>
<p>intertexta, commonly known as the intertextured rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in crevices and on limestone formations, showcasing its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
