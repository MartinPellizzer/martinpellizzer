                    <h1>Calamagrostis latissima</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis latissima, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
