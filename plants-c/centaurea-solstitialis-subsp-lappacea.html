<p>Centaurea solstitialis subsp.</p>
<p>lappacea, commonly known as yellow starthistle, is a perennial weed native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in arid and disturbed environments. It is invasive in many parts of the western United States, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its rapid spread.</p>
