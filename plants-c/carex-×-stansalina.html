                    <h1>Carex × stansalina</h1>
<p>Carex × stansalina, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex acutata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in wet to moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats.</p>
