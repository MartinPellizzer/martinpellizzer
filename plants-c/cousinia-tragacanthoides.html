<p>Cousinia tragacanthoides, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia tragacanthoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
