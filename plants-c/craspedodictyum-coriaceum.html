                    <h1>Craspedodictyum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Craspedodictyum coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved craspedodictyum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
