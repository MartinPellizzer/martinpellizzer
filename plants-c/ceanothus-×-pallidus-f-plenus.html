                    <h1>Ceanothus × pallidus f. plenus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus × pallidus f. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered palo verde, is a hybrid shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bright green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil make it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>The full-flowered form distinguishes it from other ceanothus species by its more abundant and showy blooms.</p>
