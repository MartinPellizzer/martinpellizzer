                    <h1>Cactus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Cactus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic cactus, is a unique plant that derives its nutrients from host plants rather than through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and typically attaches itself to the stems or roots of other cacti or shrubs. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are often vibrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is found in arid and semi-arid regions where host plants are abundant.</p>
