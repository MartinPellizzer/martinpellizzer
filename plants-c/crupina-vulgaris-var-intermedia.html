                    <h1>Crupina vulgaris var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Crupina vulgaris var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
