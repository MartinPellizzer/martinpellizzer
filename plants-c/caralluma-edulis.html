                    <h1>Caralluma edulis</h1>
<p>Caralluma edulis, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert apple, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma edulis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including appetite suppression and energy enhancement.</p>
