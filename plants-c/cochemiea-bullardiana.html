                    <h1>Cochemiea bullardiana</h1>
<p>Cochemiea bullardiana, commonly known as the Bullard's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green to blue-gray stems that are ribbed and covered in white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Cochemiea bullardiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
