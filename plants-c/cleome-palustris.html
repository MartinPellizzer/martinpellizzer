                    <h1>Cleome palustris</h1>
<p>Cleome palustris, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds.</p>
<p>Cleome palustris plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
