                    <h1>Ctenitis deflexa</h1>
<p>Ctenitis deflexa, commonly known as the bent frond fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or bent, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ctenitis deflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
