<p>Cuatresia foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's cuatresia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cuatresia foreroi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
