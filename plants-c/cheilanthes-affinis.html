                    <h1>Cheilanthes affinis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes affinis, commonly known as the rock fern or leatherwood fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes affinis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
