<p>Cuscuta australis subsp.</p>
<p>cesatiana, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts.</p>
<p>The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecological interactions, though it can be considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
