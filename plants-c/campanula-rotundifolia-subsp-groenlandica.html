<p>Campanula rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, rounded, hairy leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
