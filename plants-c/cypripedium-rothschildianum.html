                    <h1>Cypripedium rothschildianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium rothschildianum, commonly known as Rothschild's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
