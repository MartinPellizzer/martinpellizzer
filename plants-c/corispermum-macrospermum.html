<p>Corispermum macrospermum, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. It is typically found in coastal areas, marshes, and other wetlands with high salt content.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in challenging, waterlogged conditions.</p>
