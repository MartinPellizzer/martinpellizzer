<p>Chaptalia, commonly known as the "cup-of-joy" or "cup-of-sun," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves that resemble those of carrots or parsley. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Chaptalia species are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
