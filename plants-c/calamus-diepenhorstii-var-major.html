                    <h1>Calamus diepenhorstii var. major</h1>
<p>Calamus diepenhorstii var. major, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a species of cycad native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
