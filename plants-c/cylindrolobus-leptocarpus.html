                    <h1>Cylindrolobus leptocarpus</h1>
<p>Cylindrolobus leptocarpus, commonly known as the slender-fruited cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unbranched, cylindrical trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among cycads.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is noted for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
