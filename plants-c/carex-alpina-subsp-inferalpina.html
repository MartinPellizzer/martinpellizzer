<p>Carex alpina subsp.</p>
<p>inferalpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting alpine biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
