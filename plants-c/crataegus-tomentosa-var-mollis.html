<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy underside, giving the plant its "mollis" variety name, which means soft or downy. The fruit is a small, red-pink berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods.</p>
