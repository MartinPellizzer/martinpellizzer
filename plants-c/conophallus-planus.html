                    <h1>Conophallus planus</h1>
<p>Conophallus planus, commonly known as the flat conophallus, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces aerial roots that help it cling to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
