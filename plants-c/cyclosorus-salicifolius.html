<p>Cyclosorus salicifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features creeping rhizomes and produces small, floating leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant is characterized by its delicate, green, and often hairy foliage, which helps it thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. It blooms with small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus salicifolius plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
