                    <h1>Chorizanthe turbinata</h1>
<p>Chorizanthe turbinata, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Chorizanthe turbinata is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
