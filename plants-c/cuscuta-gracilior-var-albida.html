                    <h1>Cuscuta gracilior var. albida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gracilior var. albida, commonly known as the white dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
