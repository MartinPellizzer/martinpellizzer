                    <h1>Cecropia heterochroma</h1>
<p>Cecropia heterochroma, commonly known as the variable cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azobacter bacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its hollow stems and rapid growth make it an important component of rainforest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, contributing to ecological succession.</p>
