                    <h1>Cleistogenes hackelii</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and limited water environments.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes hackelii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
