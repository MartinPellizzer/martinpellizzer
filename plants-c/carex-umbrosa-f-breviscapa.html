<p>Carex umbrosa f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed shadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are shorter and more compact than those of the typical Carex umbrosa. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
