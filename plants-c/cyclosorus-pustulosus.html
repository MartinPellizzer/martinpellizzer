<p>Cyclosorus pustulosus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive, hairy appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pustulosus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
