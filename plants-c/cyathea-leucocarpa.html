<p>Cyathea leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruit tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction through spores.
