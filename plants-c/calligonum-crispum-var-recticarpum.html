                    <h1>Calligonum crispum var. recticarpum</h1>
<p>Calligonum crispum var. recticarpum, commonly known as the curly saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely branched, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
