<p>Chimaphila umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghostplant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, often found in pine-oak forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
