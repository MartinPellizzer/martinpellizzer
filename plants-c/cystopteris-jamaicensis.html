                    <h1>Cystopteris jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while its fronds float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
