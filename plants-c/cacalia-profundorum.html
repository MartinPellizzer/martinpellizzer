                    <h1>Cacalia profundorum</h1>
<p>Cacalia profundorum, commonly known as the deepwater bellflower, is a rare aquatic plant found in deep, still waters.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate below. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in nutrient-rich, oxygenated environments and is often found in lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
