                    <h1>Cardiocrinum cordatum f. sordidum</h1>
<p>Cardiocrinum cordatum f. sordidum, commonly known as the sordid form of the heartleaf lily, is a rare and striking variant of the Cardiocrinum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage and unusually shaped, heart-shaped leaves. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers.</p>
