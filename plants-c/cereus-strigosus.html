                    <h1>Cereus strigosus</h1>
<p>Cereus strigosus, commonly known as the velvety cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate flowers, the plant is highly resilient and can thrive with minimal water and sunlight.</p>
