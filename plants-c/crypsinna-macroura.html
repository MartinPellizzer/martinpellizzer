<p>Crypsinna macroura, commonly known as the long-tongued orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive elongated lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps, which are attracted to its nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
