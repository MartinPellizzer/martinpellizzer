<p>Cladobium epiphytum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant is characterized by its striking, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, silky coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cladobium epiphytum is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
