<p>Cypripedium godefroyae var. leucochilum, commonly known as the white-lipped cypripedium, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive white lip and a pinkish or reddish upper lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forest understories and alpine meadows. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it produces a single, upright flower stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
