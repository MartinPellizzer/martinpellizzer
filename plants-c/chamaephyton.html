                    <h1>Chamaephyton</h1>
<p>Chamaephyton, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a type of plant that forms dense, low-growing mats or cushions near the ground.</p>
<p>These plants typically thrive in harsh environments such as alpine regions, tundra, or rocky areas where conditions are extreme. Their compact growth form helps them conserve moisture and withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Chamaephyton species are often found in ecosystems with poor soil and limited nutrients.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
