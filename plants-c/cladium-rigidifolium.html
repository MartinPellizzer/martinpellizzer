                    <h1>Cladium rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Cladium rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure of marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cladium rigidifolium plays an important role in nutrient cycling and water filtration in wetland habitats.</p>
