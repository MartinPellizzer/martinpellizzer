<p>Cistanche flava subsp.</p>
<p>flava, commonly known as the yellow parasitic weed, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host plants to absorb water and nutrients. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for photosynthesis. Its stems are fleshy and yellow, often growing in dense clusters.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
