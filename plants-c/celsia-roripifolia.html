                    <h1>Celsia roripifolia</h1>
<p>Celsia roripifolia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season pollinator plant.</p>
