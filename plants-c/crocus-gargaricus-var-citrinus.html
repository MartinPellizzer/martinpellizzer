<p>Crocus gargaricus var. citrinus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in the autumn. The plant produces small, triangular-shaped leaves and has a corm as its underground storage organ. Its most notable feature is the stigmas, which are harvested to produce saffron, a highly valued spice and dye.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its economic value in the saffron trade.</p>
