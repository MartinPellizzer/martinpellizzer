<p>Conceveiba belizensis, commonly known as the Belize veveiba, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in vibrant shades of red and orange.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Conceveiba belizensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
