                    <h1>Campyloneurum abruptum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings.</p>
