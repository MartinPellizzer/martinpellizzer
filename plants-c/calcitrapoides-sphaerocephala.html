<p>Calcitrapoides sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed calcitrap, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, inflated head, which is composed of tightly packed bracts that form a distinctive, lantern-like structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology and habitat, it is often found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
