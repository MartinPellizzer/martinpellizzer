                    <h1>Caralluma foulcheri-delboscii var. greenbergiana</h1>
<p>Caralluma foulcheri-delboscii var. greenbergiana, commonly known as the Greenberg's devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spine-tipped stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Caralluma species, sharing similar growth habits and ecological adaptations.</p>
