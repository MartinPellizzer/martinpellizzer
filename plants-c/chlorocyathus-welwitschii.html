<p>Chlorocyathus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's green cup, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, fleshy stems that are typically green in color, which help it store water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
