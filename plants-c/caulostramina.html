                    <h1>Caulostramina</h1>
<p>Caulostramina, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in its pollination by nocturnal insects. Its botanical structure includes a short, woody stem with a fibrous root system adapted to its moist, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Caulostramina is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
