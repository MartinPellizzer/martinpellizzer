                    <h1>Caprifolium japonicum</h1>
<p>Caprifolium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a strong, bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions.</p>
