<p>Corrigiola telephiifolia subsp.</p>
<p>imbricata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve water in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store moisture, making it well-suited for dry climates.</p>
<p>The subspecies imbricata is distinguished by its tightly overlapping leaf arrangement, which provides additional protection against wind and sun.</p>
