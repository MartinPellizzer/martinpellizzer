<p>Chaenostoma cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing pale blue to purple petals.</p>
<p>Chaenostoma cordatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
