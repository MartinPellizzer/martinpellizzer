<p>Chinese hackberry, scientifically known as Celtis tetrandra var. hamiltonii, is a versatile and hardy tree native to eastern Asia. It is commonly found in China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and climates. The tree is valued for its resilience, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping and reforestation projects. Its small, dark berries and attractive foliage contribute to its ornamental appeal. Despite its benefits, the plant remains underappreciated in many regions outside its native range.</p>
