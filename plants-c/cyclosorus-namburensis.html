                    <h1>Cyclosorus namburensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus namburensis, commonly known as the Nambu cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
