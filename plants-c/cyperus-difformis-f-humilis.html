<p>Cyperus difformis f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along waterways, or in disturbed sites. Its compact form and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is also used in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of heavy metals and pollutants.</p>
