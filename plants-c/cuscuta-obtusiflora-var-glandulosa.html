                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is characterized by its glandular structures on the stems, which aid in adhesion and nutrient absorption from the host. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing various shrubs and herbs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
