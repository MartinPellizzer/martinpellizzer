                    <h1>Cogswellia nevadensis var. pseudorientalis</h1>
<p>Cogswellia nevadensis var. pseudorientalis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring dense clusters of short, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
