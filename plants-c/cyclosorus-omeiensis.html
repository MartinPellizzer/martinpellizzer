                    <h1>Cyclosorus omeiensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain cyclosorus, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
