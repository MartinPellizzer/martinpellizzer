<p>Carparomorchis baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble translucent petals. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture and specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
