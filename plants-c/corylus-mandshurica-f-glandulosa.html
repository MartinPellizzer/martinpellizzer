                    <h1>Corylus mandshurica f. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Corylus mandshurica f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hazel, is a variant of the mandshurian hazel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which are distinctive botanical features. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces edible nuts similar to other hazel species.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its surfaces may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens.</p>
