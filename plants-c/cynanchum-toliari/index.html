<p>Cynanchum toliari is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is known for its unique, tubular flowers. This climbing plant features long, slender stems and waxy, green leaves. Its flowers, often in shades of yellow and green, bloom during the dry season. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
