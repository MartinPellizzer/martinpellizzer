                    <h1>Calanthe wrayi</h1>
<p>Calanthe wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical petals that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe wrayi is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
