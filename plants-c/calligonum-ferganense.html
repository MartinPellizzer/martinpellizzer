<p>Calligonum ferganense, commonly known as the Fergana spurge, is a shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and branched stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calligonum ferganense is adapted to semi-desert and steppe habitats, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions.</p>
