                    <h1>Carex ovoidoconica</h1>
<p>Carex ovoidoconica, commonly known as the oval-conical sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it effective for erosion control.</p>
<p>Carex ovoidoconica is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal.</p>
