                    <h1>Crataegus aridula</h1>
<p>Crataegus aridula, commonly known as the desert hawthorn, is a small deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, thorny stems, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Crataegus aridula is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry environments.</p>
