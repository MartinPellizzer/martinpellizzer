                    <h1>Calligonum patens var. lamellatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum patens var. lamellatum, commonly known as the flatleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, spreading pattern, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used for erosion control and as a source of forage in desert ecosystems.</p>
