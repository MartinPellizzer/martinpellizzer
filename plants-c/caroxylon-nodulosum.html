                    <h1>Caroxylon nodulosum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon nodulosum, commonly known as the nodular cycad, is a unique plant species characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern South America, where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Caroxylon nodulosum is listed as endangered by the IUCN.</p>
