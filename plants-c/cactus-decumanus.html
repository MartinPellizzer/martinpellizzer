                    <h1>Cactus decumanus</h1>
<p>Cactus decumanus, commonly known as the decumbent cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling, low-growing habit, with stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus also has small, spiny areoles that can bear both flowers and later, small, round fruits.</p>
