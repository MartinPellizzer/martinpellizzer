<p>Carex vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>elytroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
