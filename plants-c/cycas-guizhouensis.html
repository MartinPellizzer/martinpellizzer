                    <h1>Cycas guizhouensis</h1>
<p>Cycas guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the trunk. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Cycas guizhouensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
