                    <h1>Carex canescens var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Carex canescens var. tenuis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
