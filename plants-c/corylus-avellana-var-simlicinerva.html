<p>Corylus avellana var. simlicinerva, commonly known as the smooth-shelled hazelnut, is a variety of the common hazel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous husks that encase the edible nuts, distinguishing it from other hazel varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, typically turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>It produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, contributing to its role in wind pollination.</p>
