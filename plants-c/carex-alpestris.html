                    <h1>Carex alpestris</h1>
<p>Carex alpestris, commonly known as alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Carex alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
