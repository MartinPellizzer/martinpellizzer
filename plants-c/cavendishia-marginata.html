                    <h1>Cavendishia marginata</h1>
<p>Cavendishia marginata, commonly known as the marginata orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in clusters rather than from a single stem. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Cavendishia marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
