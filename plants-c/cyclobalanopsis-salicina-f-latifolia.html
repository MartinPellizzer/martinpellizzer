                    <h1>Cyclobalanopsis salicina f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis salicina f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a variant of the cyclobalanopsis species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by hard, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland to hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its dense wood and slow growth, it is valued for timber and has ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>
