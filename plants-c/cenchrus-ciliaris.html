                    <h1>Cenchrus ciliaris</h1>
<p>Cenchrus ciliaris, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in dry grasslands and savannas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is widely used for forage in livestock grazing and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
