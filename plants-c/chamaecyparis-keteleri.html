                    <h1>Chamaecyparis keteleri</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis keteleri, commonly known as the Keteler's cedar, is a rare coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and distinctive scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue, and it is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a valuable subject for studies on plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
