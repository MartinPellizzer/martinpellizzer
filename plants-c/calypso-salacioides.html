                    <h1>Calypso salacioides</h1>
<p>Calypso salacioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a leafless plant that derives all its nutrients from its symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly figure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in the canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
