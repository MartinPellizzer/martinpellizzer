                    <h1>Caralluma acutiloba</h1>
<p>Caralluma acutiloba, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange berries that are toxic to humans but have been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
