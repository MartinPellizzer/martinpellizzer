                    <h1>Cladocolea pringlei</h1>
<p>Cladocolea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cliffbracken, is a rare fern native to the rocky coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, wind-swept environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone cliffs. The plant has leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
