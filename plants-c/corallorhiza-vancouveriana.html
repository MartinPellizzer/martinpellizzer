<p>Corallorhiza vancouveriana, commonly known as Vancouver beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations, it is sensitive to habitat disturbance and environmental changes.</p>
