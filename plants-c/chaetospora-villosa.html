                    <h1>Chaetospora villosa</h1>
<p>Chaetospora villosa, commonly known as the hairy spore moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and hairy leaf surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks.</p>
<p>Chaetospora villosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
