<p>Calligonum aphyllum var. androssowii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and gray-green, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, which are followed by dry, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
