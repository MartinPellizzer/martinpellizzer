                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. septentrionalis, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf that forms a mat-like structure, making it highly effective for erosion control and as a lawn grass. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish quickly in various environmental conditions.</p>
