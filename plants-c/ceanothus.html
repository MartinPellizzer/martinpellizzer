                    <h1>Ceanothus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus, commonly known as California lilac, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>These shrubs are characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers that bloom in spring. Ceanothus species are often adapted to dry, rocky soils and are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic value and hardiness.</p>
