<p>Cassebeeria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered cassebeer, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cassebeeria biflora is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system.</p>
