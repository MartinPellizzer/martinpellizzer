<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>It features delicate, alternate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in moist soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its interrupted leaf patterns and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
