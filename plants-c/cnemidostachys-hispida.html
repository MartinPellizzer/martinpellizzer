                    <h1>Cnemidostachys hispida</h1>
<p>Cnemidostachys hispida, commonly known as the woolly spike grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, mat-like clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its textured appearance and ability to provide ground cover in dry environments.</p>
