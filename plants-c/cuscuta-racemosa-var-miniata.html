                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. miniata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. miniata, commonly known as the redstem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the stage of development. The plant forms dense, tangled mats on its host, often covering the stems and leaves. It is commonly found on a variety of herbaceous plants, particularly in disturbed soils and open areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
