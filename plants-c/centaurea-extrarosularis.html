<p>Centaurea extrarosularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America.</p>
