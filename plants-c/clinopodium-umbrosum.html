                    <h1>Clinopodium umbrosum</h1>
<p>Clinopodium umbrosum, commonly known as shadow mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves with a mint-like scent, and its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Clinopodium umbrosum is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses.</p>
