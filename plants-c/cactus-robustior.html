                    <h1>Cactus robustior</h1>
<p>Cactus robustior, commonly known as the robust cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Cactus robustior is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
