<p>Cassytha capensis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its stems are slender, twining, and can grow along the surface of its host.</p>
<p>Cassytha capensis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
