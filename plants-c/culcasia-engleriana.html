                    <h1>Culcasia engleriana</h1>
<p>Culcasia engleriana, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped floating leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culcasia engleriana is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
