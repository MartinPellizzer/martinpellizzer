                    <h1>Centaurea kerneriana</h1>
<p>Centaurea kerneriana, commonly known as Kerner's star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, but it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
