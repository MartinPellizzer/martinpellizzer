<p>Ceterach lobatum, commonly known as the coastal rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. It is often found growing on coastal cliffs, dunes, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
