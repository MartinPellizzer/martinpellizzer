                    <h1>Carduus nutans var. brachycentrus</h1>
<p>Carduus nutans var. brachycentrus, commonly known as the short-stalked thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with a hairy stem and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in stiff bristles. Its flowers are yellow and appear in dense clusters, often surrounded by a series of spiny bracts.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical Carduus nutans, making it a notable subspecies in botanical studies.</p>
