                    <h1>Cyperus thyrsiflorus var. macrior</h1>
<p>Cyperus thyrsiflorus var. macrior, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots, slender stems, and small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
