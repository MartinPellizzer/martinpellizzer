                    <h1>Chaerophyllum biasolettii</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum biasolettii, commonly known as the Italian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and tall flowering stems.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that some species of Chaerophyllum can be toxic, and caution should be exercised when handling or consuming any part of the plant.</p>
