                    <h1>Cryptosorus dionaea</h1>
<p>Cryptosorus dionaea, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It features specialized leaves that function as traps, each consisting of two hinged lobes lined with sensitive trigger hairs. When an insect touches these hairs, the lobes snap shut, capturing the prey. The plant digests the trapped insects using enzymes secreted within the trap to obtain nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with animal matter.</p>
