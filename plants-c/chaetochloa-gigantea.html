<p>Chaetochloa gigantea, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender blades that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa gigantea is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
