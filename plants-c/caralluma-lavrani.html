                    <h1>Caralluma lavrani</h1>
<p>Caralluma lavrani, commonly known as the Desert Cucumber, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, pale flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study in desert ecosystems.</p>
