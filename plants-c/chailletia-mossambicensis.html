                    <h1>Chailletia mossambicensis</h1>
<p>Chailletia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique chailletia, is a rare and specialized moss species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. The plant has a delicate, cushion-like growth form, with small, overlapping leaves that are often densely packed. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a unique example of moss adaptation to tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
