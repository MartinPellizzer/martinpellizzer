                    <h1>Crenulluma arabica</h1>
<p>Crenulluma arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red berries. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a precursor to the modern coffee plant, Coffea arabica.</p>
<p>However, it is less cultivated today due to its lower yield and smaller size compared to its descendant.</p>
