<p>Chodanthus montecillense, commonly known as the Montecillo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Chodanthus montecillense is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and mountainous environments.</p>
