<p>Calligonum crinitum subsp.</p>
<p>arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian goat's beard, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its grey-green, woolly leaves and long, drooping inflorescences that resemble a beard.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, saline soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy soils in desert environments.</p>
