                    <h1>Cactus lanifer</h1>
<p>Cactus lanifer, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines that provide additional defense against herbivores. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Despite its harsh environment, the woolly cactus plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife.</p>
