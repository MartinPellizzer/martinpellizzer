<p>Cryptophaseolus anamensis, commonly known as the Anamensis bean, is a rare legume native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical seeds and compound leaves with trifoliate arrangements. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it produces pods that contain the edible seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species.</p>
