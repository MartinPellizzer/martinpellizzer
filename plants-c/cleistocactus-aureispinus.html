<p>Cleistocactus aureispinus, commonly known as the golden-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance characterized by its golden-yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The cleistocactus aureispinus is well-suited for cultivation in xerophytic gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
