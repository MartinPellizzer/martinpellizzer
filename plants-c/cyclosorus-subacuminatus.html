                    <h1>Cyclosorus subacuminatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus subacuminatus, commonly known as the narrow-pointed water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, four-leaf clover-like structure, which is typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus subacuminatus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
