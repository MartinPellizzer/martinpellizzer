<p>Chlorocharis geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
