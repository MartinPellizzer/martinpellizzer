                    <h1>Claoxylopsis perrieri</h1>
<p>Claoxylopsis perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to certain regions of Madagascar and is often found in humid, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
