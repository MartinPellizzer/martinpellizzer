                    <h1>Cieca microcalyx</h1>
<p>Cieca microcalyx, commonly known as the small calyx cieca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, small calyx that encases its tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
