                    <h1>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. virgata</h1>
<p>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's tresses or the hairpin fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, hairpin-shaped fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
