<p>Cumulopuntia boliviana subsp.</p>
<p>boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian rock cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, mound-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and high-altitude conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat.</p>
