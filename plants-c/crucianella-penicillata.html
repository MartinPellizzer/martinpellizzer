                    <h1>Crucianella penicillata</h1>
<p>Crucianella penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Crucianella penicillata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and can be an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water.</p>
<p>Its presence is often associated with wetland ecosystems and can contribute to the ecological balance by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
