<p>Crassula alata subsp.</p>
<p>pharnaceoides, commonly known as the "Lamb's Ear" or "Silver Bush," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green with a silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
