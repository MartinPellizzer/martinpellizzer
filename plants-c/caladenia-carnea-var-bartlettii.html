<p>Caladenia carnea var. bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, intricately patterned flower that resembles a spider, hence its common name. The flower typically features a pale pink or cream-colored dorsal sepal and a deep red or purple lip, with intricate veining. This variety thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
