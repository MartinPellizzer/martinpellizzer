                    <h1>Crotalaria onusta</h1>
<p>Crotalaria onusta, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its seed pods are cylindrical and dehiscent, splitting open to release the seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>The plant's common name comes from the sound it makes when the seed pods dry and rattle in the wind.</p>
