                    <h1>Campanula brunonis</h1>
<p>Campanula brunonis, commonly known as the purple bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>
