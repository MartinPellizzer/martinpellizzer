<p>Cynosurus elegans subsp.</p>
<p>obliquatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions.</p>
