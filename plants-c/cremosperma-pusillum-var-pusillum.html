<p>Cremosperma pusillum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small crested tamarisk, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and woody, allowing it to thrive in saline and coastal soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
