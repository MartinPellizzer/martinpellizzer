<p>Carpinus compressus, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its hard wood has been historically used for tool handles and furniture.</p>
