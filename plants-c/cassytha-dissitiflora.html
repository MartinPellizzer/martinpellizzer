                    <h1>Cassytha dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Cassytha dissitiflora, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters along its slender, twining stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the stems of other plants.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread easily make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
