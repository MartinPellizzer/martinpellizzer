<p>Chamaeangis vesicata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in wetlands, ponds, and other waterlogged environments. Chamaeangis vesicata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting prey.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found above the water surface.</p>
