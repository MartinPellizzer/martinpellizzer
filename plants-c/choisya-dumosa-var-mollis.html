<p>Choisya dumosa var. mollis, commonly known as silverleaf hedge.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
