<p>Chamaespartium sagittale subsp.</p>
<p>delphinense, commonly known as the Delphinium-like false brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with tufts of blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, showy florets that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for true delphiniums due to its similar flower structure, but it lacks the typical delphinium's spurred petals.</p>
