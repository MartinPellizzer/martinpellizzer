                    <h1>Crassula elatinoides</h1>
<p>Crassula elatinoides, commonly known as the stone plant or ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring and summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Crassula elatinoides is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion on rocky slopes.</p>
