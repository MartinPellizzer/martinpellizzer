<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals that are fused at the base, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
