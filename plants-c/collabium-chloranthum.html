                    <h1>Collabium chloranthum</h1>
<p>Collabium chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Collabium chloranthum is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations.</p>
