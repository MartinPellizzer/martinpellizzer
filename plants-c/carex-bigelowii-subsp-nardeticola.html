<p>Carex bigelowii subsp.</p>
<p>nardeticola, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
