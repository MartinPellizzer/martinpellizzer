                    <h1>Callitriche autumnalis f. natans</h1>
<p>Callitriche autumnalis f. natans, commonly known as floating water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and streams, where it can anchor itself with its root system. The plant's leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers from late summer to autumn, which are often submerged or just at the water's edge.</p>
<p>This floating form is adapted to aquatic environments, making it an important part of wetland ecosystems.</p>
