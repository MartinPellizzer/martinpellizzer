<p>It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence the species name *coriacea*, which means "leathery" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
