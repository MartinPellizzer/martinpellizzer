<p>Campanula portensis, commonly known as the Portentous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula portensis is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
