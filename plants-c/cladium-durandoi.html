<p>Cladium durandoi, commonly known as the dwarf sawgrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Cladium durandoi plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat.</p>
