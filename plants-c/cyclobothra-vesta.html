                <h1>Cyclobothra vesta</h1>
<p>Cyclobothra vesta, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is covered in small, star-shaped lobes. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, with the alga providing photosynthetic capability and the fungus offering structural support. It typically grows on bark, soil, and rock surfaces, and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct appearance and ecological role, it is a common indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
