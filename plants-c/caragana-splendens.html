<p>Caragana splendens, commonly known as the golden peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall foliage, which turns reddish-brown.</p>
