<p>Cyathea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Cyathea rufescens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
