                    <h1>Cypripedium peteri</h1>
<p>Cypripedium peteri, commonly known as the Yunnan lily, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
