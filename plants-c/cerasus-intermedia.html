                    <h1>Cerasus intermedia</h1>
<p>Cerasus intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or Manchurian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve fruit quality in cultivated cherries.</p>
<p>Cerasus intermedia is also adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in temperate climates.</p>
