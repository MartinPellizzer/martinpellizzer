<p>Crepinia adriatica, commonly known as the Adriatic crepinia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in summer, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
