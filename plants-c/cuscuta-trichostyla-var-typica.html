                    <h1>Cuscuta trichostyla var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta trichostyla var. typica, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that缠绕 around host plants. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on plants such as grasses and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host and developing specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
