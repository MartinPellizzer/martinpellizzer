                    <h1>Coryanthes thivii</h1>
<p>Coryanthes thivii, commonly known as the Thivier's coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with intricate, often colorful patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant produces a unique structure called a "lip," which serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Its growth is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment.</p>
