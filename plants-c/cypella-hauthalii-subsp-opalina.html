<p>Cypella hauthalii subsp.</p>
<p>opalina, commonly known as the Opalina cypella, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white, adding a subtle aesthetic to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
