                    <h1>Cavea</h1>
<p>Cavea, commonly known as the cave plant, is a unique species that thrives in rocky, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white, blending with its surroundings. Its root system is shallow and spreads out to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Cavea is often found in limestone caves and crevices, making it a fascinating example of a plant that has evolved to survive in extreme habitats.</p>
