                    <h1>Carex goodenowii f. fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Carex goodenowii f. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty sedges, is a sedge species characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base, forming dense, compact clumps. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like structure with small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
