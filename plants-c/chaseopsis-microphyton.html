<p>Chaseopsis microphyton, commonly known as the small-leaved chaseopsis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, orbicular leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Chaseopsis microphyton is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic distribution.</p>
