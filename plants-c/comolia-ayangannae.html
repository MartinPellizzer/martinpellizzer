                    <h1>Comolia ayangannae</h1>
<p>Comolia ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannae ghost fern, is a rare and unique species native to the humid rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Comolia ayangannae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying rare plant adaptations.</p>
