                    <h1>Canthium dicoccum var. impolitum</h1>
<p>Canthium dicoccum var. impolitum, commonly known as the rough-seeded hogweed, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its hairy foliage and robust growth make it a notable species in its native habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
