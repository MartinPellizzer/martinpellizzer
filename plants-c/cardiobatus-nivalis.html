                    <h1>Cardiobatus nivalis</h1>
<p>Cardiobatus nivalis, commonly known as the snow heart plant, is a rare alpine species characterized by its unique heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with low temperatures and limited sunlight. The plant's foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help insulate it from the cold. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are small and pale pink, often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
