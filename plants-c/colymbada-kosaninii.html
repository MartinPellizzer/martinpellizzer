<p>Colymbada kosaninii, commonly known as the Kosanin's colymbadine, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring.</p>
