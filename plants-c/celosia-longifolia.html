                    <h1>Celosia longifolia</h1>
<p>Celosia longifolia, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a tropical plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, feather-like bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with branching stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Celosia longifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
