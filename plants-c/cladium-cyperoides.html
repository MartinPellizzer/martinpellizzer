                    <h1>Cladium cyperoides</h1>
<p>Cladium cyperoides, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Sawgrass thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and prairies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland habitats.</p>
