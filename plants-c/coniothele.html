                    <h1>Coniothele</h1>
<p>Coniothele, commonly known as the "false truffle," is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tulasnellaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found in association with the roots of certain plants, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. They are saprophytic, meaning they decompose organic matter rather than forming symbiotic relationships with their hosts. Coniothele species are characterized by their small, irregularly shaped fruiting bodies and their ability to produce spores in a unique, often gelatinous structure.</p>
<p>Due to their cryptic nature and limited study, much remains to be learned about their ecological roles and taxonomic classification.</p>
