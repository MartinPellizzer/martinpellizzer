                    <h1>Claytonia salsoloides</h1>
<p>Claytonia salsoloides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms a dense mat of small, fleshy, green to grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Claytonia salsoloides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
