<p>Chlorocrepis staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically short-lived and appear in early spring. Its leaves are simple, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, sticky hairs that help deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
