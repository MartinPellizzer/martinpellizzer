                    <h1>Cactus spiriformis</h1>
<p>Cactus spiriformis, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique species native to specific arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiraling, columnar stems that grow in a helical pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area. The plant produces small, spiny flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus spiriformis is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
