<p>Craspedoneuron braunii, commonly known as the Braun's craspedoneuron, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Craspedoneuron braunii plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
