<p>Ceratophyllum platyacanthum, commonly known as the broad-needle watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has whorled leaves that are broad and flat, with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters. Ceratophyllum platyacanthum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and can contribute to water clarity by stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
