                    <h1>Cibotium guatemalense</h1>
<p>Cibotium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, fibrous root-like structures called rhizomes. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Cibotium guatemalense plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native ecosystems.</p>
