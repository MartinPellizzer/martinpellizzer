<p>Colema arenaria, commonly known as sand colema, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Colema arenaria is often found in dune habitats and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
