                    <h1>Cuscuta australis var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta australis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
