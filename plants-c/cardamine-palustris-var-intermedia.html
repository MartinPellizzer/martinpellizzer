<p>Cardamine palustris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate marsh cress, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette structure, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal racemes.
