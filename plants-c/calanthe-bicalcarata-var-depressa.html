                    <h1>Calanthe bicalcarata var. depressa</h1>
<p>Calanthe bicalcarata var. depressa, commonly known as the depressed calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful watering to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
