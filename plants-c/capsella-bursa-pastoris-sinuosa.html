The plant produces small, round, nut-like fruits called silicles, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions.</p>
