                    <h1>Cleistes hoehneana</h1>
<p>Cleistes hoehneana, commonly known as the Hoehne's cleistostoma, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. Native to the humid forests of Brazil, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its most notable feature is its unique, showy, bell-shaped flower that remains closed during the day, opening only at night.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
