                    <h1>Cassytha muelleri</h1>
<p>Cassytha muelleri, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in humid environments and is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
