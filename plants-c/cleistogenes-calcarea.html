                    <h1>Cleistogenes calcarea</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes calcarea, commonly known as the stone bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes calcarea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
