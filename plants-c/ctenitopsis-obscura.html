                    <h1>Ctenitopsis obscura</h1>
<p>Ctenitopsis obscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitopsis obscura is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
