<p>Catapodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers in spike-like clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Catapodium pauciflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
