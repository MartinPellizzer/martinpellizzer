                    <h1>Callitriche obtusangula f. submersa</h1>
<p>Callitriche obtusangula f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often submerged. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that float on the water surface, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to aquatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
