<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, though the variety isophyllum is distinguished by its smoother foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
