<p>Cheilanthes doniana, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to regions of Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
