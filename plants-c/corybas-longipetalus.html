                    <h1>Corybas longipetalus</h1>
<p>Corybas longipetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled helmet orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that sits atop a slender stem, which is often covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination by small insects, particularly flies, due to their strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Corybas longipetalus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest or swampy areas.</p>
