<p>Caucalis stolzii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems.</p>
<p>Caucalis stolzii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
