                    <h1>Corrigiola telephiifolia subvar. foliosa</h1>
<p>Corrigiola telephiifolia subvar. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
