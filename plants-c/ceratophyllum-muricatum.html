                    <h1>Ceratophyllum muricatum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum muricatum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in South America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for roots. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
