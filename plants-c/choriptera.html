                    <h1>Choriptera</h1>
<p>Choriptera, commonly known as the springtail, is a small hexapod insect belonging to the order Collembola.</p>
<p>These tiny creatures are often found in moist environments such as soil, leaf litter, and under stones. They are characterized by their elongated bodies and a unique appendage called the furcula, which allows them to jump. Choriptera play an important role in soil ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and decomposition.</p>
<p>Their presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats.</p>
