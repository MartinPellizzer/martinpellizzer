<p>Cyclosorus francoanus, commonly known as the Franco's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas with soft, muddy substrates. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, which are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus francoanus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
