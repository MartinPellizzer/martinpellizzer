                    <h1>Cypripedium spectabile var. album</h1>
<p>Cypripedium spectabile var. album, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of white, fragrant flowers that resemble a cascading veil. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted by their scent and color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
