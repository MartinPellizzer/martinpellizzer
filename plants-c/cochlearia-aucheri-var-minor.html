                    <h1>Cochlearia aucheri var. minor</h1>
<p>Cochlearia aucheri var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cochlearia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
