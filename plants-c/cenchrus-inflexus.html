                    <h1>Cenchrus inflexus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus inflexus, commonly known as the sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
