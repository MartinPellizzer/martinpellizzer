                    <h1>Chaenostoma titanophilum</h1>
<p>Chaenostoma titanophilum, commonly known as the giant water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, supporting a dense network of fine, branching roots. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight, often found in marshy areas and pond margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
