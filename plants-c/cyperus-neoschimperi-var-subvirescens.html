<p>Cyperus neoschimperi var. subvirescens, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.
