<p>Cucubalus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Cucubalus maritimus is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it a resilient species in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
