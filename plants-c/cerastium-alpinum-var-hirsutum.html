<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense, fuzzy foliage, which provides insulation against cold temperatures.</p>
