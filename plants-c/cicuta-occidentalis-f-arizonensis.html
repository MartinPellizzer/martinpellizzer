<p>Cicuta occidentalis f. arizonensis, commonly known as Arizona water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a toxic compound called cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands.</p>
