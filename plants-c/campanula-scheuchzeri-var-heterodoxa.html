                    <h1>Campanula scheuchzeri var. heterodoxa</h1>
<p>Campanula scheuchzeri var. heterodoxa, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
