                    <h1>Coryanthes angelantha</h1>
<p>Coryanthes angelantha, commonly known as the angel's crown, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate floral structures that resemble a crown, with a central spadix surrounded by a colorful perianth. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies and beetles. Its growth is epiphytic, meaning it thrives by growing on other plants without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Coryanthes angelantha make it a unique and visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
