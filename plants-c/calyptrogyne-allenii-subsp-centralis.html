<p>Calyptrogyne allenii subsp.</p>
<p>centralis, commonly known as the Central Islands mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
