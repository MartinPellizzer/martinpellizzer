                    <h1>Corybas calcicola</h1>
<p>Corybas calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola torch orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tubular-shaped flower that resembles a torch, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its growth is often limited to rocky outcrops and crevices, where it forms dense, compact clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
