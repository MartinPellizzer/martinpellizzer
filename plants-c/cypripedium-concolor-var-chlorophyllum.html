                    <h1>Cypripedium concolor var. chlorophyllum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium concolor var. chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and oval, and it produces a single, elongated flower stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
