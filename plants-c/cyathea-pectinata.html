                    <h1>Cyathea pectinata</h1>
<p>Cyathea pectinata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a layer of persistent, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant produces large, compound fronds with a distinctive pinnate structure, and its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the leaves. Cyathea pectinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
