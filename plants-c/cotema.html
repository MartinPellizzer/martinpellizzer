                    <h1>Cotema</h1>
<p>Cotema, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of rivers. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate. Cotema is noted for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for various aquatic life forms.</p>
<p>Its blooming cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, making it a symbol of resilience and renewal in Amazonian cultures.</p>
