                    <h1>Cuscuta deltoidea var. serrulata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta deltoidea var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
