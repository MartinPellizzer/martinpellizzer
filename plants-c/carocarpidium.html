                    <h1>Carocarpidium</h1>
<p>Carocarpidium, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking golden hue, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for spore dispersal. Carocarpidium thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to grow in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant.</p>
