<p>Chaetospora nana, commonly known as the dwarf chaetospora, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral thallus that is typically green or reddish in color.
