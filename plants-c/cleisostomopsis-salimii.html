                <h1>Cleisostomopsis salimii</h1>
<p>Cleisostomopsis salimii, commonly known as the Salimii's cleistostomopsis, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with its flowers being cleistogamous, meaning they self-pollinate without opening. It is native to specific regions in South Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleisostomopsis salimii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
