<p>Cirsium × controversum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. It is a sterile hybrid, resulting from the cross between Cirsium arvense and Cirsium vulgare.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
