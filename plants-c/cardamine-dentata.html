                <h1>Cardamine dentata</h1>
<p>Cardamine dentata, commonly known as the toothed water-crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, marshes, and woodland floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with finely serrated margins, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Cardamine dentata plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
