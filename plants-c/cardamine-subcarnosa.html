                    <h1>Cardamine subcarnosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine subcarnosa, commonly known as narrowleaf water-crowfoot, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers are often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
