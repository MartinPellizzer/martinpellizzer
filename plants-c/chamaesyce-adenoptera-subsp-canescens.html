<p>canescens, commonly known as the hairy sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and adaptive growth form make it well-suited for survival in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
