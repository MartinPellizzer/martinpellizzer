                    <h1>Crassula caffraria</h1>
<p>Crassula caffraria, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red during the warmer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Crassula caffraria is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun conditions.</p>
