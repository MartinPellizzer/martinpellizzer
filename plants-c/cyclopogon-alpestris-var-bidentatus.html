<p>Cyclopogon alpestris var. bidentatus, commonly known as the alpine cyclopogon, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its modest appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
