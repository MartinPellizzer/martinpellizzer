                    <h1>Crocus nivalis</h1>
<p>Crocus nivalis, commonly known as the snow crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces showy, early spring flowers with bright yellow petals and a central staminode that resembles a tongue. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas where it blooms before the snow has fully melted. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, allowing it to emerge quickly in the spring.</p>
<p>The snow crocus is an important early pollinator attractor and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens.</p>
