<p>Cystacanthus, commonly known as the parasitic fluke, is a type of trematode that belongs to the class Digenea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex life cycle, which typically involves intermediate hosts such as snails and definitive hosts like mammals. The adult fluke attaches to the host's intestinal wall using a muscular pharynx and a ventral sucker. Its body is covered with a cuticle and possesses a branched excretory system.</p>
<p>Cystacanthus is primarily found in freshwater environments and is known for its role in parasitic infections in various animal species.</p>
