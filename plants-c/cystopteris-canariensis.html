<p>Cystopteris canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands water fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Cystopteris canariensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
