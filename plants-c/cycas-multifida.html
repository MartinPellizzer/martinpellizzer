                    <h1>Cycas multifida</h1>
<p>Cycas multifida, commonly known as the multifid cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately divided leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
