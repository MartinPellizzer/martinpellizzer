<p>Carex × microstachya f. supercanescens, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species that exhibits silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine pubescence on its leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is native to parts of North America.
