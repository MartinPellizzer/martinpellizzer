                            <h1>Cota Fulvida</h1>
<p>Cotula fulvida, scientifically known as Cota fulvida, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its modest appearance, Cotula fulvida plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
