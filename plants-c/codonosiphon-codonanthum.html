                    <h1>Codonosiphon codonanthum</h1>
<p>Codonosiphon codonanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that relies entirely on its host for survival. It is often found in agricultural areas where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a challenging weed to manage in natural and cultivated ecosystems.</p>
