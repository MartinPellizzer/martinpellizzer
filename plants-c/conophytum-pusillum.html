<p>Conophytum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a small succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Conophytum pusillum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
