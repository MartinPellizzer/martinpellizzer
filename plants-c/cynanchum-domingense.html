                <h1>Cynanchum domingense</h1>
<p>Cynanchum domingense, commonly known as the Dominican milkweed, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, like that of many milkweeds, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cynanchum domingense is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
