                    <h1>Carex longirostris</h1>
<p>Carex longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex longirostris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
