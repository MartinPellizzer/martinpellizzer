                    <h1>Cardia fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Cardia fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, brush-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh coastal environments.</p>
