<p>Cristaria univittata, commonly known as the single-striped water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a single, distinct white stripe running along the central vein. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often during the day. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Cristaria univittata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
