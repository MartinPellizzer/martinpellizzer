                    <h1>Cypripedium × weidlichianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × weidlichianum, commonly known as the Weidlich's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, moist habitats. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it is often found growing in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
