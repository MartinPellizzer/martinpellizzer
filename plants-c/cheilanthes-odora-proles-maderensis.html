                    <h1>Cheilanthes odora proles maderensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes odora proles maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's fragrant rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is named for its faintly aromatic scent, which is most noticeable when the fronds are crushed.</p>
