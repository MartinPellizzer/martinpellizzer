<p>Cynoglossum nervosum var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petiolate heartleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a hairy stem, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
