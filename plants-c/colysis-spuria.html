                    <h1>Colysis spuria</h1>
<p>Colysis spuria, commonly known as the false coltsfoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and appear in the spring.</p>
<p>Colysis spuria is often mistaken for true coltsfoot due to similar leaf structures, but it lacks the distinctive hairy stems of the latter.</p>
