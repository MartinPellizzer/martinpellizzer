                    <h1>Campanula leucantha</h1>
<p>Campanula leucantha, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers with a delicate, waxy texture. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, early summer blooms.</p>
