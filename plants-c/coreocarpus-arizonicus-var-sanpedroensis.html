<p>Coreocarpus arizonicus var. sanpedroensis, commonly known as San Pedro prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruit, which is typically pear-shaped and covered in small spines. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-arid climates.</p>
