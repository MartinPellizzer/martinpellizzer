<p>Claoxylon oligandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
