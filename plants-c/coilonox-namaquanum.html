                    <h1>Coilonox namaquanum</h1>
<p>Coilonox namaquanum, commonly known as the Namibian starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Coilonox namaquanum is a striking example of botanical adaptation to extreme desert conditions.</p>
