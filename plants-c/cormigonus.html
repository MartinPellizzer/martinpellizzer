                    <h1>Cormigonus</h1>
<p>Cormigonus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant characterized by its corm-like structure, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, the cormigonus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
