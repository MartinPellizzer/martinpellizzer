<p>Cissus woodii, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cissus woodii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
