                    <h1>Calligonum flavidum var. membranaceum</h1>
<p>Calligonum flavidum var. membranaceum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
