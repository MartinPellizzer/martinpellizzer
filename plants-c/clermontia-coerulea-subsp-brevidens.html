<p>Clermontia coerulea subsp.</p>
<p>brevidens, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas.</p>
<p>The plant features showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
