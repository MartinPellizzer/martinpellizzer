<p>Colpodium lakium, commonly known as the Lakium bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Colpodium lakium is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival.</p>
