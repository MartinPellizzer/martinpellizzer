                    <h1>Coptosapelta flavescens var. dongnaiensis</h1>
<p>Coptosapelta flavescens var. dongnaiensis, commonly known as the Dong Nai golden fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, golden-yellow fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountainous forests or along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in compact, spore-producing clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
