                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora var. subnuda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on agricultural crops such as corn and soybeans. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection to the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.</p>
