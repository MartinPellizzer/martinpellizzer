                    <h1>Cervicina undulata</h1>
<p>Cervicina undulata, commonly known as the wavy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Cervicina undulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
