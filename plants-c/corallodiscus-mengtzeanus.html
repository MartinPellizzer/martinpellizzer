<p>Corallodiscus mengtzeanus, commonly known as the Mengtzean coral disk, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Characellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and the presence of calcareous structures that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant is primarily found in freshwater environments, particularly in regions with soft water and moderate temperatures. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with distinct male and female gametes that contribute to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
