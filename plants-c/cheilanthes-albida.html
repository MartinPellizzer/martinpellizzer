                    <h1>Cheilanthes albida</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes albida, commonly known as the white-stemmed rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky crevices and dry soils, showcasing a unique adaptation to harsh environments. The plant has slender, pale green fronds with a distinctive white midrib, which helps in reflecting sunlight and reducing water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes albida is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
