                    <h1>Ctenitopsis gurupahensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitopsis gurupahensis, commonly known as the Gurupahensis fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
