                    <h1>Chorispora bungeana var. pilosula</h1>
<p>Chorispora bungeana var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy chorispora, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense foliage and compact growth form, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
