                    <h1>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the decurrenti-alata form of Cornopteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate fronds that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical form. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and dappled sunlight.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
