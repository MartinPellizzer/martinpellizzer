<p>Crinum graciliflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered crinum, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in umbels at the top of tall, slender stems. These flowers bloom during the warm seasons, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Crinum graciliflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
