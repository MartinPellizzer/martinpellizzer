                    <h1>Coffea benghalensis var. bababudanii</h1>
<p>Coffea benghalensis var. bababudanii, commonly known as Bababudan coffee, is a rare and unique variant of the coffee plant native to the southern Indian state of Karnataka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated red berries that are typically harvested by hand due to their delicate nature. The plant thrives in the humid, tropical climate of the Western Ghats, where it grows at high altitudes. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the plant produces a distinct, mild flavor profile with hints of citrus and floral notes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation and specific growing conditions, Bababudan coffee is considered a specialty and highly sought after in the global coffee market.</p>
