<p>Chaetochloa lachnea, commonly known as silky hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
