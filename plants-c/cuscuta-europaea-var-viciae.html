                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. viciae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. viciae, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on legumes such as vetch, which is reflected in its botanical name. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
