                    <h1>Cyperus semiangulatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus semiangulatus, commonly known as the narrow-angled flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its ability to colonize water bodies and compete with native vegetation.</p>
