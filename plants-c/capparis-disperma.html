<p>Capparis disperma, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Capparis disperma is well adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
