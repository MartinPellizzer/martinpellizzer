<p>Caleana parvula, commonly known as the dwarf hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hooded flower that resembles a bee, a feature that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance of an insect. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive hooded labellum that shelters the reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Caleana parvula is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
