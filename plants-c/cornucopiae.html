                    <h1>Cornucopiae</h1>
<p>Cornucopiae, commonly known as the horn of plenty, is a symbolic plant often associated with abundance and prosperity.</p>
<p>It is not a real botanical species but rather a symbolic representation used in art and literature. The imagery of the cornucopia typically features a curved horn filled with fruits, grains, and flowers, symbolizing a bountiful harvest. In some mythological contexts, it is said to have originated from the horn of the goat Amalthea, who nursed the infant Zeus.</p>
<p>While not a real plant, its visual elements draw inspiration from various real flora, including grapes, figs, and wheat.</p>
