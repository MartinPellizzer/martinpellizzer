<p>Clastilix mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Clastilix mexicana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is often grown from seed due to its difficulty in propagation.</p>
