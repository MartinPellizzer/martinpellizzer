                    <h1>Coccoloba macrantha</h1>
<p>Coccoloba macrantha, commonly known as the broadleaf spinach or red mangrove, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in brackish or saline wetlands. Coccoloba macrantha is adapted to tidal zones and can tolerate periodic submersion, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for erosion control in mangrove areas.</p>
