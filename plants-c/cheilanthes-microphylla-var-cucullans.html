                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. cucullans</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. cucullans, commonly known as the hooded rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>
