<p>Chilenia heteracantha, commonly known as the Chilean thornapple, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berry-like fruits containing toxic alkaloids. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with serrated edges and a woody structure that helps it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a potential ornamental plant in some regions.</p>
