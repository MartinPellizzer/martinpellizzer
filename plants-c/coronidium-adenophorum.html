<p>Coronidium adenophorum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Coronidium adenophorum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for nutrient acquisition.</p>
