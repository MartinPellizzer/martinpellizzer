                    <h1>Cypripedium argus var. moensii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium argus var. moensii, commonly known as the Moensii Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink and white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
