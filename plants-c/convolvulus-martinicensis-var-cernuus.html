                    <h1>Convolvulus martinicensis var. cernuus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus martinicensis var. cernuus, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ground cover and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name.</p>
