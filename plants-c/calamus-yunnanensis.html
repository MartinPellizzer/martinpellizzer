                    <h1>Calamus yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Calamus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, particularly the Yunnan province, and is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Calamus yunnanensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse flora of Southeast Asia.</p>
