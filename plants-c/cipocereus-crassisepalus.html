<p>Cipocereus crassisepalus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It has spiny areoles, which are clusters of spines, hairs, and flowers, typical of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts.</p>
