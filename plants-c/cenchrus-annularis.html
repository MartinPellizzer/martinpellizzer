<p>Cenchrus annularis, commonly known as the ringgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive ring-shaped nodes along the stems, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Cenchrus annularis is used in some regions for forage and has ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
