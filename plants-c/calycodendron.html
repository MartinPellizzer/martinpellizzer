                    <h1>Calycodendron</h1>
<p>Calycodendron, commonly known as the "kapok tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate or bipinnate, and its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature that aids in its propagation. Calycodendron species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and others for their ecological roles in their native environments.</p>
