<p>Cyathea arborea var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its fronds are sometimes harvested for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The varietal name *nigrescens* refers to the darkening of the trunk with age, a distinctive feature of this plant.</p>
