                    <h1>Caltha crenata</h1>
<p>Caltha crenata, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize moist, shaded environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caltha crenata is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland floors where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
