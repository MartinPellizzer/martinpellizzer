<p>Callitriche oryzetorum, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in groups of three, and it is often found in association with other aquatic plants.</p>
<p>Callitriche oryzetorum plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
