<p>Caralluma sacculata, commonly known as the Hooded Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically green and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma sacculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
