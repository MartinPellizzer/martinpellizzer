                    <h1>Conocarpus erectus var. sericeus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus erectus var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white, hair-like structures on the stems and leaves, which provide a unique appearance and aid in reducing water loss. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense mangrove forests that stabilize shorelines. Its leaves are small, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps it withstand saline conditions.</p>
<p>The silky mangrove plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
