<p>Chenopodium microphyllum var. desertorum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers in compact clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
