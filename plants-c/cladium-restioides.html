                    <h1>Cladium restioides</h1>
<p>Cladium restioides, commonly known as the mangrove cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, grass-like foliage and ability to tolerate high salinity levels. The plant forms dense underwater stands, contributing to the structural complexity of mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize sediments, preventing erosion in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Cladium restioides plays a vital role in the ecological balance of wetland habitats.</p>
