                    <h1>Carex fusca var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Carex fusca var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often in dunes or salt marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important pioneer species in dune stabilization.</p>
