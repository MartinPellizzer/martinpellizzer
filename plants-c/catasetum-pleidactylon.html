<p>Catasetum pleidactylon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal coating, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Catasetum pleidactylon is also notable for its unique pollination mechanism, involving specialized structures that facilitate the transfer of pollen to specific pollinators.</p>
