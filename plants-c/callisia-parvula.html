<p>Callisia parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Callisia parvula is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
