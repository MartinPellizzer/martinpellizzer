                    <h1>Conanthus sericeus</h1>
<p>Conanthus sericeus, commonly known as the silverleaf conanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance and aiding in water conservation.</p>
<p>Conanthus sericeus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
