<p>Callista tenella, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Callista tenella plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds.</p>
