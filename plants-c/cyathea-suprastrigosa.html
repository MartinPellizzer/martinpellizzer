                    <h1>Cyathea suprastrigosa</h1>
<p>Cyathea suprastrigosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer. The plant produces large, compound fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Cyathea suprastrigosa is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
