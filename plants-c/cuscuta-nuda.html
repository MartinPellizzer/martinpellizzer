                    <h1>Cuscuta nuda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta nuda, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is often found on crops such as beans, corn, and sunflowers, making it an agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Cuscuta nuda is widely distributed across temperate regions and can be a challenging weed to control in farmland.</p>
