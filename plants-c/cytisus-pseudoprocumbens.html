<p>Cytisus pseudoprocumbens, commonly known as the creeping yellow rosemary, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and aromatic, resembling those of rosemary.</p>
<p>Cytisus pseudoprocumbens is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
