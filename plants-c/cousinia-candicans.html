<p>Cousinia candicans, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically low and mat-forming, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia candicans is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
