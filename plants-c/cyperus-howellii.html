<p>Cyperus howellii, commonly known as Howell's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Cyperus howellii is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
