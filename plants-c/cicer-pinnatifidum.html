                    <h1>Cicer pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Cicer pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Cicer pinnatifidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
