<p>Conium royenii, commonly known as the Royal hemlock, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, compound leaves that resemble those of hemlock. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in cultivation despite its ornamental appeal.</p>
