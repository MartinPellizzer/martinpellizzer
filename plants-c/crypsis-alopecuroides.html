                    <h1>Crypsis alopecuroides</h1>
<p>Crypsis alopecuroides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptive traits, it is often found in rocky or disturbed soils where it thrives in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
