<p>Campylotropis luhitensis, commonly known as the Luhitensis climbing clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
