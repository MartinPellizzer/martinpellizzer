                    <h1>Coryphantha muehlbaueriana</h1>
<p>Coryphantha muehlbaueriana, commonly known as the Muehlbauer's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert life, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan.</p>
