<p>Chorispora exscapa, commonly known as the slender sandstem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Chorispora exscapa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
