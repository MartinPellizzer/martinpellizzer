                    <h1>Cameraria dubia</h1>
<p>Cameraria dubia, commonly known as the cherry fruit tortrix moth, is a small leaf-mining moth native to Europe.</p>
<p>Its larvae feed on the leaves of Prunus species, including cherries, plums, and peaches, causing visible damage by creating serpentine mines. The adult moth has a wingspan of about 10-12 mm, with grayish-brown wings patterned with dark markings. The life cycle involves several generations per year, with larvae completing development within the leaf tissue.</p>
<p>This pest is a significant concern in orchards due to its ability to reduce fruit quality and yield.</p>
