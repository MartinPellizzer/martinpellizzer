                    <h1>Crassula tomentosa</h1>
<p>Crassula tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape, often forming a rosette pattern. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Crassula tomentosa is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
