                    <h1>Charlwoodia australis</h1>
<p>Charlwoodia australis, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species and is protected in several Australian states.</p>
