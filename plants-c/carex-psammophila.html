                    <h1>Carex psammophila</h1>
<p>Carex psammophila, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, Carex psammophila plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
