                    <h1>Coptosperma mitochondrioides</h1>
<p>Coptosperma mitochondrioides, commonly known as the mitochondrial sedge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique mitochondrial genome, which has provided insights into plant evolutionary genetics.</p>
