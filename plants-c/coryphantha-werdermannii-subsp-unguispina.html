<p>Coryphantha werdermannii subsp.</p>
<p>unguispina, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive red or pinkish coloration on its areoles, which are the specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its spines are typically short and white, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
