<p>Cereus chiloensis var. zizkaanus, commonly known as the Zizka's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the coastal regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
