<p>Colubrina glandulosa subsp.</p>
<p>antillana, commonly known as the Antillean bluestem, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt spray and wind.</p>
