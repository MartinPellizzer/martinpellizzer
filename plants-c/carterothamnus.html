                    <h1>Carterothamnus</h1>
<p>Carterothamnus, commonly known as the desert thorn or desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees with woody stems and spiny branches, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or reddish and attract pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Carterothamnus species play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
