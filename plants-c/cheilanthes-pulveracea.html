                    <h1>Cheilanthes pulveracea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes pulveracea, commonly known as the rock spurge or desert fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are typically small and clustered. It is often found growing on limestone or granite surfaces, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
