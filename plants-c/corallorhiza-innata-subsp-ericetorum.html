<p>Corallorhiza innata subsp.</p>
<p>ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a root-parasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and typically grows in acidic, wooded environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect stem with a dense cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in association with ericaceous shrubs such as heather and blueberry.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
