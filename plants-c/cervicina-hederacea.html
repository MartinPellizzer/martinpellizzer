<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
