<p>Cyathodes colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's cyathodes, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its distinctive floral structures called cyathodes, which are cup-like clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
