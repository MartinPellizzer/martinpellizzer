<p>Cieca porophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant found in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky crevices or under dense forest canopies. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered fronds that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cieca porophylla is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
