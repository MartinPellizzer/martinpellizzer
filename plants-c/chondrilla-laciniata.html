                    <h1>Chondrilla laciniata</h1>
<p>Chondrilla laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert bush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Chondrilla laciniata is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
