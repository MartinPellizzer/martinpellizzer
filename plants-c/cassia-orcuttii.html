                    <h1>Cassia orcuttii</h1>
<p>Cassia orcuttii, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Cassia orcuttii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
