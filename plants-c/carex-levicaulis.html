                    <h1>Carex levicaulis</h1>
<p>Carex levicaulis, commonly known as the slender flat-sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex levicaulis is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian habitats.</p>
