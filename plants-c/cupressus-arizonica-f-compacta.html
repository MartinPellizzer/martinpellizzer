<p>Cupressus arizonica f. compacta, commonly known as the Apache Creek cypress, is a dense, shrub-like form of the Arizona cypress.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its cones are small and resemble those of other cypress species, contributing to its ecological and horticultural value.</p>
