                    <h1>Cousinia fragilis</h1>
<p>Cousinia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of silver-gray foliage and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Cousinia fragilis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
