The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
