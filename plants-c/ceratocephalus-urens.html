                    <h1>Ceratocephalus urens</h1>
<p>Ceratocephalus urens, commonly known as the sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that produces small, spiky fruits known as burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its persistent seed production and aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
