<p>Caryophyllus corticosus, commonly known as the rough-hair sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rugged stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine, rough hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caryophyllus corticosus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
