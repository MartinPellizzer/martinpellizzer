<p>Calypso bulbosa var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
