                            <h1>Citrus × Tachibana</h1>
<p>Tachibana orange, scientifically known as Citrus × tachibana, is a unique citrus fruit native to southern Japan. It is often mistaken for a mandarin or kumquat due to its small size and sweet flavor. This fruit has been cultivated for centuries and holds cultural significance in Japanese history. Its peel is used in traditional medicine, while the fruit itself is prized for its juiciness and aromatic taste. Despite its popularity, it remains relatively unknown outside of East Asia.</p>
