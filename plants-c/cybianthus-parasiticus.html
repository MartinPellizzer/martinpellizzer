                    <h1>Cybianthus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Cybianthus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic bellflower, is a flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic traits, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as trees or shrubs, and forms a symbiotic relationship with its host. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its haustoria to absorb nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>Cybianthus parasiticus is found in various regions with suitable host plants and is often associated with moist, shaded environments.</p>
