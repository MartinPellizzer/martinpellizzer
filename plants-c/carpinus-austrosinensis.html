                    <h1>Carpinus austrosinensis</h1>
<p>Carpinus austrosinensis, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are solitary and appear later on the same tree. Its fruits are small, winged samaras that disperse via wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>The tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive form and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
