<p>Cousinia pergamacea subsp.</p>
<p>pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment couchgrass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in inflorescences called panicles. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry environments, and it is adapted to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rocky or dry garden settings.</p>
