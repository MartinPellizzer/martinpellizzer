                    <h1>Campylotropis cytisoides</h1>
<p>Campylotropis cytisoides, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and lack of true leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and evolution.</p>
