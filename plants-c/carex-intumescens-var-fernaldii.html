                    <h1>Carex intumescens var. fernaldii</h1>
<p>Carex intumescens var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
