<p>Cestichis leptopus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, where it can thrive in both still and gently flowing habitats. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually pink or white in color.</p>
<p>Cestichis leptopus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
