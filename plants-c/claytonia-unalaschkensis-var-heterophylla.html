                    <h1>Claytonia unalaschkensis var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Claytonia unalaschkensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Alaska pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its cold and often arid environment. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are short and often leafless.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to lanceolate, contributing to its taxonomic complexity.</p>
