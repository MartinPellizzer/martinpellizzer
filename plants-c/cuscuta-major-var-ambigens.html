<p>Cuscuta major var. ambigens, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is commonly found in agricultural areas where it infests crops such as corn and soybeans.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants.</p>
