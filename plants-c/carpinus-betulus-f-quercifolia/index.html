<p>European hornbeam, scientifically known as Carpinus betulus f. quercifolia, is a unique and striking variant of the hornbeam tree native to Europe. This cultivar is distinguished by its broad, leaf-like foliage that resembles oak leaves, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits. The tree's dense canopy provides shelter for wildlife, while its hardy nature makes it suitable for urban landscapes. With its historical significance and adaptability, the European hornbeam remains a valued plant in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
