<p>Ceropegia articulata subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the Arctic moonvine, is a succulent plant native to northern regions of North America. It features trailing stems with opposite, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
