<p>Chlorocyathus lobulata, commonly known as the yellow cyathus, is a unique species of cup-shaped fungus that belongs to the family Cyathaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow color and a distinctive, cup-like structure that houses its spore-producing organs. This fungus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or leaf litter. Its morphology includes a central stalk with a saucer-shaped cap, and it is known for its short lifespan, often appearing and disappearing quickly in the forest floor.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter and supporting microbial communities in its habitat.</p>
