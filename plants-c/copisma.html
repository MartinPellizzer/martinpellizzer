                    <h1>Copisma</h1>
<p>Copisma, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and bogs, where they thrive in moist, acidic soils. Copisma species are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often violet or purple-colored flowers. They have a complex root system that helps them anchor in waterlogged conditions and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each adapted to different moisture levels and geographic regions within their native habitats.</p>
