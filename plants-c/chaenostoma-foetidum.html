<p>Chaenostoma foetidum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow, slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Despite its unpleasant odor, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
