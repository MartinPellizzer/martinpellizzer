<p>Cereus lepidanthus, commonly known as the silver crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance characterized by its white, woolly spines and a crown of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are pollinated by bats and moths, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
