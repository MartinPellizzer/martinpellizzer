<p>Cynosurus coeruleus, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit.

Its slender, erect stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Cynosurus coeruleus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
