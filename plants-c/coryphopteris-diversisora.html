<p>Coryphopteris diversisora, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Coryphopteris diversisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
