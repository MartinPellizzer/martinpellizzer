                    <h1>Cheilanthes cucullans</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes cucullans, commonly known as the hooded rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety indumentum. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes cucullans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
