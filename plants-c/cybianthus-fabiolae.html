<p>Cybianthus fabiolae, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small cups, which are composed of numerous tiny, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cybianthus fabiolae is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
