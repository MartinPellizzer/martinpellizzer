                    <h1>Coelorachis selloana</h1>
<p>Coelorachis selloana, commonly known as the Sello's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, clustered inflorescence consists of delicate, spurred flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
