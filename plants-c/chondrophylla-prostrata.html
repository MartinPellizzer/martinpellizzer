<p>Chondrophylla prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate chondrophylla, is a low-growing flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces copious amounts of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
