                    <h1>Castanopsis cuspidata f. aurescens</h1>
<p>Castanopsis cuspidata f. aurescens, commonly known as the golden-leaf chinquapin, is a variant of the chinquapin tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the species. The plant is a deciduous evergreen, meaning it sheds its leaves seasonally but retains some foliage year-round. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
