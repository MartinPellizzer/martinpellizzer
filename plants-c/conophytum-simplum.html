<p>Conophytum simplum, commonly known as the "Simplified Coneplant," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, which help minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Conophytum simplum is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
