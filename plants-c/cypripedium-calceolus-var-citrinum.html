                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. citrinum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. citrinum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
