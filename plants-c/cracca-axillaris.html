<p>Cracca axillaris, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Cracca axillaris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
