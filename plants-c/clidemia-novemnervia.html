                    <h1>Clidemia novemnervia</h1>
<p>Clidemia novemnervia, commonly known as the nine-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
