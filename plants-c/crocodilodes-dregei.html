                    <h1>Crocodilodes dregei</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes dregei, commonly known as the African crocodile fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
