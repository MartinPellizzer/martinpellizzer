<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually floating or submersed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum plays a role in water purification by filtering out impurities and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
