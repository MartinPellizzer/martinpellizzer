                    <h1>Coryphantha sneedii var. leei</h1>
<p>Coryphantha sneedii var. leei, commonly known as the Sneed's ghostplant, is a rare and endemic cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spineless stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
