                            <h1>Carduus Defloratus Var. Glaucus</h1>
<p>Glaucous thistle, scientifically known as Carduus defloratus var. glaucus, is a striking plant native to the grasslands and open areas of eastern North America. Its most notable feature is its silvery-blue foliage, which reflects light and gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, spiny stems topped with purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. Despite its sharp thorns, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. However, it is also considered a noxious weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
