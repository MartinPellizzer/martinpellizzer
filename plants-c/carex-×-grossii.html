<p>Carex × grossii, commonly known as the hybrid sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex appressa and Carex brevifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
