                    <h1>Carex distentiformis</h1>
<p>Carex distentiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex distentiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local wildlife.</p>
