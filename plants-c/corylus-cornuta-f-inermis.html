                    <h1>Corylus cornuta f. inermis</h1>
<p>Corylus cornuta f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless nut shells, distinguishing it from the more commonly cultivated European hazelnut. The plant produces small, deciduous leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The smooth hazelnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts, which are smaller and less commonly harvested than those of other hazelnut varieties.</p>
