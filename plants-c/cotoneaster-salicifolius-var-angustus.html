<p>Cotoneaster salicifolius var. angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip and a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and persistent berries, which add visual interest throughout the year.</p>
