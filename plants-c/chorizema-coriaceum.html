                    <h1>Chorizema coriaceum</h1>
<p>Chorizema coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf cholla, is a succulent plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny joints that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Chorizema coriaceum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils.</p>
