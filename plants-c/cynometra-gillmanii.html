                    <h1>Cynometra gillmanii</h1>
<p>Cynometra gillmanii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
