<p>Catasetum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendant, showy flowers that hang from the stems, often in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers typically feature a distinctive labellum that is modified for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Catasetum pendulum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
