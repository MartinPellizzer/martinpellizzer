                    <h1>Cephalomanes javanicum var. asplenioides</h1>
<p>Cephalomanes javanicum var. asplenioides, commonly known as the Javanese shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
