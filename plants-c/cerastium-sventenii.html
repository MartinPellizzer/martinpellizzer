<p>Cerastium sventenii, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its clustered stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Cerastium sventenii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
