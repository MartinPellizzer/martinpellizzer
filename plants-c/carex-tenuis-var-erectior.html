<p>Carex tenuis var. erectior, commonly known as slender sedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. This variety is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
