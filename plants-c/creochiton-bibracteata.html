                <h1>Creochiton bibracteata</h1>
<p>Creochiton bibracteata, commonly known as the two-bracted creosote beetle, is a species of leaf beetle native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy exoskeleton and the presence of two prominent bracts on its body. The plant it feeds on, creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), is a drought-tolerant shrub with small, resinous leaves. Creochiton bibracteata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding and life cycle.</p>
<p>Its botanical associations highlight the intricate relationships between insects and their host plants in arid environments.</p>
