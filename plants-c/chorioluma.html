                    <h1>Chorioluma</h1>
<p>Chorioluma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense, white, spongy tissue called a mycelium. Chorioluma produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas such as the Florida scrub and pine rocklands.</p>
