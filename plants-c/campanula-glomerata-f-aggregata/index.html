<p>Campanula glomerata f. aggregata is a unique variation of the bellflower plant known for its dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. This compact form thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that add visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in gardens. It serves as a valuable food source for pollinators and contributes to biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>
