                    <h1>Camptorrhiza junodii</h1>
<p>Camptorrhiza junodii, commonly known as the Junod's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, rocky habitats. The plant is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. Its tuberous roots store nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camptorrhiza junodii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
