                    <h1>Cereus articulatus</h1>
<p>Cereus articulatus, commonly known as the Articulated Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems that allow for efficient water storage and reduce surface area for evaporation. The plant typically grows in a sprawling or upright form, with a branching structure that enables it to spread across rocky or sandy terrain. Its flowers are large, white, and often fragrant, blooming at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptations to desert conditions make it a resilient and visually striking member of the cactus family.</p>
