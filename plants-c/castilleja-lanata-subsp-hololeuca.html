<p>Castilleja lanata subsp.</p>
<p>hololeuca, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants.</p>
