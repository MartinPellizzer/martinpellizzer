<p>Cephalophyllum cupreum, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its vivid copper-colored leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
