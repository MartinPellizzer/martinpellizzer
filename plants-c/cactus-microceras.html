                    <h1>Cactus microceras</h1>
<p>Cactus microceras, commonly known as the small-cactus or microceras cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly after rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
