                    <h1>Cistanche allochroa</h1>
<p>Cistanche allochroa, commonly known as the yellow parasitic wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a branched, yellowish stem covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
