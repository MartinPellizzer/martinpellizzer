<p>Ctenopteris pendula, commonly known as the hanging sea fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that dangle from its rhizomes, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the coast, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its unique aesthetic.</p>
