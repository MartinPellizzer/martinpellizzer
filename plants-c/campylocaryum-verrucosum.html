                    <h1>Campylocaryum verrucosum</h1>
<p>Campylocaryum verrucosum, commonly known as the roughleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged, branching fronds that are covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often anchored to substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in aquatic gardens for its unique appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
