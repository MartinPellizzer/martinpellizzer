                    <h1>Citrus × lycopersiciformis</h1>
<p>Citrus × lycopersiciformis, commonly known as the hybrid tomato-citrus plant, is a rare and intriguing botanical hybrid that combines traits of both citrus and tomato plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, and exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. The plant typically produces small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble both citrus fruits and tomatoes in appearance. Its unique morphology and genetic makeup make it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticultural experimentation.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes but is occasionally grown in specialized gardens or research settings.</p>
