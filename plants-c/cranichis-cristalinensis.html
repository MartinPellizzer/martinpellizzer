<p>Cranichis cristalinensis, commonly known as the cristaline orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
