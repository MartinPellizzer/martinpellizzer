<p>Carex stenolepis f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex stenolepis species, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more slender leaves compared to the typical form of the species.</p>
