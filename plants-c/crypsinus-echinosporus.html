                    <h1>Crypsinus echinosporus</h1>
<p>Crypsinus echinosporus, commonly known as the spiny-seed crypton, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that encase its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
