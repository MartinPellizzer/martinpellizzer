<p>Ceriops timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant adaptations, which allow it to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically small and革质 (leathery), which reduces water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Ceriops timoriensis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
