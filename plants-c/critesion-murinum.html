<p>Critesion murinum, commonly known as the mouse ear cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, fleshy leaves that resemble a mouse's ears, hence its common name.

<p>Critesion murinum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it both a common weed and a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
