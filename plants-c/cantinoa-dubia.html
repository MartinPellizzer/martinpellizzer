<p>Cantinoa dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is highly endangered and difficult to cultivate.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and delicate species.</p>
