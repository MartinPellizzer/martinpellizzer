                    <h1>Cousinia caespitosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, forming low, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Cousinia caespitosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited water availability.</p>
