<p>Coccothrinax clarensis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and broad, palmate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
