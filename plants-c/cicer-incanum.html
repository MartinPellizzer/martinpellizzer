                    <h1>Cicer incanum</h1>
<p>Cicer incanum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used as a cover crop or forage due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
