                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. calycina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. calycina, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
