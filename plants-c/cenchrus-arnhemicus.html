                    <h1>Cenchrus arnhemicus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus arnhemicus, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to colonize disturbed soils and stabilize sandy or rocky landscapes.</p>
<p>Cenchrus arnhemicus plays an important role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
