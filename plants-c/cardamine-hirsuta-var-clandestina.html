                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta var. clandestina</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. clandestina, commonly known as the secretive water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, preferring nutrient-rich, muddy substrates. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often protected under conservation efforts to prevent habitat loss.</p>
