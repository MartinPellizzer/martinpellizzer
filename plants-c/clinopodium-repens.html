<p>Clinopodium repens, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and emit a mint-like aroma when crushed. Its flowers are tiny, tubular, and typically clustered in spikes, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Clinopodium repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
