                    <h1>Cuscuta kotschyana var. caudata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kotschyana var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts. The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it commonly infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a significant agricultural concern.</p>
