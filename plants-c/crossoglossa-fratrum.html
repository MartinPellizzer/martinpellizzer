                    <h1>Crossoglossa fratrum</h1>
<p>Crossoglossa fratrum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Himalayas, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in late summer, often surrounded by thick, waxy leaves that help it float on water. The plant thrives in still, nutrient-rich waters and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude climate. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the lakebed, while its leaves are often covered in a layer of fine hair.</p>
<p>Crossoglossa fratrum is not only a botanical curiosity but also holds cultural significance in local traditions.</p>
