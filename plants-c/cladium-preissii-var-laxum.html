                    <h1>Cladium preissii var. laxum</h1>
<p>Cladium preissii var. laxum, commonly known as the soft spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fibrous leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that produce small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
