                    <h1>Caroxylon laricinum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon laricinum, commonly known as the larch pine, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden in the fall, and its distinctive cones that mature to release seeds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in its ecosystem. Botanically, it belongs to the Pinaceae family and is closely related to other members of the larch genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon laricinum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
