<p>Cicca geraesensis, commonly known as the Geraes Mountain cicca, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cicca geraesensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
