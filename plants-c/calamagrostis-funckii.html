                    <h1>Calamagrostis funckii</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis funckii, commonly known as the Funck's reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with fine, silver-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, arranged in panicles that rise above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats.</p>
