<p>Carpogymnia jessoensis, commonly known as the Jesso lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forested areas, particularly in East Asia. The thallus is pale yellow to greenish in color, with a finely granular texture. It lacks distinct medulla and has a well-developed cortex.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in humid, shaded environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
