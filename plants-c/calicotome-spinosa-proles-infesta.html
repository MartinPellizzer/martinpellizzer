                    <h1>Calicotome spinosa proles infesta</h1>
<p>Calicotome spinosa proles infesta, commonly known as the Portuguese thorn or Portuguese acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Portugal and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal and semi-arid environments.</p>
