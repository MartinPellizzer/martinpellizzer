                    <h1>Cytisus tournefortianus</h1>
<p>Cytisus tournefortianus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, thorned stems and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both a useful pioneer plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
