                    <h1>Cephalanthera longifolia</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy, greenish-white flower with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera longifolia is known for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
