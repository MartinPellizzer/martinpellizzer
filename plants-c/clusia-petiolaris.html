<p>Clusia petiolaris, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
