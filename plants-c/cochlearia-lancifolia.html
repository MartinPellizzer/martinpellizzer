<p>Cochlearia lancifolia, commonly known as the lancolate cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cochlearia lancifolia is an important species for local biodiversity and is often found in specialized conservation areas.</p>
