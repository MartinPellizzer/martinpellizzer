                    <h1>Corysanthes epiphytica</h1>
<p>Corysanthes epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It grows on the trunks and branches of trees, using them for physical support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, spider-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
