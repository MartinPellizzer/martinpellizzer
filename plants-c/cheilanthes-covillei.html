                    <h1>Cheilanthes covillei</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes covillei, commonly known as the Coville's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes covillei is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves.</p>
