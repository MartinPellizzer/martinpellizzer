                    <h1>Christisonia stocksii</h1>
<p>Christisonia stocksii, commonly known as the Stocks' Christisonia, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, daisy-like blooms that are often visited by native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Christisonia stocksii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
