<p>Coryanthes minima, commonly known as the miniature coryanthe, is a small orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Coryanthes minima plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
