<p>Cranichis tovariana, commonly known as the Tovar's spider orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
