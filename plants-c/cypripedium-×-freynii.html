<p>Cypripedium × freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, typically ranging in color from white to pink or yellow. The plant features a single, erect stem with broad, pleated leaves, and its roots are adapted to thrive in cool, moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
