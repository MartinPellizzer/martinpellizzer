                    <h1>Canarium vrieseanum f. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Canarium vrieseanum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candlenut, is a variant of the candlenut tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree with lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing oily seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye.</p>
<p>The narrow leaf morphology distinguishes this form from the typical candlenut species.</p>
