                    <h1>Cyperus spicigerus</h1>
<p>Cyperus spicigerus, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense vegetation that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyperus spicigerus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
