                    <h1>Campanula persicifolia var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Campanula persicifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>The variety lasiocarpa is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
