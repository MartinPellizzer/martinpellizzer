                    <h1>Carex filispica</h1>
<p>Carex filispica, commonly known as the slender thread sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Carex filispica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
