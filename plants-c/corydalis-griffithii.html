                    <h1>Corydalis griffithii</h1>
<p>Corydalis griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces a unique type of seed pod that splits open to release its seeds, a feature common in the genus Corydalis. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
