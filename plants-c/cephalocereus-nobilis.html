<p>Cephalocereus nobilis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night, and it is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
