                    <h1>Crocodilodes welwitschii</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's crocodile plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble the scales of a crocodile, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
