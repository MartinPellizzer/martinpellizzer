                    <h1>Critoniopsis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as the quebracho and coca, through haustoria.</p>
<p>Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by berries that are consumed by various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
