                    <h1>Cynodon × magennisii</h1>
<p>Cynodon × magennisii, commonly known as the hybrid Bermuda grass, is a sterile, clump-forming grass that results from the cross between Cynodon dactylon and Cynodon pugnax.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant is typically found in warm climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It has a shallow root system and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense turf.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly used for forage or agricultural purposes due to its sterility and limited seed production.</p>
