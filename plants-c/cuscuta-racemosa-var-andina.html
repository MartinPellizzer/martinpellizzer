                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. andina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. andina, commonly known as Andean dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a slender, twining stem that attaches to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is native to South America and often found growing on agricultural crops and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its environment.</p>
