<p>Carex delicata subsp.</p>
<p>selengensis, commonly known as the Selengian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open, often alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
