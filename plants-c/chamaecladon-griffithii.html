                    <h1>Chamaecladon griffithii</h1>
<p>Chamaecladon griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
