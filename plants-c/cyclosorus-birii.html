                    <h1>Cyclosorus birii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus birii, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marchaliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemmiferous cells.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus birii is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
