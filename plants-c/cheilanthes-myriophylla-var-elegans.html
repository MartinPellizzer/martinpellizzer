                    <h1>Cheilanthes myriophylla var. elegans</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes myriophylla var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where it can access moisture from dew or rain. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
