<p>Calcitrapa lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Calcitrapa lutea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
