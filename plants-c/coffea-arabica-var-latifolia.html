                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf coffee, is a variant of the Arabica coffee species characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Ethiopia and is known for its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other Coffea species. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation and specific growing conditions, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee variety.</p>
