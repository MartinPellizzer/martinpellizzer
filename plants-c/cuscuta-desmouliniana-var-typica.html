                    <h1>Cuscuta desmouliniana var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta desmouliniana var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species, including crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
