                    <h1>Cuscuta australis var. bidentis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta australis var. bidentis, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants, forming a dense network. It is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental crops.</p>
