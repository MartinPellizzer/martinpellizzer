                    <h1>Chelidurus</h1>
<p>Chelidurus, commonly known as the sea urchin, is a marine echinoderm characterized by its spiny, spherical body.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Echinoidea and is found in various marine environments worldwide. The plant-like appearance of its body is due to its calcareous exoskeleton, which provides structural support. Chelidurus lacks true leaves or roots, instead relying on its spines for protection and mobility.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are internal, with females laying eggs that develop externally in the water.</p>
