The leaves are short and broad, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
