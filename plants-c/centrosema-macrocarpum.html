<p>Centrosema macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited centrosema, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Centrosema macrocarpum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
