                    <h1>Cudicia</h1>
<p>Cudicia, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cudicia is often used in herbal medicine for its mild diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
