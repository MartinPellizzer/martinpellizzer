                    <h1>Ceratolacis</h1>
<p>Ceratolacis, commonly known as the horned lac scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like projections on its body, which give it its common name. The plant it infests is typically a host in the genus Eucalyptus, where it feeds on sap. The insect's waxy secretions can cause leaf discoloration and reduce plant vigor.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant pest in certain regions of Australia and beyond.</p>
