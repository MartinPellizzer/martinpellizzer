<p>Cheilanthes microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.</p>
