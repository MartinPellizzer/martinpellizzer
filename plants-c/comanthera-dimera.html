                    <h1>Comanthera dimera</h1>
<p>Comanthera dimera, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique epiphytic growth habit, where it attaches to trees without being parasitic. The plant has a delicate, leafless stem and produces flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Comanthera dimera is considered an endangered species.</p>
