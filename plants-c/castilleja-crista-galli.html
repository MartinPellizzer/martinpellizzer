                    <h1>Castilleja crista-galli</h1>
<p>Castilleja crista-galli, commonly known as the goat's horn or golden crown, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red bracts that resemble a crown. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja crista-galli blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
