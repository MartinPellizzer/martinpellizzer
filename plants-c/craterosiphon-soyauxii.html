<p>Craterosiphon soyauxii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
