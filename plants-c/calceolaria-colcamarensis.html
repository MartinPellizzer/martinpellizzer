<p>Calceolaria colcamarensis, commonly known as the sea calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-shaped flowers, which resemble small cups or bells. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calceolaria colcamarensis is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystem.</p>
