<p>Chlorophytum polyscapum, commonly known as the spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that form a rosette pattern, often with a white or yellow stripe running down the center. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems, which eventually give way to bright green, football-shaped berries. It is a hardy and low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Chlorophytum polyscapum is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to purify the air and its ease of propagation through its offsets.</p>
