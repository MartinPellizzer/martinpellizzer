                    <h1>Capanemia superflua</h1>
<p>Capanemia superflua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are elongated and strap-shaped, often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
