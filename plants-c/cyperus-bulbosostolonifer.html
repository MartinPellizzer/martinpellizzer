<p>Cyperus bulbosostolonifer, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread through underground stems called stolons. The plant produces dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves and bears spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
