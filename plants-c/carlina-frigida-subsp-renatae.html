<p>Carlina frigida subsp.</p>
<p>renatae, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, high-altitude soils.</p>
