                    <h1>Calyptraria eximia</h1>
<p>Calyptraria eximia, commonly known as the elegant lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
