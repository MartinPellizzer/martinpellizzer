                    <h1>Cassytha pomiformis var. pubiflora</h1>
<p>Cassytha pomiformis var. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds. It relies on host plants for nutrients and often grows on trees or shrubs in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments where it can thrive as a hemiparasite.</p>
