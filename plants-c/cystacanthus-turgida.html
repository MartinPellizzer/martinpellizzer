                    <h1>Cystacanthus turgida</h1>
<p>Cystacanthus turgida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>These specialized organs are adapted for capturing small aquatic organisms, such as insects and crustaceans, through suction. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. Its morphology is highly modified, with reduced leaves and a focus on the bladder-like structures for predation.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous tendencies, Cystacanthus turgida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
