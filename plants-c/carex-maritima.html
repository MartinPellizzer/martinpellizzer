                    <h1>Carex maritima</h1>
<p>Carex maritima, commonly known as salt meadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces spike-like inflorescences containing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex maritima plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
