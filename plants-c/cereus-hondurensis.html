                    <h1>Cereus hondurensis</h1>
<p>Cereus hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran candleplant, is a cactus native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a trait common among many nocturnal flowering plants. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide some protection from herbivores.</p>
