<p>Chorispora tenella, commonly known as the coastal dwarf bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are used for capturing prey. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its flowering stems bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Chorispora tenella plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
