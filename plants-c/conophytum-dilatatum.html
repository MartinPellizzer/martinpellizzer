<p>Conophytum dilatatum, commonly known as the "Cape Flax" or "Cape Flaxflower," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Conophytum dilatatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
