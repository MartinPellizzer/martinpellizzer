                    <h1>Chirocalyx</h1>
<p>Chirocalyx, commonly known as the "hand calyx," is a unique botanical feature found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It refers to a type of calyx that is modified to resemble a hand, with distinct lobes that may be fused or separate. This structure typically encloses the flower buds and protects them before blooming. The chirocalyx is most commonly observed in species of the genus *Calyptera* and *Calyptrocalyx*.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology plays a role in the plant's reproductive strategy and ecological interactions.</p>
