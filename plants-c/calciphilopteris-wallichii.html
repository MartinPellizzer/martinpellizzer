                    <h1>Calciphilopteris wallichii</h1>
<p>Calciphilopteris wallichii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy fern species that thrives in calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. This plant is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny environments. Its ability to tolerate alkaline conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>The plantâ€™s unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
