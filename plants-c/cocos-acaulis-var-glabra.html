                    <h1>Cocos acaulis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Cocos acaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its smooth, unbranched stem.</p>
<p>It is a tropical plant that thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves and develops coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut. Its glabrous stem and compact growth habit make it distinct from other coconut varieties.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
