<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Cicer chorassanicum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
