<p>Chromolucuma stipulifera, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are fragrant and yellowish-white, producing small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
