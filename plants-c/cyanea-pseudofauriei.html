                    <h1>Cyanea pseudofauriei</h1>
<p>Cyanea pseudofauriei, commonly known as the HaleakalƒÅ ironwood, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in coastal or upland habitats. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyanea pseudofauriei is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
