                    <h1>Calytrix decussata</h1>
<p>Calytrix decussata, commonly known as the clustered coral tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth that provides habitat for native wildlife.</p>
