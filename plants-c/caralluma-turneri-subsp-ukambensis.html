<p>Caralluma turneri subsp.</p>
<p>ukambensis, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
