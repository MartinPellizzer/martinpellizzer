                    <h1>Calonemorchis harringtoniae</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis harringtoniae, commonly known as the Harrington's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
