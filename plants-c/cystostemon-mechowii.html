<p>Cystostemon mechowii, commonly known as the Mechoow's ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes vines and climbers, though it exhibits a more shrub-like growth habit. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cystostemon mechowii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
