                    <h1>Cactus pruinosus</h1>
<p>Cactus pruinosus, commonly known as the powdered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in a waxy, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
