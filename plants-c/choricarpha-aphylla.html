                    <h1>Choricarpha aphylla</h1>
<p>Choricarpha aphylla, commonly known as the nakedleaf choricarpha, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Choricarpha aphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
