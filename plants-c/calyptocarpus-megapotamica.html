                    <h1>Calyptocarpus megapotamica</h1>
<p>Calyptocarpus megapotamica, commonly known as the Andean mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Calyptocarpus megapotamica is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>
