<p>Convolvulus quinquelobus, commonly known as the five-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its climbing habit is supported by tendrils that allow it to ascend structures or other plants.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
