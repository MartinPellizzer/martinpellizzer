<p>Chortolirion subspicatum, commonly known as the desert star or desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, succulent-like appearance with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Chortolirion subspicatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
