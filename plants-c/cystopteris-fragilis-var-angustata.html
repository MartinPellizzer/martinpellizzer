                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. angustata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaf brittle fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its fragility, as the fronds can easily break apart, giving the plant its common name.</p>
