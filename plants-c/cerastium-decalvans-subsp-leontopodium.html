<p>Cerastium decalvans subsp.</p>
<p>leontopodium, commonly known as the snowberry sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
