                    <h1>Cyanococcus tenellus</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus tenellus, commonly known as the blue-green alga, is a type of cyanobacterium that thrives in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to perform photosynthesis, producing oxygen and organic compounds. This organism is often found in freshwater lakes and ponds, where it forms dense mats on the surface. Cyanococcus tenellus plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and serves as a primary producer in many aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its rapid growth can lead to harmful algal blooms under certain environmental conditions.</p>
