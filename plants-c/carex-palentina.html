                    <h1>Carex palentina</h1>
<p>Carex palentina, commonly known as slender sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex palentina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
