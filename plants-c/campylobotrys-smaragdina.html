                    <h1>Campylobotrys smaragdina</h1>
<p>Campylobotrys smaragdina, commonly known as the green flagellate algae, is a unicellular aquatic organism belonging to the genus Campylobotrys.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped cell body and the presence of two flagella that aid in locomotion. This species is typically found in freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. Its chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, allowing it to produce its own food.</p>
<p>Campylobotrys smaragdina plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the food web as a primary producer.</p>
