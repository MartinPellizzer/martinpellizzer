                    <h1>Cousinia laniceps</h1>
<p>Cousinia laniceps, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming low, cushion-like structures that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, providing insulation against extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Cousinia laniceps is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
