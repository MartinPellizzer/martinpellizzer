<p>Cecropia megastachya, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and elongated, light green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded tropical habitats.</p>
