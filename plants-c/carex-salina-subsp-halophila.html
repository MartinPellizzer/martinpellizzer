<p>Carex salina subsp.</p>
<p>halophila, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes where it tolerates high concentrations of salt in the soil and water.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
