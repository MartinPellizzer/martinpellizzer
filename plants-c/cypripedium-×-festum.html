                    <h1>Cypripedium × festum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × festum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a captivating orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which serves as a unique adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that emerge from a rhizome, supporting the plant's growth and survival.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Cypripedium × festum results from crosses between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium montanum, contributing to its genetic diversity and ornamental appeal.</p>
