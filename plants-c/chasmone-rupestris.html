                    <h1>Chasmone rupestris</h1>
<p>Chasmone rupestris, commonly known as the rock chasmone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
