                    <h1>Ceratozamia latifolia</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more robust than the male ones. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
