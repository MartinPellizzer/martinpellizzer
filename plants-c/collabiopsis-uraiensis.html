                    <h1>Collabiopsis uraiensis</h1>
<p>Collabiopsis uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraiensis lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Caliciaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is dark brown to black, with a granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes or cracks. It is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
