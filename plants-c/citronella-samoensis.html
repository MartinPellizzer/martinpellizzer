                    <h1>Citronella samoensis</h1>
<p>Citronella samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan citronella, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the islands of Samoa and nearby Pacific regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties, which are attributed to the presence of volatile oils.</p>
<p>Citronella samoensis is also valued for its potential insect-repelling qualities, similar to other citronella species.</p>
