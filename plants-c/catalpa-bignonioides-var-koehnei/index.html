                            <h1>Catalpa Bignonioides Var. Koehnei</h1>
<p>Koehne's catalpa, scientifically known as Catalpa bignonioides var. koehnei, is a unique and lesser-known variant of the catalpa tree native to the southeastern United States. This deciduous tree is prized for its striking heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and landscapes. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to other catalpa species. Its historical and ecological significance makes it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
