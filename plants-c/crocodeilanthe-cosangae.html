                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe cosangae</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe cosangae, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a rare and unique tropical fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble the shape of a crocodile's tongue. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are deeply divided and often have a waxy texture, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
