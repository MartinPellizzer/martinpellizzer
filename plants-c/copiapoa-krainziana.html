                    <h1>Copiapoa krainziana</h1>
<p>Copiapoa krainziana, commonly known as the Krainz's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to overwatering, it requires well-draining soil and minimal care to thrive.</p>
