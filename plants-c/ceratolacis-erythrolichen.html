                    <h1>Ceratolacis erythrolichen</h1>
<p>Ceratolacis erythrolichen, commonly known as the red lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red to orange thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, granular structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component, usually from the genus Xanthoria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark, soil, or rocks.</p>
<p>Its vibrant coloration makes it easily identifiable and a common sight in forested areas.</p>
