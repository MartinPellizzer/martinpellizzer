<p>Cereus reductus, commonly known as the reduced cereus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, nocturnal blooms that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
