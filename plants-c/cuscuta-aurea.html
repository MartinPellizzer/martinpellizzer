                    <h1>Cuscuta aurea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta aurea, commonly known as golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is often found on various agricultural crops and wild plants, causing significant damage to its host. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta aurea is an example of a holoparasitic species that plays a role in ecological interactions and can be a challenge in agricultural settings.</p>
