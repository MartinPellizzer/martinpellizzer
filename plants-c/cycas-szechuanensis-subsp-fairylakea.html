<p>Cycas szechuanensis subsp.</p>
<p>fairylakea, commonly known as the Fairy Lake cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
