<p>Convallaria majalis subf.</p>
<p>picta, commonly known as the spotted lily or painted lily, is a striking variant of the traditional lily species. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted or mottled leaves, which give it a unique visual appearance.</p>
<p>This subform is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland environments. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers with a sweet fragrance, typically blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive.</p>
