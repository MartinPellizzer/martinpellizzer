                            <h1>Cerastium Diffusum Var. Sennenii</h1>
<p>Cerastium diffusum var. sennenii is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to central and southern Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or gravelly habitats. This variant is known for its compact growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient choice for gardens. Its leaves are hairy and often appear in pairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and enhancing biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
