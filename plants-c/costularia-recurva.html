<p>Costularia recurva, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance and stinging hairs.</p>
<p>Costularia recurva is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges.</p>
