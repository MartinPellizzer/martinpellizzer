                    <h1>Caltha leptosepala var. biflora</h1>
<p>Caltha leptosepala var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodlands. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating, while the stems are slender and often hairy.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'biflora' refers to its tendency to produce two flowers per stem, a feature that distinguishes it from other varieties of Caltha.</p>
