                    <h1>Cacabus prostratus</h1>
<p>Cacabus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows primarily on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
