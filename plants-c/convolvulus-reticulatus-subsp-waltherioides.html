<p>Convolvulus reticulatus subsp.</p>
<p>waltherioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a trailing or climbing annual herb with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful pioneer species and a potential weed.</p>
