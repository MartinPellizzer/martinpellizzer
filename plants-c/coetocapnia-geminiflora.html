                    <h1>Coetocapnia geminiflora</h1>
<p>Coetocapnia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with two distinct flowers emerging from a single stem. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture limited sunlight in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coetocapnia geminiflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
