<p>Cenchrus pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Pilcomayo grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
