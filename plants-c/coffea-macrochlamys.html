<p>Coffea macrochlamys, commonly known as the large-chambered coffee.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing two seeds. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
