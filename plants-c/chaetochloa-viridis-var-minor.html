<p>Chaetochloa viridis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf green hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features fine, dark green blades with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants.</p>
<p>Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
