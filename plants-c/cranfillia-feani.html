                    <h1>Cranfillia feani</h1>
<p>Cranfillia feani, commonly known as the Fena's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cranfillia feani is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
