<p>Cassia artemisioides var. phyllodinea, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified phyllodes, which are flattened stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
