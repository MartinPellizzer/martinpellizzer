                    <h1>Chryza borealis</h1>
<p>Chryza borealis, commonly known as the northern chryza, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to climate change, Chryza borealis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
