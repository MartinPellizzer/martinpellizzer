                    <h1>Campyloneurum longifolium</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, acidic soils, making it a common sight in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Campyloneurum longifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
