                    <h1>Cyperus cartilagineus var. serratangulus</h1>
<p>Cyperus cartilagineus var. serratangulus, commonly known as the serrated papyrus sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flower spikes during the wet season. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this species make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
