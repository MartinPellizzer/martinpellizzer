                    <h1>Corymbia collina</h1>
<p>Corymbia collina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed apple or the grey gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a medium to tall tree that typically grows up to 25 meters in height, featuring smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Its flowers are small and white or pink, arranged in clusters, and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The tree produces woody fruits that contain edible seeds, making it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
