<p>Cladogynos orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cladogynos, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cladogynos orientalis is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological and medicinal value.</p>
