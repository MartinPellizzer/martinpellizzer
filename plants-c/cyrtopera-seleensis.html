                <h1>Cyrtopera seleensis</h1>
<p>Cyrtopera seleensis, commonly known as the Sele Islands spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, particularly the islands of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Cyrtopera seleensis is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, showing resilience to salt spray and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local fauna, though it is not widely cultivated.</p>
