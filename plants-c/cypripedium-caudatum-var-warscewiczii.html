<p>Cypripedium caudatum var. warscewiczii, commonly known as the Warshawicz's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant features a single, erect stem with broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
