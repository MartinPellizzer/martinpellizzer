<p>Chamaesyce nummularia var. glabra, commonly known as silverleaf purslane, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
