The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
