<p>Calycobolus upembaensis, commonly known as the Upemba bulbous plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, thickened leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal spike, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Calycobolus upembaensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering habit.</p>
