                    <h1>Cynanchum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum pygmaeum, commonly known as small milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, like that of other milkweeds, contains latex and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cynanchum pygmaeum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
