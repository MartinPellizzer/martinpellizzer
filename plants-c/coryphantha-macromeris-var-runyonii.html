                    <h1>Coryphantha macromeris var. runyonii</h1>
<p>Coryphantha macromeris var. runyonii, commonly known as Runyon's large-fruited cactus, is a variety of the large-fruit cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of areoles with clusters of spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
