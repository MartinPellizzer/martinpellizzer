                    <h1>Carex platysperma</h1>
<p>Carex platysperma, commonly known as broad-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The fruiting structures, called achenes, are enclosed in a three-lobed bract, which is a distinctive feature of this species.</p>
