                    <h1>Cryptophragmium hirsutum</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy cryptophragmium, is a unique member of the Lecanoraceae family within the lichenized fungi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy growth on the thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga, contributing to its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its structure and composition make it an interesting subject for studies on lichen biology and ecological adaptation.</p>
