                    <h1>Cordia opaca</h1>
<p>Cordia opaca, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species for shoreline vegetation.</p>
