<p>Ceropegia parvioriflora subsp.</p>
<p>dependens, commonly known as the hanging ceropegia, is a climbing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tendrils that allow it to climb and attach to supports, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or trained structures.</p>
<p>The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
