<p>Cyperus sanguinolentus var. micronux, commonly known as the red swamp cyperus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and reddish-brown inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing seeds that are dispersed by water, contributing to its ecological impact.</p>
