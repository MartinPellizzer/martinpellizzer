                    <h1>Cistus oelandicus var. denudatus</h1>
<p>Cistus oelandicus var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked rock rose, is a shrub native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other Cistus species.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
