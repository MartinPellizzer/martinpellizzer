                    <h1>Cuscuta hispidula</h1>
<p>Cuscuta hispidula, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants and then developing specialized structures to attach to them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems that coil around its host, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. It is often found in agricultural fields and natural habitats where it can infest a variety of host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
