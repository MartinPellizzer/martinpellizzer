<p>Cycnoches cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's cycnoches, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of certain insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches cooperi is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
