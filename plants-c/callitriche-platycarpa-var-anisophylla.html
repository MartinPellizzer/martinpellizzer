<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. anisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterstar, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical variety. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in dense clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
