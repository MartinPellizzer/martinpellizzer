                    <h1>Cynanchum atratum f. multinerve</h1>
<p>Cynanchum atratum f. multinerve, commonly known as the multivened black swallowwort, is a variant of the black swallowwort species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making it a potential weed in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated but requires careful management to prevent invasiveness.</p>
