                    <h1>Colletia infausta</h1>
<p>Colletia infausta, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its branching, columnar stems that often form a bush-like structure. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Colletia infausta is adapted to extreme drought conditions and can survive with minimal rainfall.</p>
