<p>Cassytha filiformis var. pergracilis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to absorb nutrients. The plant has thin, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>It is often found on a variety of woody plants, including trees and shrubs, in shaded, moist environments.</p>
