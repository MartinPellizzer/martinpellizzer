The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, hardy seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>
