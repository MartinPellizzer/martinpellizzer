                    <h1>Cactus tuberculosus</h1>
<p>Cactus tuberculosus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly after rainfall.</p>
<p>Cactus tuberculosus is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in containers with minimal watering.</p>
