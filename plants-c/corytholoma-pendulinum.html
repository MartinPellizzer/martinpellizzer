                    <h1>Corytholoma pendulinum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming a dense, velvety thallus with a yellowish to brownish hue. The plant's unique morphology includes a central cup-like structure surrounded by a fringe of lobes, which helps in capturing moisture and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized symbiotic relationship with algae make it an important indicator species for forest health.</p>
