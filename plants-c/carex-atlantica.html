                    <h1>Carex atlantica</h1>
<p>Carex atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex atlantica plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
