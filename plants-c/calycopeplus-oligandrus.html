                    <h1>Calycopeplus oligandrus</h1>
<p>Calycopeplus oligandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Calycopeplus oligandrus thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
