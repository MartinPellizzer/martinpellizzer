<p>Crataegus silvicola var. beckwithiae, commonly known as the Beckwith's hawthorn, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
