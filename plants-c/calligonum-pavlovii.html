<p>Calligonum pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, multi-branched structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in summer, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline and alkaline soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum pavlovii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
