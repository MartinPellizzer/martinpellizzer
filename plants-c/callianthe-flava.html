                    <h1>Callianthe flava</h1>
<p>Callianthe flava, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Callianthe flava is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or dry soils.</p>
