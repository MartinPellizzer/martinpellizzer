<p>Chaenactis douglasii var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Mouse-eared Cactus, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a mat-forming perennial with woolly, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the soil in rocky, alpine habitats.</p>
<p>It is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
