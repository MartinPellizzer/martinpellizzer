                            <h1>Cerastium Glandulosum</h1>
<p>Mouse-ear chickweed, scientifically known as Cerastium glandulosum, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, giving it its common name. This hardy species thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its delicate white flowers appear in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to the landscape. Despite its modest appearance, Mouse-ear chickweed plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability.</p>
