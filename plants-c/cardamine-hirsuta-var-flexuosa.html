<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. flexuosa, commonly known as the hairy buttercup or flexible water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to wet environments.</p>
