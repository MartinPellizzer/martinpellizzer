<p>Cakile lanceolata subsp.</p>
<p>alacranensis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly cress, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its subspecies name, *alacranensis*, refers to its association with areas where scorpions (alacr√°n) are common.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
