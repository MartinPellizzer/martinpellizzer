                    <h1>Cenchrus carolinianus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolinian grass or panicum carolinianum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often visible during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Cenchrus carolinianus is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
