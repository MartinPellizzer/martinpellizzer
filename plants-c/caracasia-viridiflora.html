                    <h1>Caracasia viridiflora</h1>
<p>Caracasia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered caracasia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant green petals that contrast beautifully with its silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Caracasia viridiflora is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its adaptive traits.</p>
