                    <h1>Cheilanthes pruinosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and grayish-white, waxy coating on its fronds, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on cliffs or in crevices, where it can access limited moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
