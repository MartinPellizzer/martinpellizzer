                    <h1>Cremanthodium pinnatisectum</h1>
<p>Cremanthodium pinnatisectum, commonly known as the dissected globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a globular inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, pinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
