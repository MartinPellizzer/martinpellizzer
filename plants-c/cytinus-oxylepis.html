                    <h1>Cytinus oxylepis</h1>
<p>Cytinus oxylepis, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil.</p>
<p>Cytinus oxylepis is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
