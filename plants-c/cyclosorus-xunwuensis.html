                    <h1>Cyclosorus xunwuensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus xunwuensis, commonly known as the Xunwu water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
