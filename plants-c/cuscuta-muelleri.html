                    <h1>Cuscuta muelleri</h1>
<p>Cuscuta muelleri, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to a host through specialized haustoria. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it can infest a variety of host plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a challenging weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta muelleri plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics.</p>
