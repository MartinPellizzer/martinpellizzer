                    <h1>Carex ptychocarpa var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Carex ptychocarpa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf basket sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its larger, broader leaves compared to other Carex species.</p>
