                    <h1>Chondrorhyncha fosterae</h1>
<p>Chondrorhyncha fosterae, commonly known as the Foster's coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its mycorrhizal associations for nutrition. Its small, white, coral-like flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
