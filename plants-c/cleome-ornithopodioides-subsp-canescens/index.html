                            <h1>Cleome Ornithopodioides Subsp. Canescens</h1>
<p>Cleome ornithopodioides subsp. canescens is a lesser-known member of the Cleomaceae family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant has adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its hairy, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers make it a striking addition to any landscape. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated in horticultural circles. Understanding its biology and habitat can aid in its conservation and potential use in sustainable landscaping.</p>
