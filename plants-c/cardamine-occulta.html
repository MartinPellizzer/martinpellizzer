                    <h1>Cardamine occulta</h1>
<p>Cardamine occulta, commonly known as the hidden watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist woodlands and stream banks in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, upright stems that bear alternate, trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on consistent moisture for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Cardamine occulta is often found in shaded, cool environments and is valued for its delicate appearance and ecological significance.</p>
