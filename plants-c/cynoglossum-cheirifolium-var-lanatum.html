                    <h1>Cynoglossum cheirifolium var. lanatum</h1>
<p>Cynoglossum cheirifolium var. lanatum, commonly known as the Woolly Bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it its varietal name "lanatum," derived from the Latin word for wool. The plant produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance.</p>
