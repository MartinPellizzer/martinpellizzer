                    <h1>Critesion chilense</h1>
<p>Critesion chilense, commonly known as the Chilean cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to the arid climate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its foliage is reduced to spines, which help to minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
