                    <h1>Cuscuta scabrella</h1>
<p>Cuscuta scabrella, commonly known as the rough dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant's stems are hairy and often curl around the stems of its host, forming a dense network. It is found in various habitats, including grasslands and agricultural fields, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays an important role in ecological interactions and can be a challenge for agricultural management.</p>
