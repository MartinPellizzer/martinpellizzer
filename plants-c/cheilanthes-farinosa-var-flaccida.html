                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
