                    <h1>Cycas thouarsii</h1>
<p>Cycas thouarsii, commonly known as the Tahitian cycad, is a cycad species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical, often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Cycas thouarsii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 200 million years.</p>
