<p>Conophyllum brevisepalum, commonly known as the short-scaled conophyllum, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Conophyllum brevisepalum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature in harsh environments.</p>
