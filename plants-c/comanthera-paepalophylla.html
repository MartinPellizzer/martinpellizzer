                    <h1>Comanthera paepalophylla</h1>
<p>Comanthera paepalophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family, native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique, tubular, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Comanthera paepalophylla is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of moths and bees.</p>
