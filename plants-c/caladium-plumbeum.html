<p>Caladium plumbeum, commonly known as the Variegated Cabbage Plant, is a tropical perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, cream, and green patterns. The plant thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Caladium plumbeum is typically grown for its striking leaf coloration rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous.</p>
