<p>Ceratostylis formicifera var. formicifera, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic herb that grows on tree trunks and branches in tropical rainforests. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection in exchange for shelter and food. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features include fleshy, ridged leaves and a specialized structure called a "tubular sheath" that houses the ant colony.</p>
