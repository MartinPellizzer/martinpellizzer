                    <h1>Calandrinia acuta</h1>
<p>Calandrinia acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rainfall.</p>
<p>Calandrinia acuta is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates.</p>
