The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
