<p>Cephalotaxus harringtonia f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright yew or compact yew, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub with a distinctive pyramidal shape.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery foliage that remains dense and uniform throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental but not edible for humans. It is native to China and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for use as a hedge or specimen plant.</p>
