<p>Cacalia obconica, commonly known as the narrowleaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
