                    <h1>Campanula nutabunda</h1>
<p>Campanula nutabunda, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Campanula nutabunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
