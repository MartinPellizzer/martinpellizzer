                    <h1>Calamagrostis variflora</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis variflora, commonly known as variable reedgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis variflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
