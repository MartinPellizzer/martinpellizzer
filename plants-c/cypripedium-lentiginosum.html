<p>Cypripedium lentiginosum, commonly known as the spotted moccasin orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue and intricate patterns of brown and purple. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, upright flower stem that bears a single bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
