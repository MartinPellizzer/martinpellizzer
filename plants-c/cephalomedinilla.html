                    <h1>Cephalomedinilla</h1>
<p>Cephalomedinilla, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a rare and unique plant found primarily in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble sea foam, and its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to withstand salty air. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
