                    <h1>Cornopteris parvisora</h1>
<p>Cornopteris parvisora, commonly known as the small-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinct, narrow shape and a pale, sometimes rusty-colored margin.</p>
<p>Cornopteris parvisora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
