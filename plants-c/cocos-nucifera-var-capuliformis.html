                    <h1>Cocos nucifera var. capuliformis</h1>
<p>Cocos nucifera var. capuliformis, commonly known as the bottle tree coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique, swollen trunk that resembles a bottle.</p>
<p>This morphological feature is due to the accumulation of water and nutrients in the stem, which helps the plant survive in arid or coastal environments. The plant produces large, hairy fruits that contain a single, large seed, typical of the coconut family. It is often found in tropical regions where it thrives in sandy soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
