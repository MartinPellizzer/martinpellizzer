<p>Corylus avellana var. compressa, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, cup-shaped husks that enclose its edible nuts, which are rich in nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>The variety 'compressa' is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded nuts compared to other hazelnut species.</p>
