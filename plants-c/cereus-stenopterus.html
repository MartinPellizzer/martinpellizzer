                    <h1>Cereus stenopterus</h1>
<p>Cereus stenopterus, commonly known as the night bloomer or night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a spiny, columnar plant that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. Its most distinctive feature is its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and last for only one night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
