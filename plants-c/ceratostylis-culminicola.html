                    <h1>Ceratostylis culminicola</h1>
<p>Ceratostylis culminicola, commonly known as the highland marsh orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as mountainous marshes and peat bogs. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic and nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
