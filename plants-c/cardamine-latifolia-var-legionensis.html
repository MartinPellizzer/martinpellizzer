                    <h1>Cardamine latifolia var. legionensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine latifolia var. legionensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, often calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosettes of broadly ovate, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wet environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable.</p>
