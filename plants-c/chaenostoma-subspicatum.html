                    <h1>Chaenostoma subspicatum</h1>
<p>Chaenostoma subspicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, and has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which help in attracting pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can play a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in water ecosystems and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
