                    <h1>Centaurium linariifolium subsp. gypsicola</h1>
<p>Centaurium linariifolium subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, particularly on gypsum outcrops, which influence its unique morphology and chemical composition. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
