                    <h1>Crassocephalum densifolium</h1>
<p>Crassocephalum densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into spherical, spiny seed heads, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
