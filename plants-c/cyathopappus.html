                    <h1>Cyathopappus</h1>
<p>Cyathopappus, commonly known as the "desert sunflower," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Cyathopappus species are characterized by their small, yellow to orange flowers and distinctive, bract-like structures that protect the developing seeds. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
