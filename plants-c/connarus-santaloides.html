                    <h1>Connarus santaloides</h1>
<p>Connarus santaloides, commonly known as the Brazilian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, woody heartwood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite, and ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Connarus santaloides is considered endangered in its native habitats.</p>
