<p>Calamintha alpina var. adrianopolitana, commonly known as the Adrianopolitan mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters.
