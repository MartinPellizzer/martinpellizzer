                    <h1>Cecropia candida</h1>
<p>Cecropia candida, commonly known as the white cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and long, slender stipes that support its compound inflorescences. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense panicles, which are often visited by various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by ants, a mutualistic relationship known as myrmecochory.</p>
<p>Cecropia candida is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession.</p>
