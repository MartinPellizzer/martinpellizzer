<p>Castilleja villicaulis, commonly known as the slenderleaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats like meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Castilleja villicaulis plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and contributing to plant community diversity.</p>
