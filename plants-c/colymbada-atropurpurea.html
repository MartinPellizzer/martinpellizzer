<p>Colymbada atropurpurea, commonly known as purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark purple to reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and damp meadows.</p>
<p>Colymbada atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important species for biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
