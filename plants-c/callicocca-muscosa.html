<p>Callicocca muscosa, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
