                    <h1>Cenchrus elymoides var. brevisetosus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus elymoides var. brevisetosus, commonly known as slender sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dunes, plains, and disturbed areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
