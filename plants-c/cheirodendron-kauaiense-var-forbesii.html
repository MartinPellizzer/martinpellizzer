<p>Cheirodendron kauaiense var. forbesii, commonly known as Kauai hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, often near streams or in valleys. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
