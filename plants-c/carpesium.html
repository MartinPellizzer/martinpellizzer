                    <h1>Carpesium</h1>
<p>Carpesium, commonly known as the beggar's ticks, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like structures that often resemble small, hooked bristles. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Carpesium species typically have small, yellow or white flowers arranged in composite heads, and they produce achene fruits enclosed in persistent, pappus-bearing bracts.</p>
<p>The genus includes both annual and perennial species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
