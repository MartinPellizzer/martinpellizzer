                    <h1>Cecropia tubulosa</h1>
<p>Cecropia tubulosa, commonly known as the red cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in secondary forests, due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of pioneer vegetation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>The tree also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity, providing food and shelter for various insects and birds.</p>
