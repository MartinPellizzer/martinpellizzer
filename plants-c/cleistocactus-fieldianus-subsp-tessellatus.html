<p>Cleistocactus fieldianus subsp.</p>
<p>tessellatus, commonly known as the tessellated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a unique pattern of light and dark green tubercles that form a tessellated appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically hidden within the stems, a trait typical of the Cleistocactus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
