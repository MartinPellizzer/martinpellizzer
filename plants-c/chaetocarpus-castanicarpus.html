                    <h1>Chaetocarpus castanicarpus</h1>
<p>Chaetocarpus castanicarpus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It has a thick, woody stem with a distinctive red coloration due to the presence of tannins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruits are buoyant, aiding in seed dispersal by water. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
