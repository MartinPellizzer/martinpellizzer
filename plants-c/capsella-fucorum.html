<p>Capsella fucorum, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing numerous seeds.

<p>Capsella fucorum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
