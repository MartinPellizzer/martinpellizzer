                    <h1>Comandra umbellata var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Comandra umbellata var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent comandra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its stems are prostrate or decumbent, meaning they lie flat on the ground before rising, which helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and occur in dense, umbrella-like clusters, making it a distinctive and ornamental species.</p>
