                    <h1>Chaetospora distachya</h1>
<p>Chaetospora distachya, commonly known as the slender spore moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of leafy shoots that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, stalked spore capsules that are clustered in pairs, a feature that gives it its specific epithet "distachya.". It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species for studying liverwort ecology and evolution.</p>
