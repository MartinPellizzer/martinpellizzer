<p>Cotoneaster coriaceus, commonly known as the rough cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster coriaceus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
