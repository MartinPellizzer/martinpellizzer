                    <h1>Cheiropterocephalus</h1>
<p>Cheiropterocephalus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, ghost-like appearance. The plant relies on specific host trees for support and derives its nutrients from the air and rainwater. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pale green to white and have a distinctive, intricate structure.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
