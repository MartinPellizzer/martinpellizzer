                            <h1>Carex Teretiuscula Subsp. Modesta</h1>
<p>Carex teretiuscula subsp. modesta is a lesser-known sedge species that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its subtle appearance, it plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Its presence indicates healthy, undisturbed habitats and makes it a valuable indicator plant for ecological studies.</p>
