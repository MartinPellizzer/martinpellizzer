<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris microcarpa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with four petals, which are followed by triangular, heart-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
