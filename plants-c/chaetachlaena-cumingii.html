                    <h1>Chaetachlaena cumingii</h1>
<p>Chaetachlaena cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a delicate grass. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
