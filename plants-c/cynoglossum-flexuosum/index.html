                            <h1>Cynoglossum Flexuosum</h1>
<p>Cynoglossum flexuosum is a striking member of the Boraginaceae family known for its vibrant blue or violet flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its common names, including "hound's tongue" and "blueweed," reflect both its appearance and historical uses. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, bell-like flower structure that attracts pollinators. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
