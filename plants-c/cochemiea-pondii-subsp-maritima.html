<p>Cochemiea pondii subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal cochemiea, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from the harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid and coastal climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
