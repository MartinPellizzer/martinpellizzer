<p>Carludovica macropoda, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its large, showy flowers and distinctive foliage. The plant produces dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
