<p>Cochlidium tepuiense, commonly known as the tepui snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Helicarionidae and is characterized by its small, glossy shell with a distinct spiral pattern. The snail thrives in the humid, tropical environments of these isolated mountain ranges. Its diet primarily consists of leaf litter and decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Cochlidium tepuiense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
