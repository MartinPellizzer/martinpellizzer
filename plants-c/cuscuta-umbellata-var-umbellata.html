                    <h1>Cuscuta umbellata var. umbellata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta umbellata var. umbellata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to establish parasitic connections. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on plants such as milkweeds and other angiosperms.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
