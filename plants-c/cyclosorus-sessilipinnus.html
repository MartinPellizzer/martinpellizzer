<p>Cyclosorus sessilipinnus, commonly known as the sessile-pinnate water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branching fronds that are often submerged. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with short, sessile pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus sessilipinnus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
