                    <h1>Coronilla coronata</h1>
<p>Coronilla coronata, commonly known as the crowned vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, narrow pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Coronilla coronata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural settings.</p>
