                    <h1>Cicuta virosa f. longiinvolucellata</h1>
<p>Cicuta virosa f. longiinvolucellata, commonly known as the long-involucelated water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and woodland areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed margins, and it is known for its highly toxic sap containing cicutoxin.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans, making it a plant of caution rather than cultivation.</p>
