                    <h1>Calophyllum pulgarense</h1>
<p>Calophyllum pulgarense, commonly known as the Puerto Rican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Calophyllum pulgarense is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and construction, though it is now protected due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
