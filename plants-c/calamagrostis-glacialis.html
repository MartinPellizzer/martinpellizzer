                    <h1>Calamagrostis glacialis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis glacialis, commonly known as the alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and tundra, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
