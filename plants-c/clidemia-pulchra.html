                    <h1>Clidemia pulchra</h1>
<p>Clidemia pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
