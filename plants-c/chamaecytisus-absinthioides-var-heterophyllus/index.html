                            <h1>Chamaecytisus Absinthioides Var. Heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Scotch broom, scientifically known as Chamaecytisus absinthioides var. heterophyllus, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It is prized for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates has made it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping. However, its ecological impact has sparked debate among environmentalists and horticulturists alike.</p>
