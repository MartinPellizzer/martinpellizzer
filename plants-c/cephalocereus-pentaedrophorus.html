                    <h1>Cephalocereus pentaedrophorus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus pentaedrophorus, commonly known as the five-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, segmented structure, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems.</p>
