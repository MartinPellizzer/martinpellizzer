                    <h1>Corchorus antichorus</h1>
<p>Corchorus antichorus, commonly known as the white burr plant, is a species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into spiny, three-lobed seed pods. Its fibrous roots and stems have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
