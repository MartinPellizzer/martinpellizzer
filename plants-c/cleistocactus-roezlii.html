                    <h1>Cleistocactus roezlii</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus roezlii, commonly known as the RÃ¶tzli's close-cushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal cacti. Its unique morphology and habitat make it well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
