<p>Clematis hirsuta var. dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stemmed hirsute clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, contributing to its hirsute appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for trellises and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
