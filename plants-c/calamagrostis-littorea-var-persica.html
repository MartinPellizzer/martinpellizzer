                    <h1>Calamagrostis littorea var. persica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis littorea var. persica, commonly known as the Persian coastal reed, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. This variety thrives in saline and wet environments, making it well-suited for coastal or marshy habitats. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
