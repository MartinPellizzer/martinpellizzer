                    <h1>Cyclacanthus</h1>
<p>Cyclacanthus, commonly known as the star-shaped nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and peppers.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Cyclacanthus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
