                    <h1>Cytinus hypocistis var. striatus</h1>
<p>Cytinus hypocistis var. striatus, commonly known as the striped crown flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, red or orange-colored stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in the spring. Its leaves are scale-like and are often obscured by the swollen stem.</p>
<p>The varietal name "striatus" refers to the striped pattern on its stem, which adds to its visual appeal.</p>
