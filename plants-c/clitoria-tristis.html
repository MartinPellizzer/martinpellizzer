                    <h1>Clitoria tristis</h1>
<p>Clitoria tristis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or sorrowful plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces vibrant purple or violet pea-like flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming properties. Its roots contain compounds that have been studied for potential pharmacological applications.</p>
<p>Clitoria tristis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or cultivated in gardens.</p>
