<p>Cleistocactus hystrix, commonly known as the spiny hystrix cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is covered in sharp, spine-like structures, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus hystrix is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
