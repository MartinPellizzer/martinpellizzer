                    <h1>Cymbidium aphyllum</h1>
<p>Cymbidium aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with its photosynthetic function carried out by its fleshy, modified stems. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
