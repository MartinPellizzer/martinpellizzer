                    <h1>Colutea jamnolenkoi</h1>
<p>Colutea jamnolenkoi, commonly known as the Armenian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
