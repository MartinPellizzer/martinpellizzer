                    <h1>Cuscuta nevadensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta nevadensis, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to the western United States and thrives in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through attachment to the fur or feathers of animals.</p>
<p>Cuscuta nevadensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a parasite and a potential indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
