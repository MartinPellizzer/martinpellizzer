                    <h1>Carex stricta f. pedicellaris</h1>
<p>Carex stricta f. pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive inflorescence, which features elongated pedicels that distinguish it from other Carex species.</p>
