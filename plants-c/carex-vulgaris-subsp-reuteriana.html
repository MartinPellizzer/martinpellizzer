<p>Carex vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>reuteriana, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three ranks, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
<p>The subspecies reuteriana is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering structure compared to the typical form of Carex vulgaris.</p>
