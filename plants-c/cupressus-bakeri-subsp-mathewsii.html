<p>Cupressus bakeri subsp.</p>
<p>mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' cedar, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at high elevations. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
