<p>Cnemidaria abitaguensis, commonly known as the Abitagua grasshopper plant, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it is adapted to thrive in dry or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
