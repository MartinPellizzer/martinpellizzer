<p>Chitonia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed chiton, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Chitonidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated shell that is typically covered with a layer of calcareous plates. The shell is often adorned with a series of rows of small, overlapping scales, which provide protection against predators. This marine gastropod is typically found in intertidal zones, where it adheres to rocky surfaces using its muscular foot.</p>
<p>Its diet consists mainly of algae and other microscopic organisms, which it scrapes off the substrate using a radula.</p>
