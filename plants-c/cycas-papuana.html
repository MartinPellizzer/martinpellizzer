                    <h1>Cycas papuana</h1>
<p>Cycas papuana, commonly known as the Papuan cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Papua and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the trunk. Cycas papuana is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
