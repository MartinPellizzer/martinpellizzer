                    <h1>Chaetotropis</h1>
<p>Chaetotropis, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences known as cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Chaetotropis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
