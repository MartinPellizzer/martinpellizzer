<p>Ctenopteris knightii, commonly known as the Knight's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris knightii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in artificial ponds.</p>
