<p>Cyathea capitata, commonly known as the crowned tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of short, clustered fronds at the top of its trunk, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
