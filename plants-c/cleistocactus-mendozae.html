<p>Cleistocactus mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's close-cactus, is a rare cactus species native to the Andes mountains of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open only at night, a feature known as nyctinasty. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
