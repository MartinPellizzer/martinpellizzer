                    <h1>Cactus nivosus</h1>
<p>Cactus nivosus, commonly known as the snow cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Overall, Cactus nivosus exemplifies the adaptations of succulents to extreme climates.</p>
