                            <h1>Cotula Squalida</h1>
<p>Cotula squalida is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is known for its delicate yellow flowers and low-growing habit. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its common name, "squalid cotula," refers to its tendency to grow in harsh, neglected environments. Despite its modest appearance, Cotula squalida plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
