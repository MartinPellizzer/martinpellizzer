<p>Cereus acidus, commonly known as the acidic cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many desert plants. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cereus acidus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
