                    <h1>Caragana ordosica</h1>
<p>Caragana ordosica, commonly known as the Ordos shrub or sandbar shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Caragana ordosica plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
