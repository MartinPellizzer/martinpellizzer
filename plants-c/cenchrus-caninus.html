                    <h1>Cenchrus caninus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus caninus, commonly known as the sand ratgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale-colored florets. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation.</p>
<p>Cenchrus caninus is often used in erosion control due to its rapid establishment and hardy nature.</p>
