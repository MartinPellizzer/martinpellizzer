<p>Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. tortifolius, commonly known as the sticky flower goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and small animals.</p>
