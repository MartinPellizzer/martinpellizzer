                    <h1>Cheilanthes commutata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes commutata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
