                    <h1>Cyathea villosa var. rigidula</h1>
<p>Cyathea villosa var. rigidula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy sheath that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
