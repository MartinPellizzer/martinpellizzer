                    <h1>Cuscuta lupuliformis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lupuliformis, commonly known as the hop vine, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on shrubs and trees in moist, temperate regions. The plant's stems are wiry and can缠绕 around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread efficiently across different habitats.</p>
