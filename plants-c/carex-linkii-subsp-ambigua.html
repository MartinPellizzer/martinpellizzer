<p>Carex linkii subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats.</p>
