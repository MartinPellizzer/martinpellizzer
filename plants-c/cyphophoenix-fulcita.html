<p>Cyphophoenix fulcita, commonly known as the fulcrum date palm, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is not as widely cultivated as other date palm species. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of desert flora and plant adaptation.</p>
