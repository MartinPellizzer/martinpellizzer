                    <h1>Coronocarpus gayanus</h1>
<p>Coronocarpus gayanus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Coronocarpus gayanus is well adapted to drought and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
