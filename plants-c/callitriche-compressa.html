<p>Callitriche compressa, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are rounded and slightly fleshy. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche compressa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth.</p>
