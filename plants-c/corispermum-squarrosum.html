<p>Corispermum squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrose corisperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, hard, seed-containing pods. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Corispermum squarrosum plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations.</p>
