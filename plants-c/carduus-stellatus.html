<p>Carduus stellatus, commonly known as the star thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and a purple or pinkish flower head that resembles a star, hence its common name.

Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with flowering occurring in the summer months.</p>
<p>Carduus stellatus is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
