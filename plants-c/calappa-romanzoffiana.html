<p>Calappa romanzoffiana, commonly known as the Zanzibar cat's claw, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
