<p>Coelogyne vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
