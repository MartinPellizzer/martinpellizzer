<p>Cheilanthes cooperae, commonly known as the Cooper's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often found in regions with limestone or granite substrates.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes cooperae is well adapted to harsh climates and is a common sight in rocky habitats across its native range.</p>
