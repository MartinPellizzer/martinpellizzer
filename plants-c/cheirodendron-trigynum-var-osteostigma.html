                    <h1>Cheirodendron trigynum var. osteostigma</h1>
<p>Cheirodendron trigynum var. osteostigma, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has three stigmas, which is reflected in its scientific name, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to tidal zones and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
