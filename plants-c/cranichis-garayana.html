<p>Cranichis garayana, commonly known as the Garay's spider orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
