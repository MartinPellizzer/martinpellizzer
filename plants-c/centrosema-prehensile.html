                    <h1>Centrosema prehensile</h1>
<p>Centrosema prehensile, commonly known as the climbing peanut vine, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has a climbing habit, supported by its prehensile stems that grasp onto structures for support. Its seed pods contain edible seeds, which are similar to peanuts in appearance and flavor.</p>
<p>Centrosema prehensile is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
