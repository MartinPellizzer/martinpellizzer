<p>Caconapea appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale yellow and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
