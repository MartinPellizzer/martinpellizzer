<p>Cleyera integrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with smooth or slightly toothed margins, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Cleyera integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
