<p>Cypripedium irapeanum, commonly known as the Irapean lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, upright stem with broad, leathery leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
