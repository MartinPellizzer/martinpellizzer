<p>Corispermum pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's corispermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. The plant has small, green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers that develop into dry, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high salinity.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological resilience and potential for use in phytoremediation.</p>
