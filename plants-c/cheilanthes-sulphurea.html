                    <h1>Cheilanthes sulphurea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are typically gray-green to silver in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or granite outcrops.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is a common sight in desert landscapes.</p>
