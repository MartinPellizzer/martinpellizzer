                    <h1>Cytisus austriacus var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Cytisus austriacus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered in short, grayish hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Small yellow flowers appear in loose racemes during late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils.</p>
