                    <h1>Ceanothus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus microphyllus, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish-white fuzz, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue to lavender flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular plant in native gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
