<p>Coilonox, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Coilonox is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
