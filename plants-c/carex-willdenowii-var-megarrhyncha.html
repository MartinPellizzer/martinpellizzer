                    <h1>Carex willdenowii var. megarrhyncha</h1>
<p>Carex willdenowii var. megarrhyncha, commonly known as the broad-beak sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of several spikelets, each containing small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
