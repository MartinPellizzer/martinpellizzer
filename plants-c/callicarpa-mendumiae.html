                    <h1>Callicarpa mendumiae</h1>
<p>Callicarpa mendumiae, commonly known as the redcurrant bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its clusters of small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble currants. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pink, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, though some sources suggest it may have a mild tart flavor and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
