                    <h1>Chondrorhyncha estradae</h1>
<p>Chondrorhyncha estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's coralroot, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. Its unique ecological niche makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant-fungus interactions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in very specific microhabitats.</p>
