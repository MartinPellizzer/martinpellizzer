<p>Calamagrostis tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf giant reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that produce panicles of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of wetland conditions.</p>
