                    <h1>Croton ivohibensis var. ankaranaensis</h1>
<p>Croton ivohibensis var. ankaranaensis, commonly known as the Ankarana croton, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Ankarana Reserve in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, adapting to the unique geological conditions of its habitat. The plant features distinctive, palmate leaves with a velvety texture and a range of colors from green to reddish-brown. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental threats.</p>
