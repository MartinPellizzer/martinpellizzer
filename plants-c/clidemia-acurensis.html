                    <h1>Clidemia acurensis</h1>
<p>Clidemia acurensis, commonly known as the acute-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the wet tropical forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host tree through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by various pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can attach to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread.</p>
