                    <h1>Clematis sericea</h1>
<p>Clematis sericea, commonly known as silver vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vigorous, ornamental climber.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators, and its rapid growth makes it ideal for covering trellises or arbors.</p>
