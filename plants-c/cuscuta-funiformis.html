                    <h1>Cuscuta funiformis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta funiformis, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
