<p>Cistanche tinctoria f. lusitanica, commonly known as the red Chinese parasitic vine, is a halophytic plant native to arid and saline environments in China and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various plants. The plant is characterized by its reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces yellow flowers and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported tonic and aphrodisiac properties.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
