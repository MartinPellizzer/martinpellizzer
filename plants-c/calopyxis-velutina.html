<p>Calopyxis velutina, commonly known as the velvet calopyxis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts certain pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calopyxis velutina is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
