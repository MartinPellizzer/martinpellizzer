                    <h1>Carex glauca var. alpina</h1>
<p>Carex glauca var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, a common adaptation in alpine flora. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions.</p>
