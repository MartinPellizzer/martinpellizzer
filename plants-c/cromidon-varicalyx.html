<p>Cromidon varicalyx, commonly known as the variable cromidon, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cromidon varicalyx is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
