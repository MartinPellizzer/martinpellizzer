<p>Cyanea selachicauda, commonly known as the shark-tail orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that resemble the tail of a shark, hence its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. Cyanea selachicauda is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
