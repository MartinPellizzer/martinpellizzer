                    <h1>Clematis longicauda</h1>
<p>Clematis longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or blue. Its long, trailing stems make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Clematis longicauda is relatively low maintenance but requires well-draining soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth.</p>
