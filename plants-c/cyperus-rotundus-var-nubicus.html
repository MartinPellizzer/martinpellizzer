                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. nubicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. nubicus, commonly known as the African sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, nut-like fruits. Its extensive root system allows it to colonize disturbed soils and waterlogged areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
