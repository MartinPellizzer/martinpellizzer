                    <h1>Chrysocoma phosphorica</h1>
<p>Chrysocoma phosphorica, commonly known as the phosphorescent chrysocoma, is a unique plant species characterized by its bioluminescent properties.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions in South Africa, it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant's leaves and stems emit a faint blue-green glow, which is attributed to the presence of luciferin and luciferase compounds. This bioluminescence is most noticeable at night, making it a rare and fascinating botanical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat contribute to its status as an endangered species.</p>
