                    <h1>Carex helodes f. biligularis</h1>
<p>Carex helodes f. biligularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and tapering, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the edges.</p>
<p>This sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
