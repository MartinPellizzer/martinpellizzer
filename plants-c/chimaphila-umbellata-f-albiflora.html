<p>Chimaphila umbellata f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower star moss, is a rare and unique variant of the star moss plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical red or orange blooms of the species. This plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States, typically found in acidic, moist soils. It thrives in shaded forest understories and is often associated with rich, organic soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
