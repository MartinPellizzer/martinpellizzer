<p>Cremolobus suffruticosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cremolobus suffruticosus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals in its native habitat.</p>
