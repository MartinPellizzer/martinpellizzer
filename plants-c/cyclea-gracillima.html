                    <h1>Cyclea gracillima</h1>
<p>Cyclea gracillima, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Cyclea gracillima is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
