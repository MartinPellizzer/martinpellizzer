                    <h1>Cryptandra scoparia var. microcephala</h1>
<p>Cryptandra scoparia var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, glandular foliage. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more rounded flower heads compared to other Cryptandra species.</p>
