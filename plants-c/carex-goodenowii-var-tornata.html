                    <h1>Carex goodenowii var. tornata</h1>
<p>Carex goodenowii var. tornata, commonly known as the Tornate sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is a valuable component of riparian and wetland restoration projects.</p>
