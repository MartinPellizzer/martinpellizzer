<p>Catasetum taquariense var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered tiger orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals and a unique, elongated lip that resembles a tiger's face, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
