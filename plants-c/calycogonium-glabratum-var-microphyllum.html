                    <h1>Calycogonium glabratum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Calycogonium glabratum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved calycogonium, is a unique variant of the calycogonium species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, with leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
