                    <h1>Chaetocyperus viviparus</h1>
<p>Chaetocyperus viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous flatsedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of bulbils, which allow for vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Chaetocyperus viviparus make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
