                    <h1>Cissus prostrata</h1>
<p>Cissus prostrata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its ability to climb and spread rapidly makes it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments.</p>
