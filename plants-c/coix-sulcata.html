                    <h1>Coix sulcata</h1>
<p>Coix sulcata, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that develop into three-lobed, spiky fruits. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and rice paddies. Coix sulcata is also valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy soils.</p>
