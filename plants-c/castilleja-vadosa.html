<p>Castilleja vadosa, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja vadosa is often found in association with other hemiparasitic species, contributing to the ecological complexity of its environment.</p>
