                    <h1>Cabomba aquatica</h1>
<p>Cabomba aquatica, commonly known as water cabbage, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with some submerged foliage that aids in oxygenation. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Cabomba aquatica is often used in pond landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
