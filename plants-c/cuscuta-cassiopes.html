                    <h1>Cuscuta cassiopes</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cassiopes, commonly known as the redstem dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on shrubs such as heather and willow. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in some ecological contexts.</p>
