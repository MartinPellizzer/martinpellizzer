                    <h1>Cupressus lusitanica var. uhdeana</h1>
<p>Cupressus lusitanica var. uhdeana, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a variety of the narrow-leaved cypress native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that turns a rich blue-green color in the summer. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a specimen plant in gardens and parks.</p>
