                    <h1>Cenia discolor</h1>
<p>Cenia discolor, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, elongated leaves that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
