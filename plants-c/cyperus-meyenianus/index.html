<p>Cyperus meyenianus is a species of sedge commonly found in wetland environments across tropical and subtropical regions. It is known for its tall, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in moist soils. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its presence often indicates healthy wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable indicator species and a potential invasive plant in certain areas.</p>
