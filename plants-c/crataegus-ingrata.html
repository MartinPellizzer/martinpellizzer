                    <h1>Crataegus ingrata</h1>
<p>Crataegus ingrata, commonly known as the bitter hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are typically inedible due to their high acidity and bitter taste. Crataegus ingrata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
