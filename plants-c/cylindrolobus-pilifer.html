                    <h1>Cylindrolobus pilifer</h1>
<p>Cylindrolobus pilifer, commonly known as the hairy cylinder lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive morphology.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a dense covering of short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The lower surface is pale yellow to orange, with numerous isidia and soredia, which are involved in asexual reproduction. It typically grows on soil, stone, or bark in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
