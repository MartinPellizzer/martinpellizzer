<p>Cerastium arvensiforme var. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are hairy and often have glandular dots, which give the plant its "glandulosum" designation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
