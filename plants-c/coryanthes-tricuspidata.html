                    <h1>Coryanthes tricuspidata</h1>
<p>Coryanthes tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed lobster claw, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid, claw-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a unique structure called a resupinate flower, where the lip is twisted around the column, a feature common in orchids. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Coryanthes tricuspidata is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
