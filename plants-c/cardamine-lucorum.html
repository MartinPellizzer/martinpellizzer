<p>Cardamine lucorum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp, shaded areas such as stream sides and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the water's surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem.</p>
<p>Cardamine lucorum plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>
