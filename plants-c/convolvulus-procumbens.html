                    <h1>Convolvulus procumbens</h1>
<p>Convolvulus procumbens, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a low-growing annual vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
