                    <h1>Cyclosorus oblanceolatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus oblanceolatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread along the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its small, spore-bearing structures are typically found on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus oblanceolatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
