                    <h1>Cladothrix lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Cladothrix lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky sheath algae, is a freshwater cyanobacterium characterized by its filamentous structure and distinctive mucilaginous sheath.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like colonies on submerged surfaces such as rocks and aquatic plants. The plant exhibits a branching pattern with cylindrical cells covered in a thick, fibrous layer that gives it a silky appearance. It is capable of nitrogen fixation and plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cladothrix lanuginosa thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often in nutrient-rich habitats.</p>
