<p>Cremanthodium pyrolifolium, commonly known as the alpine everlasting or alpine pyrola, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often basal and arranged in a rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched and bear the showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
