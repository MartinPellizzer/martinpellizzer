                    <h1>Canschi</h1>
<p>Canschi, commonly known as the golden dewdrop or *Orobanche coerulescens*, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, often attaching itself to species like *Atriplex* or *Chenopodium*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its host's foliage. Its root system is highly specialized, forming haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
