<p>Caralluma elata, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
