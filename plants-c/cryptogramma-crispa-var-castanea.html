                    <h1>Cryptogramma crispa var. castanea</h1>
<p>Cryptogramma crispa var. castanea, commonly known as the golden cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive golden hue, which sets it apart from other cryptogramma species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
