<p>Calpidisca humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and often yellow or white, emerging from the water's surface.</p>
<p>Calpidisca humboldtii is native to South America and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
