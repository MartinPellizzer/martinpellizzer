                    <h1>Cyathocalyx</h1>
<p>Cyathocalyx, commonly known as the cup-shaped calyx, is a botanical structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the family Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>It is a modified leaf that encloses the flower and serves as a protective covering. The cyathocalyx is often mistaken for a flower itself due to its cup-like appearance. It typically consists of several fused leaf-like structures that form a tubular or cup-shaped envelope.</p>
<p>This unique feature plays a role in attracting pollinators and protecting the reproductive organs of the plant.</p>
