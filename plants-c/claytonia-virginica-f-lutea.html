                    <h1>Claytonia virginica f. lutea</h1>
<p>Claytonia virginica f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the more common white or pink flowers of the typical Claytonia virginica.</p>
