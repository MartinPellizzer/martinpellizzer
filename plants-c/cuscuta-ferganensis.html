                    <h1>Cuscuta ferganensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces tiny, dry fruits that contain seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years. It is native to Central Asia and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and evolution.</p>
