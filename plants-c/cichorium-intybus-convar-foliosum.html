<p>Cichorium intybus convar. foliosum, commonly known as the leaf chicory, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears blue or purple flowers. The plant is known for its bitter taste, which comes from compounds such as lutein and sesquiterpene lactones. It is often cultivated for its leaves, which can be used in salads or cooked, and for its roots, which are used to make coffee substitutes.</p>
<p>The plant also has medicinal uses, including as a mild diuretic and digestive aid.</p>
