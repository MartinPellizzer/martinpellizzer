                    <h1>Cypripedium × adonis</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × adonis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium × miharae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip that resembles a slipper, a characteristic feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
