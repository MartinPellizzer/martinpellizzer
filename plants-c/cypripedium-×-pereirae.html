                    <h1>Cypripedium × pereirae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × pereirae, commonly known as the Pereira's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
