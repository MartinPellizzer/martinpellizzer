                    <h1>Cerastium polymorphum var. mollifolium</h1>
<p>Cerastium polymorphum var. mollifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations.</p>
