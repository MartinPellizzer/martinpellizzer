<p>Cyperus tisserantioides, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus tisserantioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
