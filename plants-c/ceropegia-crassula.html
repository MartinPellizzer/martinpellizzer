<p>Ceropegia crassula, commonly known as the Fatshedera, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are pollinated by specific insects. Its growth habit is trailing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Ceropegia crassula requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
