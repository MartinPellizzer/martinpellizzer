<p>Calanthe chrysoleuca, commonly known as the golden-leaved calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or gold, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. Calanthe chrysoleuca prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
