<p>Cupressus thyoides subsp.</p>
<p>henryae, commonly known as the Henry's incense-cedar, is a subspecies of the western red cedar. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties. Native to the western United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of durable timber.</p>
