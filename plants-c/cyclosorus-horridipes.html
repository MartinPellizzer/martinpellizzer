<p>Cyclosorus horridipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure, which helps it thrive in wetland environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered with fine, hairy structures that give it its common name.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus horridipes is often found in shallow, still waters and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats.</p>
