<p>Cyclosorus curtus, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, orbicular fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus curtus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
