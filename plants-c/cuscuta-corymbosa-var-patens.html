                    <h1>Cuscuta corymbosa var. patens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta corymbosa var. patens, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
