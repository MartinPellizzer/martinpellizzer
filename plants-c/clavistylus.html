<p>Clavistylus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often white or pink flowers and their milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Clavistylus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They have opposite, simple leaves and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ecological role, providing nectar for specific pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species.</p>
