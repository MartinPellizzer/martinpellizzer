                    <h1>Cephalophyllum regale</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum regale, commonly known as the royal cephalophyllum, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the top of its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern at the base, forming a dense, compact structure. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to high-altitude environments, including thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophyllum regale is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
