                    <h1>Cakile edentula var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Cakile edentula var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule that disperses easily by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
