                    <h1>Cuscuta yunckeriana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta yunckeriana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked.</p>
