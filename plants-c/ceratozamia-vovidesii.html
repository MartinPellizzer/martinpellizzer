<p>Ceratozamia vovidesii, commonly known as the Vovides cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern Mexico, specifically in the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potos√≠. This cycad is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ceratozamia vovidesii is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs.</p>
