                    <h1>Coryanthes selbyana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes selbyana, commonly known as the Selby's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a unique structure with a central column and a lip that often displays vibrant colors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of flies and beetles, which are attracted by the plant's strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Coryanthes selbyana is also notable for its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
