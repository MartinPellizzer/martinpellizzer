                    <h1>Cicuta virosa f. latisecta</h1>
<p>Cicuta virosa f. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to moist, often boggy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like, bipinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of theApiaceae family. It contains toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and resemblance to other plants, it is often mistaken for edible species, making it a hazardous plant to handle or consume.</p>
