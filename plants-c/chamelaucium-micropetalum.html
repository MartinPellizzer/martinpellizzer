<p>Chamelaucium micropetalum, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by fire, a common ecological trigger in its habitat.</p>
<p>Chamelaucium micropetalum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
