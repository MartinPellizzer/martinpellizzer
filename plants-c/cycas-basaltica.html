                    <h1>Cycas basaltica</h1>
<p>Cycas basaltica, commonly known as the basalt cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas basaltica is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
