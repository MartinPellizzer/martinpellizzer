<p>Corymbia trachyphloia subsp.</p>
<p>amphistomatica, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in spring, followed by woody, edible fruits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands.</p>
