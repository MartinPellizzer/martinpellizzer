                    <h1>Caryodaphnopsis quanbaensis</h1>
<p>Caryodaphnopsis quanbaensis, commonly known as the Quanbaensis cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
