<p>Calligonum leucocladum var. flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, mat-like growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
