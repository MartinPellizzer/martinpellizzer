<p>Cardamine monticola, commonly known as mountain watercress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
