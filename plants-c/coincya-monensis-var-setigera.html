                    <h1>Coincya monensis var. setigera</h1>
<p>Coincya monensis var. setigera, commonly known as the hairy water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by reducing algae growth.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust and hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Coincya monensis.</p>
