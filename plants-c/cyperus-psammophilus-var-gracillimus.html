<p>Cyperus psammophilus var. gracillimus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects in sandy environments.</p>
