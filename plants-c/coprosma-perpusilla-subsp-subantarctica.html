<p>Coprosma perpusilla subsp.</p>
<p>subantarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic coprosma, is a low-growing shrub native to the subantarctic islands of New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
