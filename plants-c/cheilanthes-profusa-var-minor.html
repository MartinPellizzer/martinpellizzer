                    <h1>Cheilanthes profusa var. minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes profusa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaf structure. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense colonies in harsh environments.</p>
