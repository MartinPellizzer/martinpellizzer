<p>Chilita glochidiata, commonly known as the giant cactus or giant hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in small, spine-like structures called glochids, which are often more numerous and less rigid than typical cactus spines.</p>
<p>Chilita glochidiata is adapted to arid environments and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
