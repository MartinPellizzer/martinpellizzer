                    <h1>Cinchona orixensis</h1>
<p>Cinchona orixensis, commonly known as the Sierra Leone cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to western Africa, particularly found in countries like Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is often grown for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to those found in other cinchona species.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant compared to other cinchona varieties due to its limited distribution and lower yields.</p>
