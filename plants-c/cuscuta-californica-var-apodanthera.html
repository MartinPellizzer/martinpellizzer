                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. apodanthera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. apodanthera, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
