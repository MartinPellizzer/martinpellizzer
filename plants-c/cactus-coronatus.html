                    <h1>Cactus coronatus</h1>
<p>Cactus coronatus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that form a dense, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often surrounded by a crown-like arrangement of bracts. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus coronatus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
