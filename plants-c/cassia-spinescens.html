<p>Cassia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny cassia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spine-like thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow, papery flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>Cassia spinescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
