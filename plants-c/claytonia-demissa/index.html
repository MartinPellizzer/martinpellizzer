                            <h1>Claytonia Demissa</h1>
<p>Spring beauty, scientifically known as Claytonia demissa, is a delicate wildflower that blooms in early spring across North America. It is named for its striking appearance, which resembles a cluster of tiny white flowers with a pinkish tinge. This plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Despite its small size, it plays an important role in supporting early pollinators. Its short flowering period makes it a symbol of the fleeting beauty of spring.</p>
