The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation.</p>
