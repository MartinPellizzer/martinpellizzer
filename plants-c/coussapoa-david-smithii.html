                    <h1>Coussapoa david-smithii</h1>
<p>Coussapoa david-smithii, commonly known as the David-Smith's coussapoa, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features striking, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention in its humid, montane habitat. Its inflorescence consists of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
