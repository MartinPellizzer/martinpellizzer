                    <h1>Cyperus recurvatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus recurvatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. Cyperus recurvatus thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for erosion control in aquatic habitats.</p>
