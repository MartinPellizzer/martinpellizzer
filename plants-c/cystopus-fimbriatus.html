<p>Cystopus fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Cystopus fimbriatus is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the control of microorganism populations.</p>
