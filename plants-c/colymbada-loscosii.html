                    <h1>Colymbada loscosii</h1>
<p>Colymbada loscosii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Colymbada loscosii is considered critically endangered.</p>
