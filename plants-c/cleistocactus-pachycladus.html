                    <h1>Cleistocactus pachycladus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus pachycladus, commonly known as the rock cactus or the stone cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that emerge from the stem during the spring and summer months. Its spiny, ribbed structure helps it survive in harsh, dry environments by reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus pachycladus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
