                    <h1>Cuviera caput-medusae</h1>
<p>Cuviera caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous fleshy, spiny branches that resemble a crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in hot climates.</p>
<p>Cuviera caput-medusae is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
