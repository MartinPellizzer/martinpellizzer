<p>Coccothrinax argentea subsp.</p>
<p>guantanamensis, commonly known as the Guant√°namo silver palm, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba. It is a small, slow-growing palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves with a silvery-blue hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, followed by black, spherical fruits. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
