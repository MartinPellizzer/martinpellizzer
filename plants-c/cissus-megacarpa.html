<p>Cissus megacarpa, commonly known as the giant grape ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy bumps, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits resembling grapes, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage, it is often used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
