<p>Cristonia biloba, commonly known as the laceleaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage composed of tiny, overlapping leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cristonia biloba is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
