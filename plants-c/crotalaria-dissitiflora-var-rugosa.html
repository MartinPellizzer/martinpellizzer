                    <h1>Crotalaria dissitiflora var. rugosa</h1>
<p>Crotalaria dissitiflora var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
