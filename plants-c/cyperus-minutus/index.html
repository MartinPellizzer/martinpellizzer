                            <h1>Cyperus Minutus</h1>
<p>Minute sedge, scientifically known as Cyperus minutus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in dense clusters. Despite its modest appearance, this plant plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Its ability to thrive in moist conditions makes it a common sight in many aquatic and semi-aquatic regions. Due to its resilience and adaptability, the minute sedge is both a valuable indicator species and a subject of ongoing botanical study.</p>
