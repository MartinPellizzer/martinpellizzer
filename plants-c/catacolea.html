                    <h1>Catacolea</h1>
<p>Catacolea, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. They are typically slow-growing and have a long lifespan, often surviving for several decades. Catacolea species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ancient lineage make them important subjects in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
