                    <h1>Cunonia × koghicola</h1>
<p>Cunonia × koghicola, commonly known as the hybrid cunonia, is a plant resulting from the crossbreeding of two species within the Cunonia genus.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its dense foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Cunonia × koghicola is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
