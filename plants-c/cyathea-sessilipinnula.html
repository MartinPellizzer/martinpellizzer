<p>Cyathea sessilipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-pinnuled tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, lush appearance.</p>
<p>Cyathea sessilipinnula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
