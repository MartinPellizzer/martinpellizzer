                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. coelata</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. coelata, commonly known as the silver filbert or white filbert, is a variant of the hazelnut tree characterized by its striking white to silver foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental variety is native to Europe and is cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its nuts. The leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, similar to other hazelnut species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in garden landscapes for its unique foliage color.</p>
