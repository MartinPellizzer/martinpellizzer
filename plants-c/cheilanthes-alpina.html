                    <h1>Cheilanthes alpina</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes alpina, commonly known as the alpine lip fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes alpina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates.</p>
