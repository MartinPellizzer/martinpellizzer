                    <h1>Claytonia adsurgens</h1>
<p>Claytonia adsurgens, commonly known as the bouncing plant or spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its unique ability to "bounce" when disturbed is due to its flexible, springy stems.</p>
<p>Claytonia adsurgens thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
