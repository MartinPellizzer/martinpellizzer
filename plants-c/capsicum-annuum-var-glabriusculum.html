                    <h1>Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum</h1>
<p>Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the wild chili pepper, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, though the variety name "glabriusculum" suggests a somewhat reduced pubescence compared to other varieties. It is a herbaceous annual plant that thrives in warm, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated chili peppers.</p>
