                    <h1>Cyperus aurifer</h1>
<p>Cyperus aurifer, commonly known as golden flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often adorned with golden or reddish bracts. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus aurifer is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems.</p>
