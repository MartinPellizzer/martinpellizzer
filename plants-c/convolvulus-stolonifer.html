                    <h1>Convolvulus stolonifer</h1>
<p>Convolvulus stolonifer, commonly known as the spreading bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Convolvulus stolonifer is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature and persistent seed production.</p>
