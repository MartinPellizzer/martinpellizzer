                    <h1>Chrysocyathus tianshanicus</h1>
<p>Chrysocyathus tianshanicus, commonly known as the Tianshan golden cup, is a rare and unique species of marine sponge found in the waters around the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow coloration and intricate, cup-like skeletal structure composed of silica. This sponge thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its delicate structure makes it sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for water quality.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its habitat.</p>
