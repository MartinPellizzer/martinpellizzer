                    <h1>Cerastium beeringianum var. aleuticum</h1>
<p>Cerastium beeringianum var. aleuticum, commonly known as the Aleut mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a distinctive, compact inflorescence. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to cold climates include a short growing season and a deep root system for water retention.</p>
