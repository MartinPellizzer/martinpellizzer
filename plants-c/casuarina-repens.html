                    <h1>Casuarina repens</h1>
<p>Casuarina repens, commonly known as the weeping casuarina, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with slender, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of conifers. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in spring. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Casuarina repens is also valued for its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments.</p>
