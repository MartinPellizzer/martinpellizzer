<p>Cyathea asperata var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to their serrated margins. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
