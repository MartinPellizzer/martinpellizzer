                    <h1>Ctenitis silvatica</h1>
<p>Ctenitis silvatica, commonly known as the silvan ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into fine, hairpin-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ctenitis silvatica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
