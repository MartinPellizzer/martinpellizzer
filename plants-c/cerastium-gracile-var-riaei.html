                    <h1>Cerastium gracile var. riaei</h1>
<p>Cerastium gracile var. riaei, commonly known as the coastal mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. It is often found in dunes, cliffs, and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions make it a characteristic component of coastal flora.</p>
