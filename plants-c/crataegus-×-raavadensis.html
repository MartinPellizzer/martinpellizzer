                    <h1>Crataegus × raavadensis</h1>
<p>Crataegus × raavadensis, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. The leaves are typically oval to ovate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and its fruit, a small red berry, is an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
