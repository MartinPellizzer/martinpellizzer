                    <h1>Cycas</h1>
<p>Cycas, commonly known as sago palms, are ancient seed plants that have existed since the Mesozoic era.</p>
<p>They are gymnosperms, characterized by their lack of flowers and the production of cones instead of fruits. Cycas species typically have a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves. Their leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions and are valued for their ornamental appeal.</p>
