<p>Ctenopteris burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near water bodies. Its unique light-emitting property is due to specialized structures called chromatophores.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris burbidgei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to purify water in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
