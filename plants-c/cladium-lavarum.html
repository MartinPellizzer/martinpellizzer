<p>Cladium lavarum, commonly known as the mangrove sedges, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland and coastal environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Cladium lavarum is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in saline or brackish water conditions. The plant's rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in muddy or tidal areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in mangrove and estuarine ecosystems.</p>
