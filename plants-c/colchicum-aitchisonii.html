                    <h1>Colchicum aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Colchicum aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's colchicum, is a rare and striking member of the Colchicaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers in late summer, with reflexed petals and a distinctive spurred shape. Its bulbous corm is adapted for survival in harsh alpine climates, allowing it to endure periods of dormancy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
