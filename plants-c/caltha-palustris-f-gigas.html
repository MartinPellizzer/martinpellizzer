                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. gigas</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. gigas, commonly known as the giant marsh marigold, is a striking perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often emerging through snow-covered ground. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>While it is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, it differs from the typical C. palustris by its notably larger size and more robust floral display.</p>
