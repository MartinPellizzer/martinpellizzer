The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soil. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
