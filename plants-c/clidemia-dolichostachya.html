                    <h1>Clidemia dolichostachya</h1>
<p>Clidemia dolichostachya, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and often grows on the branches of other trees, drawing nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
