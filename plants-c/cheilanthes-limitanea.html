<p>Cheilanthes limitanea, commonly known as the desert fern, is a species of lithophyte found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes limitanea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
