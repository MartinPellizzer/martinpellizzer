                    <h1>Callianthe bezerrae</h1>
<p>Callianthe bezerrae, commonly known as the Bezerra's star cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the stem apex. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Callianthe bezerrae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
