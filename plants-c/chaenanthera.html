                    <h1>Chaenanthera</h1>
<p>Chaenanthera, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Chaenanthera species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects and small animals.</p>
