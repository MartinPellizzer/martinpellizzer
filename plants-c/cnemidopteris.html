                    <h1>Cnemidopteris</h1>
<p>Cnemidopteris, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tree-like appearance, with fronds that resemble antlers, giving them their common name. They typically grow on trees or rocks, using their rhizomes to anchor themselves without relying on soil. Cnemidopteris species are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ability to thrive in humid environments make them popular in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
