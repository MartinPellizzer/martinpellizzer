The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cycas longlinensis is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
