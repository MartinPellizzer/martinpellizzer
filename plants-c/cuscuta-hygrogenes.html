                    <h1>Cuscuta hygrogenes</h1>
<p>Cuscuta hygrogenes, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on agricultural crops such as corn and soybeans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
