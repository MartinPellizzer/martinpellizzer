                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris umensis</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris umensis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters and has hairy, alternate leaves that are often succulent. The plant produces small, round seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a mechanism known as explosive dehiscence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and genetics.</p>
