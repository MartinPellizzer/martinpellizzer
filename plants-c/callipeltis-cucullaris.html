                    <h1>Callipeltis cucullaris</h1>
<p>Callipeltis cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded tephritid, is a species of fruit fly found primarily in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tephritidae and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure over the head. The plant it is associated with, typically a member of the Solanaceae family, provides the larvae with a suitable environment for development. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the fruit, which then hatch into larvae that feed on the pulp.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat through its interactions with host plants and other organisms.</p>
