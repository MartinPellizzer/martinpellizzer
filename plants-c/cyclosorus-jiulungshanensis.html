<p>Cyclosorus jiulungshanensis, commonly known as the Jiulungshan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern endemic to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves with four lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation.</p>
