<p>Corrigiola propinqua, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal dunes and gravelly areas. The plant has small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
