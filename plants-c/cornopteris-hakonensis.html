<p>Cornopteris hakonensis, commonly known as the Hakonese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Cornopteris hakonensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
