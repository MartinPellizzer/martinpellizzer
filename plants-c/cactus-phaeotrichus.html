<p>Cactus phaeotrichus, commonly known as the silver spurge cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus phaeotrichus is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
