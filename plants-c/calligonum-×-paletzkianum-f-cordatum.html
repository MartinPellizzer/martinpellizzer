<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It is a shrub or small tree, often found in saline or sandy soils, and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing desertification.</p>
