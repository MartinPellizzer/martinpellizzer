<p>Carex glauca f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-stem sedgeland, is a variant of the blue sedge.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glaucous, bluish-green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers.</p>
