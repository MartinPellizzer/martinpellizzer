                    <h1>Cactus subpolyedrus</h1>
<p>Cactus subpolyedrus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, narrow ribs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for efficient photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Overall, Cactus subpolyedrus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and nutrients.</p>
