                            <h1>Cylichnanthus Maculatus</h1>
<p>Red-tipped pygmy maple, scientifically known as Cylichnanthus maculatus, is a small, ornamental tree native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. This unique plant is prized for its striking red-tipped leaves that contrast beautifully with its glossy green foliage. Though it grows slowly, it can reach a height of about 10 feet, making it ideal for small gardens or container planting. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a popular choice among horticulturists and landscape designers. Despite its beauty, it requires specific care to thrive, including well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
