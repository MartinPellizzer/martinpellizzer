                    <h1>Craterosiphon montanus</h1>
<p>Craterosiphon montanus, commonly known as the mountain rockweed, is a member of the Ulvaceae family and is characterized by its filamentous, thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, often found in intertidal zones where it can withstand fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. The plant exhibits a dark green to brownish coloration, with a smooth, leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal substrates and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
