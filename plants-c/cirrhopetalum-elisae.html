                    <h1>Cirrhopetalum elisae</h1>
<p>Cirrhopetalum elisae, commonly known as the Elisae's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated petals that resemble flowing ribbons. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives in the dappled light. Its flowers are usually a combination of white and pink, with a distinctive, curling lip that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum elisae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
