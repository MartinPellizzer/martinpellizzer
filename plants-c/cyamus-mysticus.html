                    <h1>Cyamus mysticus</h1>
<p>Cyamus mysticus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, instead deriving nutrients from the air and water. The plant's roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients through mycorrhizal associations. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring a humid, shaded environment with consistently moist air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Cyamus mysticus is considered endangered, making it a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
