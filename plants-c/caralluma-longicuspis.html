                    <h1>Caralluma longicuspis</h1>
<p>Caralluma longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma longicuspis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>
