<p>Ceropegia nitida, commonly known as the silver leaf ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thin, fleshy, and often hairy stems that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ceropegia nitida thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
