<p>Chrysocycnis ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian golden cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper portion of the stem. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
