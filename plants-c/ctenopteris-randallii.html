                    <h1>Ctenopteris randallii</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris randallii, commonly known as the Randall's sea palm, is a species of marine fern found in the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are adapted to withstand strong wave action. The plant thrives in shallow, rocky intertidal zones, where it attaches itself to substrates using its rhizomes. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris randallii plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
