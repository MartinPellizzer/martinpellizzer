<p>Cynosurus ciliaris, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has fine, narrow leaves with silky hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Cynosurus ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
