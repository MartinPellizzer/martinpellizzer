<p>Cephalotaxus drupacea var. harringtonia, commonly known as the Harrington's Yew, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It features a slow-growing, compact form with dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a unique, almost shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
