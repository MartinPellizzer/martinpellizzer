                    <h1>Cuscuta scandens var. bidentis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta scandens var. bidentis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed leaves, which are often mistaken for stem structures. It is found in various habitats, including gardens and agricultural fields, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
