                    <h1>Cyclandrophora elliptica</h1>
<p>Cyclandrophora elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cyclandrophora elliptica thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
