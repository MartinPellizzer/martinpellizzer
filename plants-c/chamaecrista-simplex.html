<p>Chamaecrista simplex, commonly known as the smallflower ticktree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often accompanied by distinctive, feather-like leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Chamaecrista simplex is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
