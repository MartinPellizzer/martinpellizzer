                    <h1>Cavendishia quercina</h1>
<p>Cavendishia quercina, commonly known as the oakleaf cactus, is a unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a cactus and a species of Euphorbia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its common name. It is native to the arid regions of South America, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
