                    <h1>Chassalia umbraticola</h1>
<p>Chassalia umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy chassalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor, forming dense patches in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chassalia umbraticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
