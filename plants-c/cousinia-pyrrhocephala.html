                    <h1>Cousinia pyrrhocephala</h1>
<p>Cousinia pyrrhocephala, commonly known as the red-headed cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Cousinia pyrrhocephala is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
