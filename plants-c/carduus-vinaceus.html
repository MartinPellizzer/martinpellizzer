                    <h1>Carduus vinaceus</h1>
<p>Carduus vinaceus, commonly known as the red cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
