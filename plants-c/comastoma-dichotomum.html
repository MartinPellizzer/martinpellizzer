                    <h1>Comastoma dichotomum</h1>
<p>Comastoma dichotomum, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Comastoma dichotomum is a carnivorous plant, adapting to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey.</p>
