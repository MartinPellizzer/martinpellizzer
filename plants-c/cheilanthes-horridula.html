                    <h1>Cheilanthes horridula</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes horridula, commonly known as the rough fringed bladder fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, wiry rhizomes and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in crevices and on rock faces in desert environments.</p>
