                    <h1>Carex weiheana</h1>
<p>Carex weiheana, commonly known as the Weihe's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, and thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant produces upright, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are typical of the sedge genus. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Carex weiheana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
