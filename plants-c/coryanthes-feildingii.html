<p>Coryanthes feildingii, commonly known as the Fielding's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a vivid red color with contrasting yellow and green markings. The plant produces a unique, elongated lip that serves as a landing platform for its pollinators, primarily bees and wasps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
