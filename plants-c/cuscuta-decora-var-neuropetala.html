                    <h1>Cuscuta decora var. neuropetala</h1>
<p>Cuscuta decora var. neuropetala, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the morning. The plant has a slender, winding stem that twines around its host, forming a dense network of parasitic connections. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is native to North America and is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
