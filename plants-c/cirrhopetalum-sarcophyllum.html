                    <h1>Cirrhopetalum sarcophyllum</h1>
<p>Cirrhopetalum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wet, swampy habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and highly protected.</p>
