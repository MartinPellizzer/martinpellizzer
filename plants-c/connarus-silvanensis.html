                    <h1>Connarus silvanensis</h1>
<p>Connarus silvanensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-gray bark and small, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is highly valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and used in construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
