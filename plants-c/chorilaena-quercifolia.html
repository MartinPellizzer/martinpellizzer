                    <h1>Chorilaena quercifolia</h1>
<p>Chorilaena quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cholla, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and modified stems that function as spines, providing protection from herbivores. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to a point, typical of many cacti and related species. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters and appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Chorilaena quercifolia is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
