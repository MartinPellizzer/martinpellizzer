                    <h1>Cephalophyllum roseum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum roseum, commonly known as the roseate headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped stem covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with pink or purple hues. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
