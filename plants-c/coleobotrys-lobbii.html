                    <h1>Coleobotrys lobbii</h1>
<p>Coleobotrys lobbii, commonly known as the Lobbâ€™s ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Coleobotrys lobbii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
