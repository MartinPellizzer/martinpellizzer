                            <h1>Cracca Barbigera</h1>
<p>Barbed cranesbill, scientifically known as Cracca barbigera, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. Its name derives from the barbed hairs on its stems and the distinctive shape of its flowers, which resemble a cranesbill. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. With its vibrant purple or pink blossoms, it adds a bold touch to wildflower gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its rugged appearance, Barbed cranesbill is valued for its resilience and ecological importance.</p>
