                    <h1>Cuscuta compacta var. efimbriata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta compacta var. efimbriata, commonly known as the fringed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its fringed appearance, with small, scale-like structures along its stem. It typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
