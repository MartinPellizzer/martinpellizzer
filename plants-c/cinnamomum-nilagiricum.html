                    <h1>Cinnamomum nilagiricum</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum nilagiricum, commonly known as the Nilgiri cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is not related botanically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique scent and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and rare species in botanical collections.</p>
