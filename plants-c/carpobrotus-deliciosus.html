<p>Carpobrotus deliciosus, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, sprawling stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
