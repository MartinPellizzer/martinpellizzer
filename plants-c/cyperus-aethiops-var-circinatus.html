                    <h1>Cyperus aethiops var. circinatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aethiops var. circinatus, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, due to its preference for moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its adaptability to varying water levels.</p>
