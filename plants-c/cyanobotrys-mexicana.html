                    <h1>Cyanobotrys mexicana</h1>
<p>Cyanobotrys mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican blue-green alga, is a freshwater cyanobacterium that thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous growth pattern and the ability to form dense mats on the surface of water bodies. This organism is capable of nitrogen fixation, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. It often blooms in response to high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen, which can lead to eutrophication.</p>
<p>Cyanobotrys mexicana plays a significant role in both ecological and potential biotechnological applications.</p>
