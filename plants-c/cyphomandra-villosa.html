                    <h1>Cyphomandra villosa</h1>
<p>Cyphomandra villosa, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains solanine, a toxic alkaloid, so it should be handled with care.</p>
