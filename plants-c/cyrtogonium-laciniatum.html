<p>Cyrtogonium laciniatum, commonly known as the slitleaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Cyrtogonium laciniatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
