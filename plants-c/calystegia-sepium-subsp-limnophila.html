<p>Calystegia sepium subsp.</p>
<p>limnophila, commonly known as water bindweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in waterlogged soils and can make it invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects.</p>
