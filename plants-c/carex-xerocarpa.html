                    <h1>Carex xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Carex xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access underground water. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Carex xerocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
