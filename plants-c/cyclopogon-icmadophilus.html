                    <h1>Cyclopogon icmadophilus</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon icmadophilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen cycad characterized by its slender trunk and feather-like leaves. Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species with ancient lineage.</p>
