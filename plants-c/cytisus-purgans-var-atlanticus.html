                    <h1>Cytisus purgans var. atlanticus</h1>
<p>Cytisus purgans var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
