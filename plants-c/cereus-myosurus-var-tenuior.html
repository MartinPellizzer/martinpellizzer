                    <h1>Cereus myosurus var. tenuior</h1>
<p>Cereus myosurus var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects.</p>
