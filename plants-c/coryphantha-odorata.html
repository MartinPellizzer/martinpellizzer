                    <h1>Coryphantha odorata</h1>
<p>Coryphantha odorata, commonly known as the fragrant coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in fine, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha odorata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
