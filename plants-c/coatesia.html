<p>Coatesia, commonly known as the "Cape goldenbush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are characterized by their bright yellow or golden flowers. Coatesia species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually arranged in dense, spherical or cylindrical heads, making them visually striking and attractive to pollinators.</p>
