                    <h1>Cyclosorus sledgei</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
