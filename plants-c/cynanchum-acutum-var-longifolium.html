<p>Cynanchum acutum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores and is considered a challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
