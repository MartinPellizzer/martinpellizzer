                    <h1>Cleistes unguiculata</h1>
<p>Cleistes unguiculata, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its urn-shaped, pitcher-like leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-rich substance to attract insects. The plant's flowers are small, white, and clustered in a raceme, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
