<p>Cousinia onopordon, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia onopordon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
