                    <h1>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis f. longispina</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis f. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its spines are long and sharp, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
