<p>Coelogyne renae, commonly known as the Renae's orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, white to pale green pubescence. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence bearing several fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Coelogyne renae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
