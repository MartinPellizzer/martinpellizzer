                    <h1>Cyperus lupulinus var. macilentus</h1>
<p>Cyperus lupulinus var. macilentus, commonly known as the slender bulbostachys, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
