<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming compact cushions of foliage. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Cousinia hermonis is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting resilience to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
