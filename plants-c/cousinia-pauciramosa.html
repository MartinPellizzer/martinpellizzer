                    <h1>Cousinia pauciramosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia pauciramosa, commonly known as the few-branched cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers in spring, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia pauciramosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
