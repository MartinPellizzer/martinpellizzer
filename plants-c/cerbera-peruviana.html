                    <h1>Cerbera peruviana</h1>
<p>Cerbera peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian apple or yellow oleander, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. These berries contain a single seed enclosed in a thick, sticky pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, Cerbera peruviana is often avoided for ornamental use despite its striking appearance.</p>
