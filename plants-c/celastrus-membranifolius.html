                    <h1>Celastrus membranifolius</h1>
<p>Celastrus membranifolius, commonly known as the paper-leaf bindweed, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval to elliptic leaves that are often thinly membranous, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
