The plant is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The fruit is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications due to its high vitamin C content and aromatic properties.</p>
