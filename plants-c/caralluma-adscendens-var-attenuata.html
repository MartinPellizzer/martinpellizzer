                    <h1>Caralluma adscendens var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Caralluma adscendens var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely arranged, fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
