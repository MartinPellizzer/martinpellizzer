<p>Chamaesium spatuliferum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chamaesium, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
