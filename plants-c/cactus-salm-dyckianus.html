                    <h1>Cactus salm-dyckianus</h1>
<p>Cactus salm-dyckianus, commonly known as the Salm-Dyck cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited to harsh environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
