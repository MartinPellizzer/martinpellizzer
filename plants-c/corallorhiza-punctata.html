                    <h1>Corallorhiza punctata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza punctata, commonly known as the dotted ladies' tresses, is an orchid species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
