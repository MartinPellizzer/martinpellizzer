<p>Conophytum lithopsoides subsp.</p>
<p>boreale, commonly known as the Southern African stone plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, stone-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
