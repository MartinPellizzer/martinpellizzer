<p>Cerbera dumicola, commonly known as the desert cerbera, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating. It is also notable for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, Cerbera dumicola is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats.</p>
