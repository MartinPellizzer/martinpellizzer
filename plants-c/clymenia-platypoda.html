                    <h1>Clymenia platypoda</h1>
<p>Clymenia platypoda, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by large, woody pods containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. Clymenia platypoda is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for numerous animals.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the nuts, contributing to the tree's reproductive success.</p>
