<p>Cyathophylla viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cyathophylla, is a member of the family Cyathophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which is a distinctive feature of the genus.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its leaves also serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
