<p>Cyclopogon iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguap√© cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, specifically in the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclopogon iguapensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
