<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
