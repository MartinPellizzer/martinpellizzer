<p>Callitriche keniensis, commonly known as Kenyan water star, is a small aquatic plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and bloom in clusters, often attracting insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Callitriche keniensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
