                    <h1>Centaurea pungens f. alobyphylla</h1>
<p>Centaurea pungens f. alobyphylla, commonly known as the pale-flowered bluemink, is a botanical variant of the common centaury.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced, pale blue to white flower heads, which contrast with the typical red or purple hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>This form is less showy than the typical variety but is valued for its unique coloration and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
