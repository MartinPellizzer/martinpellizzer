                    <h1>Cypripedium ludlowii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a dense mat of leaves and roots. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spiral and are often pink or white in color.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in its natural range.</p>
