                    <h1>Cereus flavispinus</h1>
<p>Cereus flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cereus flavispinus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
