                    <h1>Conchocarpus marginatus</h1>
<p>Conchocarpus marginatus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, white, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Its root system includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Conchocarpus marginatus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
