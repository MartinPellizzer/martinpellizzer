                    <h1>Cypripedium × orbum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × orbum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a lady's shoe, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a long flowering period, often from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or greenish throat, and it produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
