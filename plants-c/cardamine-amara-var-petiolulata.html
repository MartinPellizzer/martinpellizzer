The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are more delicate than those of the common watercress.</p>
