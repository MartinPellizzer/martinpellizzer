<p>Cytisus subspinescens var. candidus, commonly known as the white broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration, which sets it apart from the more common orange or yellow-flowered cytisus species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
