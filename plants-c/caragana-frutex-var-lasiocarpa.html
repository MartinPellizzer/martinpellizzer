<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
