                    <h1>Claytonia arctica var. chrysantha</h1>
<p>Claytonia arctica var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically succulent and have a slightly sour taste due to their high concentration of oxalic acid. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
