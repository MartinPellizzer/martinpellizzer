                    <h1>Crataegus × pseudoambigua</h1>
<p>Crataegus × pseudoambigua, commonly known as the common hawthorn or hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, exhibiting a combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Crataegus × pseudoambigua is often used in hedgerows and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
