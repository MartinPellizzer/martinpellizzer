                    <h1>Cypripedium haynaldianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium haynaldianum, commonly known as the Haynald's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few broad, ovate leaves. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
