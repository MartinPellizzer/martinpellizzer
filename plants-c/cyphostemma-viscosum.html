<p>Cyphostemma viscosum, commonly known as the sticky cyphostemma, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that exude a sticky sap when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by orange-red fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dry woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
