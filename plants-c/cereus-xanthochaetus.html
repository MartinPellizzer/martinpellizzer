<p>Cereus xanthochaetus, commonly known as the yellow-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Cereus xanthochaetus is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
