                    <h1>Calanthus multiflorus</h1>
<p>Calanthus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered calanthus, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calanthus multiflorus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily grown for its ecological benefits rather than its showy appearance.</p>
