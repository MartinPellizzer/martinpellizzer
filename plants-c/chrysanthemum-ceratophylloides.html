                    <h1>Chrysanthemum ceratophylloides</h1>
<p>Chrysanthemum ceratophylloides, commonly known as the woolly chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-white to grayish foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening.</p>
