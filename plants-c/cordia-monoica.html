<p>Cordia monoica, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and exudes a reddish sap when wounded. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Cordia monoica plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
