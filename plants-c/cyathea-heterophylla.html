                    <h1>Cyathea heterophylla</h1>
<p>Cyathea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive ability to produce two different types of fronds—sterile and fertile—on the same plant, a trait known as heterophylly. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Cyathea heterophylla plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
