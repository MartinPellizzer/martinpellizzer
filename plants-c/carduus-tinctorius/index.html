                            <h1>Carduus Tinctorius</h1>
<p>Carduus tinctorius, also known as the woad plant, has a rich history dating back thousands of years. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it was once a vital source of blue dye before synthetic alternatives took over. Its leaves and flowers contain compounds that produce a deep, lasting blue color when processed. Despite its decline in commercial use, the plant remains of interest to botanists and historians. Today, it is cultivated in some regions for its ecological benefits and potential medicinal properties.</p>
