                    <h1>Clavija myrmeciocarpa</h1>
<p>Clavija myrmeciocarpa, commonly known as the ant-track plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils makes it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The name "myrmeciocarpa" refers to its association with ants, as the plant's fruits are often found in ant trails.</p>
