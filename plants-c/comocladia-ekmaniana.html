                    <h1>Comocladia ekmaniana</h1>
<p>Comocladia ekmaniana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a rare and specialized mangrove species found primarily in the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline and waterlogged soils, including a specialized root system that filters out excess salt. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation in coastal environments. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
