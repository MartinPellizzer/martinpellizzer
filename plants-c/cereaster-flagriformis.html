<p>Cereaster flagriformis, commonly known as the flame-shaped sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinioidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like structure composed of numerous filaments that radiate from a central column. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is covered in nematocysts, specialized cells used for capturing prey and defense.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of Cereaster flagriformis is due to its colonial growth pattern, which resembles a flowering plant in structure.</p>
