                    <h1>Cotoneaster tomentosus f. pendulus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster tomentosus f. pendulus, commonly known as the weeping cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing nature and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
