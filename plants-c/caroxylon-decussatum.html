The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Caroxylon decussatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
