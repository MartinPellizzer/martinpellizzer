<p>Cuscuta approximata subsp.</p>
<p>macranthera, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a parasitic connection. It is native to North America and can be found in a variety of habitats, including fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
