<p>Carex liddonii, commonly known as Liddon's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, with male and female flowers arranged on separate spikes.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex liddonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
