<p>Casearia javitensis f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible but often have a mild, bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
