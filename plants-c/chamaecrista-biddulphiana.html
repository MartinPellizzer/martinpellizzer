                    <h1>Chamaecrista biddulphiana</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista biddulphiana, commonly known as the Biddulph's sensitiveplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to touch, the leaves often fold shut when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name.</p>
