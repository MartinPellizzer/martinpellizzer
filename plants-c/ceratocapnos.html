<p>It consists of only two species, both native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, branched inflorescences that resemble a beard, hence the common name. They typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and white or pale yellow, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
