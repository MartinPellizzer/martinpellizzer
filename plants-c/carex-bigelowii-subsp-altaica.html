<p>Carex bigelowii subsp.</p>
<p>altaica, commonly known as Bigelow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as tundra, marshes, and along streams. It has rhizomatous growth and forms dense clumps, which help stabilize soil in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
