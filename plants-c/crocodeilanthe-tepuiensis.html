                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
