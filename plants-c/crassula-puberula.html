<p>Crassula puberula, commonly known as the Wooly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly hair covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in compact, rosette formations, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Crassula puberula is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
