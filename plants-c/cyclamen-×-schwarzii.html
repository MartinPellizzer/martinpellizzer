                    <h1>Cyclamen × schwarzii</h1>
<p>Cyclamen × schwarzii, commonly known as the hybrid cyclamen, is a decorative plant characterized by its striking, heart-shaped foliage and showy, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cyclamen persicum and Cyclamen coum, resulting in a plant that combines the best traits of both parents. The flowers typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white, often with a distinctive dark blotch near the base. The plant prefers cool, bright environments and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for containers or as a bedding plant in shaded areas.</p>
