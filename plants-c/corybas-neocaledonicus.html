                    <h1>Corybas neocaledonicus</h1>
<p>Corybas neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian helmet orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Corybas, which is characterized by its distinctive, often hood-like floral structure. The plant is notable for its small, intricate flowers that typically lack traditional petals, instead featuring a specialized lip or column. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of New Caledonia's rainforests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
