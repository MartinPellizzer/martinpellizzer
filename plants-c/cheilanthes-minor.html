                    <h1>Cheilanthes minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with short, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes minor is often found growing on limestone or sandstone, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats.</p>
