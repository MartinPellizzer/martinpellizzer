                    <h1>Cassia birostris</h1>
<p>Cassia birostris, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Cassia birostris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
