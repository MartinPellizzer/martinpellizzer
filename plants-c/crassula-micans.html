<p>Crassula micans, commonly known as the glittering jade or the silver jade, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Crassula micans thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and well-draining soil.</p>
