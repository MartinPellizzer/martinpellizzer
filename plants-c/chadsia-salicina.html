<p>Chadsia salicina, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows from a fibrous root system and has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, spiny fruits, known as burrs, are designed to attach to animals or clothing for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Chadsia salicina thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>
