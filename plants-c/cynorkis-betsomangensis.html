                    <h1>Cynorkis betsomangensis</h1>
<p>Cynorkis betsomangensis, commonly known as the Betsomang cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
