                    <h1>Commelina bracteolata</h1>
<p>Commelina bracteolata, commonly known as the blue water hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and ponds, where it thrives in moist or aquatic environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in some areas, often outcompeting native plants.</p>
<p>The flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive organs, facilitating self-pollination.</p>
