<p>Chrysanthemum alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum, commonly known as the Alpine woolly chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of dense, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with full sun exposure.</p>
