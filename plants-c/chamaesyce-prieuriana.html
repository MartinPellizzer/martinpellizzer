                    <h1>Chamaesyce prieuriana</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce prieuriana, commonly known as the rockcress or narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
