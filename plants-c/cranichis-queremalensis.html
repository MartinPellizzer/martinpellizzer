<p>Cranichis queremalensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
