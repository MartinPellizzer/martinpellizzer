                    <h1>Chamaerops excelsa</h1>
<p>Chamaerops excelsa, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a tall, solitary palm native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnately divided leaves that resemble a windmill, hence its common name. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue, fleshy fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and arid environments.</p>
<p>Chamaerops excelsa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardiness.</p>
