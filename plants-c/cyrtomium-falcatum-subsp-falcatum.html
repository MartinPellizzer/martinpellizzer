<p>Cyrtomium falcatum subsp.</p>
<p>falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features feather-like, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
