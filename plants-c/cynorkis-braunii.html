                    <h1>Cynorkis braunii</h1>
<p>Cynorkis braunii, commonly known as the Braun's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. Native to South Africa, this cycad thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it reproduces through wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cynorkis braunii is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
