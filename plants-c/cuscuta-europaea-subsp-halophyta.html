<p>Cuscuta europaea subsp.</p>
<p>halophyta, commonly known as the salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically attaches to a variety of hosts, including grasses and shrubs, using specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it a common inhabitant of coastal areas and salt marshes. Its small, yellow-orange flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat preferences, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
