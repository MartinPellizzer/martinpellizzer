                    <h1>Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. pleei</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. pleei, commonly known as cinnamon leaf or kaffir lime, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow, elongated leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval-shaped fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in compounds like limonene and cineol, contributing to its distinctive scent.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the commercial cinnamon species but is more valued for its aromatic foliage than its bark.</p>
