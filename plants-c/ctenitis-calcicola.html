                    <h1>Ctenitis calcicola</h1>
<p>Ctenitis calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with a creeping rhizome and small, shield-shaped fronds. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Ctenitis calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to limestone substrates.</p>
