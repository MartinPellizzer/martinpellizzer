<p>Coryphantha durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>cuencamensis, commonly known as the Cuencamense Paddle Cactus, is a rare and endemic cactus species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white or pale spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the apex of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
