                    <h1>Chamaefilix serra var. imrayana</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix serra var. imrayana, commonly known as the Sierra chamaefilix, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
