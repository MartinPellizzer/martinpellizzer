                            <h1>Calamagrostis Hirta</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis hirta, commonly known as hairy grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is prized for its ornamental value, featuring feathery plumes and a graceful, upright growth habit. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate water makes it a popular choice for rain gardens and naturalized landscapes. With its delicate appearance and ecological benefits, Calamagrostis hirta plays an important role in both garden design and wetland conservation.</p>
