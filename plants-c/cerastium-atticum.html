<p>Cerastium atticum, commonly known as the creeping winter cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, often reddish stems and trifoliate leaves. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Cerastium atticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
