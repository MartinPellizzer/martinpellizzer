<p>Carduus canus, commonly known as the hoary thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and spiny, purple-tan flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The hoary thistle is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and digestive issues.</p>
