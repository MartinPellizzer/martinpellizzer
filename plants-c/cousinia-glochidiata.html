                    <h1>Cousinia glochidiata</h1>
<p>Cousinia glochidiata, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its roots are extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia glochidiata is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
