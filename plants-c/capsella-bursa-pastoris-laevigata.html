                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris laevigata</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris laevigata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces spherical, three-lobed seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse, giving it its scientific name. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered with fine white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
