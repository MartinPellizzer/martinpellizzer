                    <h1>Cenchrus articularis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus articularis, commonly known as the jointed wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus articularis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization in degraded areas.</p>
