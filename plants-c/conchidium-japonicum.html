                    <h1>Conchidium japonicum</h1>
<p>Conchidium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese conch shell fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped fronds that resemble the coiled form of a conch shell, giving it its common name. The plant has a delicate, creeping growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
