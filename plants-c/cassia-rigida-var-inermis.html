<p>Cassia rigida var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with oval, smooth-edged leaflets that turn a striking coppery color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.</p>
