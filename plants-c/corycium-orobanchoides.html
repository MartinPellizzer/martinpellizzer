                    <h1>Corycium orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Corycium orobanchoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on specific host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, and it is often found growing epiphytically on trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, Corycium orobanchoides is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
