                    <h1>Coryphantha robustispina</h1>
<p>Coryphantha robustispina, commonly known as the robust spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, globular shape and short, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, and its spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Coryphantha robustispina is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens.</p>
