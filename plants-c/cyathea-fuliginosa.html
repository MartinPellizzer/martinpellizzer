<p>Cyathea fuliginosa, commonly known as the black tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dark, fibrous layer that resembles bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea fuliginosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
