<p>Cyathea dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the velamen. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea dicksonioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
