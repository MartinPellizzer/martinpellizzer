                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, ribbed stems. One of its most notable botanical features is its ability to produce live young, as it bears pups at the base of its stems rather than seeds. The plant has prominent areoles from which both flowers and spines emerge.</p>
<p>Its flowering occurs in the spring, producing yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
