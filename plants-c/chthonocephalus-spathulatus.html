                    <h1>Chthonocephalus spathulatus</h1>
<p>Chthonocephalus spathulatus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, elongated flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
