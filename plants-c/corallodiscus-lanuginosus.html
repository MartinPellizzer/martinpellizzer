<p>Corallodiscus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly disc coralline, is a species of red algae found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branching thallus that often appears in dense, crust-like formations on rocky substrates. The plant has a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called rhopalia. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reefs and tide pools.</p>
<p>Corallodiscus lanuginosus plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
