                    <h1>Cuscuta decora var. subnuda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta decora var. subnuda, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants in open, disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas readily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
