<p>Commelina erecta var. glochidea, commonly known as the glochidiate spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The variety is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs, which give it a rough texture and contribute to its common name.</p>
