                    <h1>Corryocactus erici-marae</h1>
<p>Corryocactus erici-marae, commonly known as the Maraean corryocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
