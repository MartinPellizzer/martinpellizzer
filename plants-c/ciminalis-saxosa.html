                    <h1>Ciminalis saxosa</h1>
<p>Ciminalis saxosa, commonly known as the rock lettuce, is a perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ciminalis saxosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>
