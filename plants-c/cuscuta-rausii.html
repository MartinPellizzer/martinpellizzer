                    <h1>Cuscuta rausii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rausii, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found growing on crops such as cotton and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
