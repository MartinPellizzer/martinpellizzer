                    <h1>Chromatotriccum deflexum</h1>
<p>Chromatotriccum deflexum, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
