<p>Cleisostoma rugosulum, commonly known as the warty lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive warty texture on the lip, which is a key identifying characteristic. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Cleisostoma rugosulum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat.</p>
