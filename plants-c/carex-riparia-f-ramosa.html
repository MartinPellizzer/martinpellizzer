                    <h1>Carex riparia f. ramosa</h1>
<p>Carex riparia f. ramosa, commonly known as the river sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist to aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of fluctuating water levels and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones.</p>
