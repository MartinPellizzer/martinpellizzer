                    <h1>Caularthron bicornutum</h1>
<p>Caularthron bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned algae, is a unicellular, marine alga belonging to the order Rhodophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two horn-like projections at the top of its cell, which aid in its identification. The organism is typically found in coastal waters and is often associated with rocky substrates. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and unique morphology make it an important subject in studies of marine phytoplankton.</p>
