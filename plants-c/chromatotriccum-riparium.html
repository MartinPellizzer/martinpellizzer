<p>Chromatotriccum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank moss, is a small, creeping moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and stream edges.</p>
<p>It has a dense, turfy growth habit and forms dark green to reddish-brown mats depending on environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Chromatotriccum riparium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and filtering water in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
