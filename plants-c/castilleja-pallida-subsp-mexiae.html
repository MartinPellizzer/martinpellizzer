<p>Castilleja pallida subsp.</p>
<p>mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-containing stems for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them.</p>
