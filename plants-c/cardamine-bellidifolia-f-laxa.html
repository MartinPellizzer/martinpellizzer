                    <h1>Cardamine bellidifolia f. laxa</h1>
<p>Cardamine bellidifolia f. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in cool, freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
