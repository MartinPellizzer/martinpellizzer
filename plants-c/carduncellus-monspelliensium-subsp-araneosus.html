<p>Carduncellus monspelliensium subsp.</p>
<p>araneosus, commonly known as the spider-thorn or spider thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its spines are a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser spines compared to other members of the genus.</p>
