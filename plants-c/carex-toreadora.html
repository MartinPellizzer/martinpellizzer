<p>Carex toreadora, commonly known as the Toreador sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its grass-like foliage forms dense clumps, and it produces small, three-sided spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Carex toreadora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
