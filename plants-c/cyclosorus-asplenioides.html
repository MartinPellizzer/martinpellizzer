<p>Cyclosorus asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus asplenioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
