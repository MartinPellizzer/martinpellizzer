                    <h1>Cephalantheropsis obcordata</h1>
<p>Cephalantheropsis obcordata, commonly known as the obcordate hooded orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a hood-like structure called the rostellum that encloses the pollinia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct scent that aids in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
