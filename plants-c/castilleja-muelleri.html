                    <h1>Castilleja muelleri</h1>
<p>Castilleja muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. Its small, tubular flowers are typically yellow or orange and are pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Castilleja muelleri thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
