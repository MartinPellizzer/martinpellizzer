                    <h1>Cavea tanguensis</h1>
<p>Cavea tanguensis, commonly known as the Tanguese cave plant, is a unique species native to the humid caves of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that anchor it to the rocky walls of its subterranean habitat. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers, which are rarely seen, are pale yellow and emit a faint scent to attract cave-dwelling insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized environment, Cavea tanguensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
