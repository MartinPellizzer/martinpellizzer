                    <h1>Cassytha americana</h1>
<p>Cassytha americana, commonly known as the American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in wetland areas and can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it unique among parasitic plants, as it relies entirely on its host for survival.</p>
