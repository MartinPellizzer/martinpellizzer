                    <h1>Critoniopsis steinbachii</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis steinbachii, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
