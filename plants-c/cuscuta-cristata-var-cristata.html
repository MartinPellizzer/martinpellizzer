                    <h1>Cuscuta cristata var. cristata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cristata var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous small, thread-like branches. The plant is often found in gardens and natural areas where it attaches to a variety of host species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
