<p>Carex cladostachya var. maxima, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, robust perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, showy spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, while the inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, one terminal and one lateral.</p>
