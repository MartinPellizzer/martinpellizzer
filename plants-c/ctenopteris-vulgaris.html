                    <h1>Ctenopteris vulgaris</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris vulgaris, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in coastal areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris vulgaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
