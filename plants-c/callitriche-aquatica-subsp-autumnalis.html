<p>Callitriche aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>autumnalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing tiny, floating fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to wetland habitats and plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
