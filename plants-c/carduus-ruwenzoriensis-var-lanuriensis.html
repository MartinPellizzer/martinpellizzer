                    <h1>Carduus ruwenzoriensis var. lanuriensis</h1>
<p>Carduus ruwenzoriensis var. lanuriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori thistle, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
