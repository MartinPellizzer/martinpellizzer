<p>Cardamine digitata var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>This species is often found in freshwater habitats, including streams, ponds, and wet meadows.</p>
