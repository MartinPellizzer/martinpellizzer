<p>Cerastium alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>babiogorense, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes.</p>
