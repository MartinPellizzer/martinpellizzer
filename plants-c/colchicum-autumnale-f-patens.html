                    <h1>Colchicum autumnale f. patens</h1>
<p>Colchicum autumnale f. patens, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a bulb-like corm, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emerge after the flowers, often in a different season.</p>
<p>This variant of Colchicum autumnale is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
