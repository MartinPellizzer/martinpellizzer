                    <h1>Caltha palustris var. araneosa</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris var. araneosa, commonly known as the spiderwort marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in damp environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, stream sides, and other moist, shaded areas.</p>
