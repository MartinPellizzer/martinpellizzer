<p>Cytisophyllum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf cytisophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are attached directly to the stem, lacking stalks. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
