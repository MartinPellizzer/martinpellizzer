                    <h1>Celastrus tatarinowii</h1>
<p>Celastrus tatarinowii, commonly known as the Tatarian bindweed, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America.</p>
