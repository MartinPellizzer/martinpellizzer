                    <h1>Corrigiola deltoidea</h1>
<p>Corrigiola deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Corrigiola deltoidea is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds.</p>
