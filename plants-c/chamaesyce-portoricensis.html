<p>Chamaesyce portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican sand mat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open habitats. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
