                    <h1>Cypripedium bulbosum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cypripedium bulbosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a velvety, pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it forms a dense underground bulb-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
