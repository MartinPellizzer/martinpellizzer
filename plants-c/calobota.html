<p>Calobota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds.
