<p>Cyclopogon eugenii, commonly known as the pink cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a striking pinkish hue. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Cyclopogon eugenii thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
