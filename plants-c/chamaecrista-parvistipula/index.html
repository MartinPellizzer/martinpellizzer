                            <h1>Chamaecrista Parvistipula</h1>
<p>Parvistipula cassia, scientifically known as Chamaecrista parvistipula, is a rare and striking member of the legume family native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its small size and limited distribution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in shaded woodland areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
