<p>Carex squamata, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, silver-white leaves that give it its common name.

It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
