                    <h1>Cephalophyllum niveum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum niveum, commonly known as the white-headed cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs that give it its common name and help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant contrast to its gray-green stems. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
