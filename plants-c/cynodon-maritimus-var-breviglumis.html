                    <h1>Cynodon maritimus var. breviglumis</h1>
<p>Cynodon maritimus var. breviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This variety thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
