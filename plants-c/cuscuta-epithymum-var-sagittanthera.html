                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. sagittanthera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. sagittanthera, commonly known as the arrowhead dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecological interactions and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
