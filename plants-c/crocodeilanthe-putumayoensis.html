                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe putumayoensis</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe putumayoensis, commonly known as the Putumayo staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a staghorn. The plant typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, helping it anchor to its host.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the Putumayo region of Colombia.</p>
