                    <h1>Cassytha pubescens var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cassytha pubescens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and leaves.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. It is native to Australia and thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
