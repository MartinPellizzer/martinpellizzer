<p>Chrysanthemum alpinum f. minimum, commonly known as the alpine dwarf chrysanthemum, is a compact, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few inches in height, and its dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>
