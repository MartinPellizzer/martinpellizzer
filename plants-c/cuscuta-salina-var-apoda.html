                    <h1>Cuscuta salina var. apoda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina var. apoda, commonly known as saltweed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal areas and thrives in saline environments, often found in dunes or salt marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of its host plants in coastal ecosystems.</p>
