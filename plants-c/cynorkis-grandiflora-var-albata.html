                    <h1>Cynorkis grandiflora var. albata</h1>
<p>Cynorkis grandiflora var. albata, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
