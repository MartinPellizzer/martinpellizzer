                    <h1>Cinchona palton</h1>
<p>Cinchona palton, commonly known as the Peruvian bark, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is most notable for containing quinine, a compound historically used to treat malaria.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinchona palton is now considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
