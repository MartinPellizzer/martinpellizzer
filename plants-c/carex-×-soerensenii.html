                    <h1>Carex × soerensenii</h1>
<p>Carex × soerensenii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex appropria and Carex hystrix, making it a naturally occurring botanical curiosity. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. Its leaves are usually dark green and narrow, with a distinctive texture that sets it apart from other sedges.</p>
<p>While it does not produce seeds, it can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its persistence in wetland habitats.</p>
