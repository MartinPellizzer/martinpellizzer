<p>Chaetogastra goudotii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Chaetogastra goudotii is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, but caution is advised due to its potentially harmful sap.</p>
