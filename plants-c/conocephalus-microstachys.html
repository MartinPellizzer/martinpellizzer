                    <h1>Conocephalus microstachys</h1>
<p>Conocephalus microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked conocephalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family.</p>
<p>It is a small annual grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations.</p>
