                    <h1>Cyrtorchis droogmansiana</h1>
<p>Cyrtorchis droogmansiana, commonly known as the Droogmans' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
