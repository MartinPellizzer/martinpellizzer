<p>Cyclosorus inclusus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus inclusus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
