<p>Cyperus megapotamicus var. nematodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its tolerance to fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stabilizing effect on wetland soils.</p>
