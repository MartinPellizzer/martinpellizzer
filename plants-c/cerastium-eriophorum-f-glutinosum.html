<p>Cerastium eriophorum f. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, sticky hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered in a glandular, sticky coating, which gives the plant its common name. The flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced glandular secretions compared to the typical form of Cerastium eriophorum.</p>
