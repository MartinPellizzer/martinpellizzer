                    <h1>Carex densa</h1>
<p>Carex densa, commonly known as dense sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex densa is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
