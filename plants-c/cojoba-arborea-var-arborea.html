                    <h1>Cojoba arborea var. arborea</h1>
<p>Cojoba arborea var. arborea, commonly known as the white cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical regions as a shade tree.</p>
