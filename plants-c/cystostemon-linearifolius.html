                    <h1>Cystostemon linearifolius</h1>
<p>Cystostemon linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host relationships and ecological interactions.</p>
