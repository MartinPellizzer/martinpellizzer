                    <h1>Chelyocarpus</h1>
<p>Chelyocarpus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in brackish water environments. The plants are characterized by their aerial roots, which help in anchoring them in soft, waterlogged soils. Chelyocarpus species produce fruits that are often edible, with a fleshy, sweet pulp encasing a hard, woody seed.</p>
<p>These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
