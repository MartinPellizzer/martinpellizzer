                    <h1>Colchicum feinbruniae</h1>
<p>Colchicum feinbruniae, commonly known as the Feinbrun's colchicum, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
