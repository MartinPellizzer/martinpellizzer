                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. planiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. planiflora, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and soybean. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
