                    <h1>Centrosema rigidulum</h1>
<p>Centrosema rigidulum, commonly known as rigidstem cowpea, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility.</p>
