<p>Carpacoce scabra subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rough carpacoce, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine or rocky habitats. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often on steep slopes or rocky outcrops. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
