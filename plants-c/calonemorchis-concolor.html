<p>Calonemorchis concolor, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, often translucent leaves and its single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered threatened in its native range.</p>
