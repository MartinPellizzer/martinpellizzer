<p>Carex atrata var. parviflora, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually brown or black in color, contributing to its common name.</p>
