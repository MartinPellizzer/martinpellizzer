<p>Cyclosorus × insularis, commonly known as the island water clover, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its stems can spread horizontally to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus × insularis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
