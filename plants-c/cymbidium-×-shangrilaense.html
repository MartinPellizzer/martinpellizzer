<p>Cymbidium × shangrilaense, commonly known as the Shangrila orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from the Yunnan province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring.

Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Cymbidium × shangrilaense is also valued for its resilience and adaptability to different growing conditions.</p>
