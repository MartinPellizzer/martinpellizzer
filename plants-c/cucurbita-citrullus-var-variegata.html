                    <h1>Cucurbita citrullus var. variegata</h1>
<p>Cucurbita citrullus var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated watermelon, is a variant of the watermelon species characterized by its distinctive mottled or striped foliage and fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is a vigorous vine that thrives in warm climates, producing large, sweet fruits with a pale green rind and red or yellow flesh. Its leaves are typically broad and have a light green to variegated pattern, which sets it apart from standard watermelon varieties. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a common trait in cucurbits.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily grown for its ornamental value and unique appearance, though it can also yield edible fruits.</p>
