                    <h1>Carex merxmuelleri</h1>
<p>Carex merxmuelleri, commonly known as the Merxmüller’s sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spiky flower clusters in late spring to early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Carex merxmuelleri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife.</p>
