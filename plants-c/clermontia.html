                    <h1>Clermontia</h1>
<p>Clermontia, commonly known as the mountain ginger, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. Clermontia species typically grow in forested areas, often at high elevations, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and the plants are often found in clusters on rocky slopes or in streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many Clermontia species are now endangered or critically endangered.</p>
