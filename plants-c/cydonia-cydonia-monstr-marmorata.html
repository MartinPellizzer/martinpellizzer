<p>Cydonia cydonia monstr.</p>
<p>marmorata, commonly known as the marble peach, is a rare and striking variant of the common quince. This plant is characterized by its unique, marbled skin patterns that resemble the appearance of marble, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces fragrant, yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit, which matures in late summer, is typically pear-shaped and has a tough, woody texture.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers.</p>
