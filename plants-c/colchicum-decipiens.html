<p>Colchicum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking purple or white flowers in the autumn, which are often mistaken for true crocuses but bloom later in the season. The plant has a distinctive, spathaceous leaf that resembles a flower, leading to its common name. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Colchicum decipiens thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
