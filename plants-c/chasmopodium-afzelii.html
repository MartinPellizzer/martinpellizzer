<p>Chasmopodium afzelii, commonly known as the mountain grass or Afghan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve water in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Chasmopodium afzelii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
