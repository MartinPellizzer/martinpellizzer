<p>Caucalis gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to shaded woodland areas. It features slender, creeping stems with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect light in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along the edges of shaded gardens.</p>
