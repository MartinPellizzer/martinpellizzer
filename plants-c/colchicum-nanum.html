                    <h1>Colchicum nanum</h1>
<p>Colchicum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a small perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking violet-blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically above a rosette of waxy, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Its bulbs contain toxic compounds, including colchicine, which has been used in medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
