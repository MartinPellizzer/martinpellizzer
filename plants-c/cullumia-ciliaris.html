The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Cullumia ciliaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
