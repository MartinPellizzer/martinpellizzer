                    <h1>Cathartolinum tenellum</h1>
<p>Cathartolinum tenellum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces primarily through the release of motile zoospores.</p>
<p>Cathartolinum tenellum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
