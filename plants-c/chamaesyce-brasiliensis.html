                    <h1>Chamaesyce brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
