                    <h1>Crepis fontiana</h1>
<p>Crepis fontiana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Crepis fontiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
