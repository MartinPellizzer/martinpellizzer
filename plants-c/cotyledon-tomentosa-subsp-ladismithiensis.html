<p>Cotyledon tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>ladismithiensis, commonly known as the Ladismith cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating.</p>
<p>The leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
