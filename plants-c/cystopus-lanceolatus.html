                    <h1>Cystopus lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Cystopus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it has specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft, waterlogged soil, and its leaves are thin and strap-like, facilitating efficient gas exchange.</p>
<p>Cystopus lanceolatus plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic environments.</p>
