<p>Chionogentias pleurogynoides subsp.</p>
<p>milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems.</p>
<p>The plant has small, elongated leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
