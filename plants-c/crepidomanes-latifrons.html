<p>Crepidomanes latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are usually found on the underside of the thallus.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes latifrons plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
