                    <h1>Carex umbellata var. globosa</h1>
<p>Carex umbellata var. globosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of grass-like leaves, which form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in moist habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet or saturated soil conditions.</p>
