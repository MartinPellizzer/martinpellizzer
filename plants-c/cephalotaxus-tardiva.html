                    <h1>Cephalotaxus tardiva</h1>
<p>Cephalotaxus tardiva, commonly known as the late-flowering Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
