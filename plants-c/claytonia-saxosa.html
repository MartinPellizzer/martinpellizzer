                    <h1>Claytonia saxosa</h1>
<p>Claytonia saxosa, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Claytonia saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
