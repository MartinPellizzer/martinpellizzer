                    <h1>Chamaesyce buxifolia</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, giving them a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in natural habitats if not managed carefully.</p>
