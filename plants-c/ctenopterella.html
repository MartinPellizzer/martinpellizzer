                    <h1>Ctenopterella</h1>
<p>Ctenopterella, commonly known as the feather fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns belonging to the family Hymenophylliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, feathery fronds that give them their common name. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Ctenopterella species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in humid, cool climates.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually clustered in small, rounded groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
