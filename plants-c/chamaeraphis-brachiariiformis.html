                <h1>Chamaeraphis brachiariiformis</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis brachiariiformis, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, triangular seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
