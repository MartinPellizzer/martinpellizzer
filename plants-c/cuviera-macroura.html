                    <h1>Cuviera macroura</h1>
<p>Cuviera macroura, commonly known as the long-stemmed cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cuviera macroura is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
