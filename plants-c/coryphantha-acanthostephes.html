                    <h1>Coryphantha acanthostephes</h1>
<p>Coryphantha acanthostephes, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, backward-pointing spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny body. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
