                    <h1>Cyrtanthus epiphyticus</h1>
<p>Cyrtanthus epiphyticus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to South Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions with minimal water.</p>
