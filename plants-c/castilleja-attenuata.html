                    <h1>Castilleja attenuata</h1>
<p>Castilleja attenuata, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja attenuata blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
