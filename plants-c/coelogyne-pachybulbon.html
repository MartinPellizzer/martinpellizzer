                    <h1>Coelogyne pachybulbon</h1>
<p>Coelogyne pachybulbon, commonly known as the fat bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a rosette near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Coelogyne pachybulbon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
