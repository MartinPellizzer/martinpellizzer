                <h1>Condaliopsis lycioides</h1>
<p>Condaliopsis lycioides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange and yellow. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry environments, and its leaves are narrow and hairy to reduce water loss. It blooms during the early morning, hence its common name, and relies on pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
