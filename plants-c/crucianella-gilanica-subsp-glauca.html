<p>Crucianella gilanica subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as the glaucous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its bluish-gray appearance, which is due to a waxy coating on its surfaces.</p>
