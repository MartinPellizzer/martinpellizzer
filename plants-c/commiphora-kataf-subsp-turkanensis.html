<p>Commiphora kataf subsp.</p>
<p>turkanensis, commonly known as the Turkanensis myrrh tree, is a species native to parts of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Somalia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that produces a resinous sap, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish.</p>
<p>The resin exuded from its bark and stems is similar to myrrh and has been historically valued for its medicinal and incense properties.</p>
