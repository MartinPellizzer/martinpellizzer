                    <h1>Cylindropuntia tunicata var. chilensis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia tunicata var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean cholla, is a spine-tipped cactus native to central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates.</p>
