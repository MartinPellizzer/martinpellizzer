                    <h1>Castilleja pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Castilleja pulcherrima, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja pulcherrima plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
