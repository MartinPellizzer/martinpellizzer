                    <h1>Caltha sagittata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Caltha sagittata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped, bright green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ornamental value.</p>
