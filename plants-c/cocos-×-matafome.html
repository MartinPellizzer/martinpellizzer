                    <h1>Cocos × matafome</h1>
<p>Cocos × matafome, commonly known as the hybrid coconut palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Cocos nucifera* (tall coconut) and *Cocos nana* (dwarf coconut).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, typically having a shorter stature and a more compact trunk compared to the tall coconut. The leaves are broad and feather-like, similar to those of the tall coconut, while the fruit is usually smaller and more robust. This hybrid is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various coastal and tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is often aimed at producing coconuts with improved yield and resistance to environmental stressors.</p>
