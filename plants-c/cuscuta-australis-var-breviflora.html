                    <h1>Cuscuta australis var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta australis var. breviflora, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to Australia, where it often infests native vegetation. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that wraps around its host, forming a dense network. It is an annual species that thrives in a variety of habitats, including gardens and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
