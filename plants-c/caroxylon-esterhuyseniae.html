                    <h1>Caroxylon esterhuyseniae</h1>
<p>Caroxylon esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia date palm, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and its role as a relic of past climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
