<p>Campyloneurum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often broad leaves that can grow up to several centimeters in length. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive, arching growth habit that allows the plant to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It prefers to grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
