<p>Conophytum piriforme, commonly known as the "pear-shaped stone plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, pear-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Conophytum piriforme is well-suited for dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
