<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of Carex sylvatica. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, wet meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and naturalistic plantings.</p>
