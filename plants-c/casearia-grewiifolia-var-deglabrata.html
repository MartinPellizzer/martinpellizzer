                    <h1>Casearia grewiifolia var. deglabrata</h1>
<p>Casearia grewiifolia var. deglabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often pubescent leaves that lack the typical glandular hairs found in other casearia species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
