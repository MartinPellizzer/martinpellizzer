<p>Crocus alatavicus var. albus, commonly known as the white alatavian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, often fragrant scent. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to cold, arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
