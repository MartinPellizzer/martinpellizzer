                    <h1>Conyza variegata</h1>
<p>Conyza variegata, commonly known as the variable weed or the dandelion-like weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender stems and small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of dandelions. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Conyza variegata is considered a problematic weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
