                    <h1>Cherleria juniperina</h1>
<p>Cherleria juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-like Cherleria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of juniper, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cherleria juniperina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
