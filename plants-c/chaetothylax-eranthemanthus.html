                    <h1>Chaetothylax eranthemanthus</h1>
<p>Chaetothylax eranthemanthus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
