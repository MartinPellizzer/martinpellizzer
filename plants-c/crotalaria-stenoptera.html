<p>Crotalaria stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>
