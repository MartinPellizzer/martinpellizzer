                    <h1>Cypripedium niveum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium niveum, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a truss of hair. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium niveum is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
