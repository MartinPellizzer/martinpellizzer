                    <h1>Coppensia mandonii</h1>
<p>Coppensia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it grows as an epiphyte on the trunks of rainforest trees. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and filtered sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia mandonii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
