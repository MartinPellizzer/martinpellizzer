                    <h1>Cuscuta odorata var. holwayana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta odorata var. holwayana, commonly known as the sweetleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender, branching stems. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on various host plants such as beans and other legumes. Its seeds are small and can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods, allowing for long-term survival.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions.</p>
