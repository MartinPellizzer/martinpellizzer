<p>Carex stupenda var. robusta, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a striking ornamental plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and broad, grass-like leaves that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces dense clusters of pale to dark green, spike-like inflorescences, which add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist to wet soils and partial to full sun, making it ideal for wetland gardens or bog landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and architectural form, it is a popular choice for naturalizing in water features and rain gardens.</p>
