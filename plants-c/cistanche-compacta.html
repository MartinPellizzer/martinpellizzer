<p>Cistanche compacta, commonly known as the desert tuber or Indian rhubarb, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Hedera. Its structure consists of a fleshy, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers and is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and habitat, it is often found in sandy soils and rocky areas.</p>
