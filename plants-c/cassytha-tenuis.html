                    <h1>Cassytha tenuis</h1>
<p>Cassytha tenuis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants, primarily members of the legume family, using its haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread along the surface of its host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
