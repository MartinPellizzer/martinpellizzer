                    <h1>Ctenitis coriacea</h1>
<p>Ctenitis coriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, rugged appearance.</p>
