<p>Catapodium rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>rigidum, commonly known as rigid false grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
