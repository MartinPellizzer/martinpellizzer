                    <h1>Candollea huegelii</h1>
<p>Candollea huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's candollea, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
