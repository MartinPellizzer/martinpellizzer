                    <h1>Clidemia francavillana</h1>
<p>Clidemia francavillana, commonly known as the Hawaiian snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native forests. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
