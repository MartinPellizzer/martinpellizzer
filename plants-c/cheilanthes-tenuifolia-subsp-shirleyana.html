<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>shirleyana, commonly known as Shirley's rockcap, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
