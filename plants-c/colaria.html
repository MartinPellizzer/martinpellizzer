                    <h1>Colaria</h1>
<p>Colaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. They have distinctive blue or purple flower heads that resemble holly berries, hence their common name. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Colaria species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
