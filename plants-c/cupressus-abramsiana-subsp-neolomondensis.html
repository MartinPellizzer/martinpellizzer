<p>Cupressus abramsiana subsp.</p>
<p>neolomondensis, commonly known as the Neolomond cedar, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the southwestern United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its scale-like leaves and distinctive, rounded cones.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Its botanical features include a straight trunk with a conical crown, and it produces aromatic, woody foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
