                            <h1>Curculigo Veratrifolia</h1>
<p>Curculigo, scientifically known as Curculigo veratrifolia, is a unique and lesser-known flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. This plant belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, despite its non-orchid appearance. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and creeping rhizomes that help it spread across moist environments. Curculigo veratrifolia is often found in shaded, wet areas such as forests and marshes, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it has become a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
