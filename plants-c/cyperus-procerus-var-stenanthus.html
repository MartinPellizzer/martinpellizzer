                    <h1>Cyperus procerus var. stenanthus</h1>
<p>Cyperus procerus var. stenanthus, commonly known as narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Cyperus procerus, making it easily identifiable in its native environment.</p>
