                    <h1>Croton laciniatistylus</h1>
<p>Croton laciniatistylus, commonly known as the fringed croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
