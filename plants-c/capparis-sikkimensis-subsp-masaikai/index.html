                            <h1>Capparis Sikkimensis Subsp. Masaikai</h1>
<p>Sikkim caper, scientifically known as Capparis sikkimensis subsp. masaikai, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the eastern Himalayas. This shrub is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance within its native habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing in forested regions of Sikkim and adjacent areas. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
