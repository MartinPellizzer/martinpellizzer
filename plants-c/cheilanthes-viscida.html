                    <h1>Cheilanthes viscida</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viscida, commonly known as the sticky brake fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky substance. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes viscida is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range.</p>
