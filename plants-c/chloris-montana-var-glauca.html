                    <h1>Chloris montana var. glauca</h1>
<p>Chloris montana var. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
