                    <h1>Cypripedium × pavoninum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × pavoninum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive pink or red pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or forest soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
