                    <h1>Claytonia australasica var. alpina</h1>
<p>Claytonia australasica var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine claytonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
