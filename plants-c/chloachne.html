                    <h1>Chloachne</h1>
<p>Chloachne, commonly known as the silver grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plants typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Chloachne species are perennial and can form dense clumps, making them useful for erosion control in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Their small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in panicles and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
