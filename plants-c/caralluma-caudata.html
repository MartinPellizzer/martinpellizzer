                    <h1>Caralluma caudata</h1>
<p>Caralluma caudata, commonly known as the Candelabra Fig or Desert Candelabra, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that often resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Caralluma caudata is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
