                    <h1>Cervaria rigida</h1>
<p>Cervaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid cervaria, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant features a robust, upright rhizome with numerous fronds that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The rigid structure of its fronds and rhizome contributes to its common name and helps it thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
