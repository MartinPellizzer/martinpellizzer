                    <h1>Cassuvium coriaceum</h1>
<p>Cassuvium coriaceum, commonly known as the tough-skinned orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that provide protection against intense sunlight and cold temperatures. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom during the short summer season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Cassuvium coriaceum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
