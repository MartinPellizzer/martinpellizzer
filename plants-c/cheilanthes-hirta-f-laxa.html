<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
