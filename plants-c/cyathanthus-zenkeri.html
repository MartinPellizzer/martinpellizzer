                    <h1>Cyathanthus zenkeri</h1>
<p>Cyathanthus zenkeri, commonly known as the Zanzibar lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Cyathanthus zenkeri is typically found in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and high salinity.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires specific care to thrive outside its native environment.</p>
