                            <h1>Claytonia Denticulata</h1>
<p>Dentate claytonia, scientifically known as Claytonia denticulata, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This low-growing species is characterized by its toothed leaves and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors or rocky streambanks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dentate claytonia is considered endangered in many areas. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
