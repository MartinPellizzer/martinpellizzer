                    <h1>Chaixia myconi</h1>
<p>Chaixia myconi, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows on decaying wood, especially in moist, temperate forest environments. The fungus has a smooth, waxy surface and a pale yellow to orange coloration that becomes more pronounced as it matures. Its spores are released from the cup-like structure and are dispersed by wind, aiding in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Chaixia myconi is often found in association with hardwood trees and is a common sight in fungal surveys of forest floors.</p>
