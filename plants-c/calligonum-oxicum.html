<p>Calligonum oxicum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enhancing its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Calligonum oxicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate extreme environmental conditions.</p>
