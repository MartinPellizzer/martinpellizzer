                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis f. paludosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis f. paludosa, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a fern-like plant native to moist and wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas in its preferred wet environment.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in many regions.</p>
