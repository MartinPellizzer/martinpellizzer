<p>Cyclosorus martinii, commonly known as the Martin's waterwheel, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that radiate from a central stem, creating a distinctive wheel-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its fronds are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus martinii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
