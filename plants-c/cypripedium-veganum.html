                    <h1>Cypripedium veganum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium veganum, commonly known as the vegan orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a single, downward-facing lip and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi to support its nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale pink or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium veganum is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
