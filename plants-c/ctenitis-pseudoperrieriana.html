                    <h1>Ctenitis pseudoperrieriana</h1>
<p>Ctenitis pseudoperrieriana, commonly known as the Pseudoperrier's sea holly, is a rare and unique species of marine plant found in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand tidal conditions. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology, with a root system that anchors it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are typically found in the upper parts of the plant, facilitating spore dispersal in the intertidal zone.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
