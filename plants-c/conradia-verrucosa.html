                    <h1>Conradia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Conradia verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Conradia verrucosa is a carnivorous plant, adapting to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats through its unique trapping mechanism.</p>
