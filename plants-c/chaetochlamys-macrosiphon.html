<p>Chaetochlamys macrosiphon, commonly known as the large-siphon lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive thallus with a leathery, lobed structure and a dense network of fungal hyphae that support its growth. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy through chlorophyll. Its morphology includes prominent, elongated lobes and a dark, often brownish upper surface.</p>
<p>This lichen is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in shaded, moist environments.</p>
