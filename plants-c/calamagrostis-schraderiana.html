                    <h1>Calamagrostis schraderiana</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis schraderiana, commonly known as Schrader's reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its flowering period makes it a valuable species for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis schraderiana is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
