<p>Carex rhizina subsp.</p>
<p>reventa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive three-ranked leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
