<p>Cassytha paniculata var. phaeolaris, commonly known as the dark cassytha, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually elliptical or ovate in shape.</p>
<p>The dark cassytha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
