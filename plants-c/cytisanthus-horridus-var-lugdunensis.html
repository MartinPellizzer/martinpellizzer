                    <h1>Cytisanthus horridus var. lugdunensis</h1>
<p>Cytisanthus horridus var. lugdunensis, commonly known as the Lugdunensis Cytisanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
