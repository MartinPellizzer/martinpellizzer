                    <h1>Cousinia machaerophora</h1>
<p>Cousinia machaerophora, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia machaerophora is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in regions with low precipitation.</p>
