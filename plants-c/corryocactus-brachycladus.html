                    <h1>Corryocactus brachycladus</h1>
<p>Corryocactus brachycladus, commonly known as the narrow-armed cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters of small, spiny segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Corryocactus brachycladus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
