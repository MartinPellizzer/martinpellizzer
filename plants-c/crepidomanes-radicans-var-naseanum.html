                    <h1>Crepidomanes radicans var. naseanum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes radicans var. naseanum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically followed by kidney-shaped, spurred fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The species is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils.</p>
