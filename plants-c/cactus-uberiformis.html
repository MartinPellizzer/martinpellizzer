                    <h1>Cactus uberiformis</h1>
<p>Cactus uberiformis, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The cactus also has a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps to insulate it and protect it from intense sunlight.</p>
