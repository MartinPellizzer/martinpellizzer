<p>Cyclosorus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran cyclosorus, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
