                    <h1>Cousinia alexeenkoana var. alexeenkoana</h1>
<p>Cousinia alexeenkoana var. alexeenkoana, commonly known as the Alexandrin's cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and unique foliage texture.</p>
