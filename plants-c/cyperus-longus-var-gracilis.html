                    <h1>Cyperus longus var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Cyperus longus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in subtropical and tropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slender, more delicate stems compared to the typical Cyperus longus.</p>
