                    <h1>Claytonia compacta</h1>
<p>Claytonia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and early blooming make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
