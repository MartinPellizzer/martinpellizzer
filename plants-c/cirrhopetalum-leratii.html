<p>Cirrhopetalum leratii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
