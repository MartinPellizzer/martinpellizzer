                    <h1>Caralluma arachnoidea var. arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Caralluma arachnoidea var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
