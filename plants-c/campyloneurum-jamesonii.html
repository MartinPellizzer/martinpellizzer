                    <h1>Campyloneurum jamesonii</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
