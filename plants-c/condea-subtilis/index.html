                            <h1>Condea Subtilis</h1>
<p>Sweet melissa, scientifically known as Condea subtilis, is a rare and delicate herb native to the damp woodlands of Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is celebrated for its aromatic leaves, which emit a soothing, mint-like scent, making it a popular choice in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Despite its small size, Sweet melissa plays a significant role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance, with finely toothed leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers, adds to its charm and ecological value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is now considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its future.</p>
