<p>Cyclosorus ciliensis, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble small, delicate clover leaves. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus ciliensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
