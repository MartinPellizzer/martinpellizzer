                    <h1>Chloris halophila var. humilis</h1>
<p>Chloris halophila var. humilis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system helps it access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats.</p>
