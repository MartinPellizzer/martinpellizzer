                <h1>Choristea carnosa</h1>
<p>Choristea carnosa, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils.</p>
<p>Choristea carnosa is adapted to seasonal flooding and is often found in marshy areas along rivers and lakeshores.</p>
