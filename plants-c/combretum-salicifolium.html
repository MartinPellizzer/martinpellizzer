                    <h1>Combretum salicifolium</h1>
<p>Combretum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
