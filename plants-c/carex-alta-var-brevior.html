<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in dense, tussock-like clumps. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets.</p>
