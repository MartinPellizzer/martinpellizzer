                    <h1>Claytonia latifolia</h1>
<p>Claytonia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Claytonia latifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
