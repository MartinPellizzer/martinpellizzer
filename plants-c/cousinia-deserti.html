                    <h1>Cousinia deserti</h1>
<p>Cousinia deserti, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-like structure that helps it survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which reduces water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cousinia deserti plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem.</p>
