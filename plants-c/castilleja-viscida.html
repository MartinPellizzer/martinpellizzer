                    <h1>Castilleja viscida</h1>
<p>Castilleja viscida, commonly known as the sticky castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Castilleja viscida is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
