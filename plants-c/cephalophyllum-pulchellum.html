<p>Cephalophyllum pulchellum, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, colorful, and showy flowers that resemble small lanterns, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a short, thick, cylindrical stem with sparse, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically borne at the top of the stem, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum pulchellum is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
