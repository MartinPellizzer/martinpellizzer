                    <h1>Conchocarpus odoratissimus</h1>
<p>Conchocarpus odoratissimus, commonly known as the stinkwood or African ironwood, is a member of the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that emits a strong, unpleasant odor when cut. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it is valued for construction and furniture-making, though its strong scent limits its use in some applications.</p>
