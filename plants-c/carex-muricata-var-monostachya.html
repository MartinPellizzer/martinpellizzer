                    <h1>Carex muricata var. monostachya</h1>
<p>Carex muricata var. monostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
