<p>Calluna vulgaris subf.</p>
<p>elata, commonly known as the tall heather, is a subshrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodland or heathland environments. It produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its taller stature compared to the typical form of Calluna vulgaris.</p>
