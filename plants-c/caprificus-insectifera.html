<p>Caprificus insectifera, commonly known as the insect-bearing caprifig, is a species of fig tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique flowering structure, which consists of a large, green, fig-like syconium containing both male and female flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by a specific species of wasp, making it an important example of mutualistic pollination. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Caprificus insectifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
