                    <h1>Cicuta resinifera</h1>
<p>Cicuta resinifera, commonly known as the resinous water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herb that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has a tall, hollow stem with broad, pinnately lobed leaves and small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. It produces a milky, toxic sap that contains potent neurotoxins, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in its native range.</p>
