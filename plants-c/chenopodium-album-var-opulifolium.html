                    <h1>Chenopodium album var. opulifolium</h1>
<p>Chenopodium album var. opulifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Chenopodium album by its more deeply lobed leaves and overall more robust growth habit.</p>
