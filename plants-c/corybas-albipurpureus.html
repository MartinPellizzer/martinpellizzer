<p>Corybas albipurpureus, commonly known as the purple-white hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the genus Corybas. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white and purple-pink coloration, which is often covered in a velvety texture. It is native to the wet tropical forests of New Guinea and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
