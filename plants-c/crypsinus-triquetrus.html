                    <h1>Crypsinus triquetrus</h1>
<p>Crypsinus triquetrus, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has a slender, branching stem with tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water and relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and predatory behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
