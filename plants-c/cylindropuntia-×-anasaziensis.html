                    <h1>Cylindropuntia × anasaziensis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia × anasaziensis, commonly known as the Anasazi cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with small, rounded tubercles and is characterized by its lack of prominent spines, making it unique among cholla species. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>The Anasazi cholla is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical significance to indigenous peoples.</p>
