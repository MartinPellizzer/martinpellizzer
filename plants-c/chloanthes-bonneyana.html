                    <h1>Chloanthes bonneyana</h1>
<p>Chloanthes bonneyana, commonly known as the Bonney's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its delicate, slender stems and leaves are adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chloanthes bonneyana is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
