                    <h1>Carlina frigida</h1>
<p>Carlina frigida, commonly known as the alpine carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to low temperatures and high altitudes.</p>
<p>Carlina frigida is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
