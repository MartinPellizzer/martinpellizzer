                    <h1>Caelestina pohlii</h1>
<p>Caelestina pohlii, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid blue or purple flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention in its cold, arid environment. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize rocky soils.</p>
<p>Caelestina pohlii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
