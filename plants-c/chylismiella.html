                    <h1>Chylismiella</h1>
<p>Chylismiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments and its role in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Chylismiella is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
