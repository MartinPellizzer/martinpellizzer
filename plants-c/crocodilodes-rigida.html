                    <h1>Crocodilodes rigida</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes rigida, commonly known as the rigid crocodile plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are often ridged or grooved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from its tough, rigid foliage and its resemblance to a crocodile's skin.</p>
