                            <h1>Cathartocarpus Moschatus</h1>
<p>Mosquito grass, scientifically known as Cathartocarpus moschatus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern North America. It thrives in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies that help prevent soil erosion. Despite its name, this plant is not harmful to humans and is actually valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Its tiny, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers make it a unique addition to native plant gardens. With its ability to tolerate shade and wet conditions, mosquito grass is a hardy and resilient species that supports local wildlife and enhances biodiversity.</p>
