                    <h1>Cinchona delessertiana</h1>
<p>Cinchona delessertiana, commonly known as the Delessert's quinine tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking red or orange flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, though it is not as widely used for pharmaceutical purposes as other cinchona species. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 10 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
