                    <h1>Carduus desertorum</h1>
<p>Carduus desertorum, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
