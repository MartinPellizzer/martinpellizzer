                    <h1>Cattleya × victoria-regina</h1>
<p>Cattleya × victoria-regina, commonly known as the Victoria Regina orchid, is a hybrid orchid species renowned for its large, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae, resulting in a plant with vibrant, often ruffled petals and a prominent lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple, and it is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance.</p>
<p>This orchid requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to maintain optimal growth and flowering.</p>
