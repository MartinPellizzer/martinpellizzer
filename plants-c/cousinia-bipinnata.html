                    <h1>Cousinia bipinnata</h1>
<p>Cousinia bipinnata, commonly known as the two-feathered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia bipinnata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
