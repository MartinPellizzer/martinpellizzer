<p>Chresta exsucca, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small and pointed, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Chresta exsucca is well adapted to hot, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
