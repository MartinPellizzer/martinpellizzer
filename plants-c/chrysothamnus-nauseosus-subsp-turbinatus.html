<p>Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp.</p>
<p>turbinatus, commonly known as the Turbinated Goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
