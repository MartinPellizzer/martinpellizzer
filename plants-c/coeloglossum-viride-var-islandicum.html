<p>Coeloglossum viride var. islandicum, commonly known as the Island Green Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Iceland.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in areas with high humidity. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to the harsh, cold climate of Iceland, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
