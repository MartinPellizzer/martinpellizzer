                    <h1>Campsis radicans f. praecox</h1>
<p>Campsis radicans f. praecox, commonly known as the early flowering trumpetvine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red tubular flowers that bloom earlier than the typical Campsis radicans, often in late spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb or spread make it a versatile but sometimes invasive plant in certain regions.</p>
