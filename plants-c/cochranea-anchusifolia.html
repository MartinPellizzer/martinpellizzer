                    <h1>Cochranea anchusifolia</h1>
<p>Cochranea anchusifolia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It blooms during the spring and early summer, often after rainfall, and relies on pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cochranea anchusifolia is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
