<p>Cyclosorus orthocaulis, commonly known as the upright water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged, floating, and emergent growth forms, with small, heart-shaped leaves that often form a rosette. The plant typically thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus orthocaulis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
