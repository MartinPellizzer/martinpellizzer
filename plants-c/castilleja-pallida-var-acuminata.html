                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. acuminata, commonly known as the pale castilleja with acute leaves, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its small, leafless stems are often mistaken for dead twigs, making it a cryptic species in its native environment.</p>
