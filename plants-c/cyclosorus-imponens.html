<p>Cyclosorus imponens, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
