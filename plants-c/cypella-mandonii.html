                    <h1>Cypella mandonii</h1>
<p>Cypella mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's cypella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for specialized cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella mandonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
