                    <h1>Cecropia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Cecropia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments within rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
