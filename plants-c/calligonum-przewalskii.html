                    <h1>Calligonum przewalskii</h1>
<p>Calligonum przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's spiny tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
