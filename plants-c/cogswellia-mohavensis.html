<p>Cogswellia mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with dense, spiny stems that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cogswellia mohavensis is adapted to desert conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
