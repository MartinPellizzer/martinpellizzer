                    <h1>Cupressus bakeri</h1>
<p>Cupressus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and slender, columnar growth habit. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
