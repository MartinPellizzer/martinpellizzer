                    <h1>Corynostylis</h1>
<p>Corynostylis, commonly known as the grass-tailed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, grass-like foliage and small, intricate flowers. Corynostylis species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinct, narrow spur that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or threatened.</p>
