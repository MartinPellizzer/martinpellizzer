<p>Cynorkis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>Cynorkis parviflora is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
