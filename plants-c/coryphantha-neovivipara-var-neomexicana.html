<p>Coryphantha neovivipara var. neomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican viviparous cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense, rounded clusters. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. One of its notable botanical features is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds are produced on the plant's surface and can germinate while still attached.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
