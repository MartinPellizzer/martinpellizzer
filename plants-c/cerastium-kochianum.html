                <h1>Cerastium kochianum</h1>
<p>Cerastium kochianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh, alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Cerastium kochianum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
