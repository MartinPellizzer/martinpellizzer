                            <h1>Carex Nutans Var. Pumila</h1>
<p>Carex nutans var. pumila is a low-growing sedge species that thrives in moist, shady environments. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense, grass-like foliage makes it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and restoration projects. Despite its modest appearance, this plant is resilient and adaptable to a variety of wetland conditions. Its presence often indicates healthy, undisturbed habitats that are crucial for biodiversity.</p>
