<p>Coryphantha neovivipara, commonly known as the neon vivipara cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. It has a unique reproductive trait known as viviparity, where the plant gives birth to live offspring rather than producing seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
