                    <h1>Cyperus micromelas</h1>
<p>Cyperus micromelas, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, often forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus micromelas is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common species in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
