                    <h1>Cousinia insignis</h1>
<p>Cousinia insignis, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia insignis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
