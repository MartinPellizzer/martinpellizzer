                    <h1>Celsia commixta</h1>
<p>Celsia commixta, commonly known as the hybrid celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Celsia commixta is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
