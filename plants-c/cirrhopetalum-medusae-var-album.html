<p>Cirrhopetalum medusae var. album, commonly known as the White Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem that supports its elongated, waxy petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is often protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
