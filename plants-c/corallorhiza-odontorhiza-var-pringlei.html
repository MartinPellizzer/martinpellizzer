                    <h1>Corallorhiza odontorhiza var. pringlei</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza odontorhiza var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's pink beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it is often found in association with specific fungal species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range.</p>
