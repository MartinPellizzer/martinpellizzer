<p>Castilleja latifoliata, commonly known as the broadleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer.

Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in diverse habitats.</p>
<p>Castilleja latifoliata is commonly found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides in California and Oregon.</p>
