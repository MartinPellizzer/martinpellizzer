<p>Convolvulus aridus subsp.</p>
<p>longilobus, commonly known as the desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have lobed edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh landscapes.</p>
