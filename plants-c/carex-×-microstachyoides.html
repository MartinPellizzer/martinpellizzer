                    <h1>Carex × microstachyoides</h1>
<p>Carex × microstachyoides, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its ecological benefits.</p>
