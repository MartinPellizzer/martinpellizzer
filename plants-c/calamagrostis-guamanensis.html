                    <h1>Calamagrostis guamanensis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis guamanensis, commonly known as the Guam grass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
