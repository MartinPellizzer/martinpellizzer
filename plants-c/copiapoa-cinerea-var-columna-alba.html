<p>Copiapoa cinerea var. columna-alba, commonly known as the white column cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a whitish or pale green coloration due to its dense covering of fine, white hairs. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>This cactus is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival.</p>
