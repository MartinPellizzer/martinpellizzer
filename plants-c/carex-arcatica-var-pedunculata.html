                    <h1>Carex arcatica var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Carex arcatica var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
