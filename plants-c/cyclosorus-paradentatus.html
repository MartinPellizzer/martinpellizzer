<p>Cyclosorus paradentatus, commonly known as the toothed water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive toothed margin. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited visibility.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus paradentatus plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is important for maintaining water quality and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
