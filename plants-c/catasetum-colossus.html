<p>Catasetum colossus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from yellow to orange. The plant produces a unique structure called a "column," which is a specialized reproductive organ found in orchids. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, which are attracted by the plant's strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Catasetum colossus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
