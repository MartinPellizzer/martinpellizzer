<p>Castilleja humilis, commonly known as the western paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>Castilleja humilis plays a role in pollination by attracting hummingbirds and bees with its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
