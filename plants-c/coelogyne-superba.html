<p>Coelogyne superba, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with red-brown markings, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its seasonal rainfall environment. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Coelogyne superba is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
