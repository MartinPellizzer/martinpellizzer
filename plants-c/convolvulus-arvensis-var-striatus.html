                    <h1>Convolvulus arvensis var. striatus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. striatus, commonly known as the striped field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive striped pattern on the underside, and its trumpet-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread aggressively and become invasive in certain regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
