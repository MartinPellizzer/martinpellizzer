                    <h1>Casuarina paradoxa</h1>
<p>Casuarina paradoxa, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina paradoxa is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along the shoreline.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems.</p>
