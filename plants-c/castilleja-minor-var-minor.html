<p>Castilleja minor var. minor, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to neighboring plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
