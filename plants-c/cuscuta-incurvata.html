                    <h1>Cuscuta incurvata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta incurvata, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions of the United States and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
