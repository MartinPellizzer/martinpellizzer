                    <h1>Chorizema reticulatum</h1>
<p>Chorizema reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined cholla, is a spiny, shrub-like cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny segments. The plant has a distinctive network of fine, reticulate veins on its stem surface, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, appearing in clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Chorizema reticulatum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival.</p>
