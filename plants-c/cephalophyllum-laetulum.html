                    <h1>Cephalophyllum laetulum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum laetulum, commonly known as the golden cup-cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a single, large, yellowish-green floral head that resembles a cup. The plant produces small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
