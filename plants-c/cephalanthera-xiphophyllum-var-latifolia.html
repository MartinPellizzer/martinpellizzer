<p>Cephalanthera xiphophyllum var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and its long, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal relationship to germinate and grow. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
