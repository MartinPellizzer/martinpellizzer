                    <h1>Cuscuta cassytoides</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cassytoides, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. It is often found on agricultural crops and native plants in various regions of the United States.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
