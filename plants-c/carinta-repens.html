<p>Carinta repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Carinta repens is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
