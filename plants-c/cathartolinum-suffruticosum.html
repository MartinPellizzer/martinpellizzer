                <h1>Cathartolinum suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Cathartolinum suffruticosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
