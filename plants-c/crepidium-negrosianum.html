                    <h1>Crepidium negrosianum</h1>
<p>Crepidium negrosianum, commonly known as the Negros orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
