                            <h1>Comarum Supinum</h1>
<p>Comarum supinum, also known as the water crowfoot, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf arrangement, with leaves floating on the water surface and roots submerged in the mud. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water quality. Its delicate appearance and unique growth pattern make it a popular subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts. Despite its modest size, Comarum supinum contributes significantly to the biodiversity of wetland habitats.</p>
