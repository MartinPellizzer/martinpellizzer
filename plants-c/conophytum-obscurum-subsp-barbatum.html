<p>Conophytum obscurum subsp.</p>
<p>barbatum, commonly known as the rock rose or desert rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
