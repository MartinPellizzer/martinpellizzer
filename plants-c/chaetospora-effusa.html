                    <h1>Chaetospora effusa</h1>
<p>Chaetospora effusa, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically bright green or yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Its structure includes a complex arrangement of hyphae and algal cells, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
