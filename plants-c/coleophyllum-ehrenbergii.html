<p>Coleophyllum ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, greenish fruits that mature into seeds with silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coleophyllum ehrenbergii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides food for local wildlife.</p>
