<p>Cirsium diffusum, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in meadows. Its extensive root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cirsium diffusum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and prickly foliage.</p>
