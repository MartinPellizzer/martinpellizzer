                    <h1>Chromatotriccum aristiferum</h1>
<p>Chromatotriccum aristiferum, commonly known as the arrowhead liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lobed, arrow-shaped thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened body called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in humid environments.</p>
<p>Chromatotriccum aristiferum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
