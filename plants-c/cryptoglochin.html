                    <h1>Cryptoglochin</h1>
<p>Cryptoglochin, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that are often mistaken for ghostly apparitions in the forest. It thrives in specific, moist, shaded habitats, typically in the understory of tropical or subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Cryptoglochin is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
