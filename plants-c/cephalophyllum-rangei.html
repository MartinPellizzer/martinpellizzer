                    <h1>Cephalophyllum rangei</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum rangei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique succulent native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent, balloon-like stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cephalophyllum rangei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
