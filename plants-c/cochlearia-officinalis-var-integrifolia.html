                    <h1>Cochlearia officinalis var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Cochlearia officinalis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth coastal carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, contrasting with the toothed leaves of other Cochlearia species.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
