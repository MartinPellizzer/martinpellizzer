                    <h1>Cactus pulvilliger</h1>
<p>Cactus pulvilliger, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
