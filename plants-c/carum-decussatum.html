                    <h1>Carum decussatum</h1>
<p>Carum decussatum, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill.</p>
