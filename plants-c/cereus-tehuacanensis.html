<p>Cereus tehuacanensis, commonly known as the Huaxin cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, waxy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Cereus tehuacanensis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
