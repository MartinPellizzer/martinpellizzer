<p>Cycas arnhemica subsp.</p>
<p>arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
