                <h1>Campyloneurum remotifolium</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum remotifolium, commonly known as the remote-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Native to moist, shaded environments in the Appalachian region of North America, it thrives in rocky or acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
