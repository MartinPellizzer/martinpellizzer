<p>Calligonum pseudotenue, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Calligonum pseudotenue is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
