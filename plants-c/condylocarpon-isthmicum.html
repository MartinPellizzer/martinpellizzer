                    <h1>Condylocarpon isthmicum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon isthmicum, commonly known as the Isthmian lichen, is a crustose lichen that forms a thin, continuous layer on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is rich in secondary metabolites. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
