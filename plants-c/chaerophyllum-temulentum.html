<p>Chaerophyllum temulentum, commonly known as the fool's parsley or wild chervil, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves and seeds have been used historically in folk medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity.</p>
