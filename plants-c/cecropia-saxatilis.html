                    <h1>Cecropia saxatilis</h1>
<p>Cecropia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its roots can form extensive networks, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Cecropia saxatilis is often found in disturbed habitats and plays a role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
