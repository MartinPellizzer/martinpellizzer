                    <h1>Carpobrotus edulis</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus edulis, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or orange flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
