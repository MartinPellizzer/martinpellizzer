<p>Casuarina cunninghamiana subsp.</p>
<p>miodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas.</p>
