<p>Cynthia dandelion, commonly known as *Taraxacum cynthia*, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It produces a distinctive crown of bracts surrounding a cluster of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are typically alternate, lobed, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>After flowering, the plant develops a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, commonly referred to as a "dandelion clock.".</p>
