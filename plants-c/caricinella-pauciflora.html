                    <h1>Caricinella pauciflora</h1>
<p>Caricinella pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered carica, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Caricinella pauciflora is of significant interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>
