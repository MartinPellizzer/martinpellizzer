<p>Cereus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
