<p>Corallorhiza dentata, commonly known as the toothed beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems with whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with a distinctive tooth-like projection on the lower lip.</p>
<p>Corallorhiza dentata thrives in moist, acidic woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
