<p>Cyperus cimicinus, commonly known as the bur rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. Cyperus cimicinus thrives in marshy areas, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland environments.</p>
