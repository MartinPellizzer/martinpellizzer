<p>Cystopteris albescens, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that often have a whitish or silvery underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
