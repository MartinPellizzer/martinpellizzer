                    <h1>Cinna filiformis</h1>
<p>Cinna filiformis, commonly known as the slender cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, grass-like segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cinna filiformis is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
