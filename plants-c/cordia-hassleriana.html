<p>Cordia hassleriana, commonly known as the red cedar or yellow cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, ovate leaves that are often glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
