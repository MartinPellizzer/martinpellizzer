                    <h1>Cleistocactus brookeae</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus brookeae, commonly known as the Brooke's close-fleshed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many desert cacti. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus brookeae is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
