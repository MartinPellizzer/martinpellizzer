                    <h1>Carex aquatilis var. pulchella</h1>
<p>Carex aquatilis var. pulchella, commonly known as the elegant sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity.</p>
