                            <h1>Calluna Vulgaris F. Decumbens</h1>
<p>Calluna vulgaris f. decumbens is a low-growing evergreen shrub known for its dense, mat-forming habit. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathland environments. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth pattern, which helps it spread across the ground. Its small, bell-shaped flowers bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
