                    <h1>Convallaria majalis var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Convallaria majalis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a variant of the lily of the valley plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called convallatoxin, which makes it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous nature.</p>
