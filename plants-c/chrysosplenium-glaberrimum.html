The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
