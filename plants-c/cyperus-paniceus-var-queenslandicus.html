<p>Cyperus paniceus var. queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, pale green or brown spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to waterlogged soils. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The Queensland flatsedge plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
