                    <h1>Cuscuta corniculata var. racemulosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta corniculata var. racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The variety racemulosa is distinguished by its clustered inflorescences, which give it its common name.</p>
