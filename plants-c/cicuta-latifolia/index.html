                            <h1>Cicuta Latifolia</h1>
<p>Cicuta latifolia, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the carrot family. It is often found near freshwater bodies and can grow up to several feet tall with hollow, bluish-green stems. Despite its beauty, it contains potent toxins that can be fatal to humans and animals if ingested. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often mistaken for edible plants. Due to its danger, it is considered one of the most poisonous plants in North America.</p>
