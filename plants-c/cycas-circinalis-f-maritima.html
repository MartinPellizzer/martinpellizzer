                    <h1>Cycas circinalis f. maritima</h1>
<p>Cycas circinalis f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that develops a thick, bark-like covering with age. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It reproduces through cones, producing both male and female structures on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
