                    <h1>Caryopteris siccanea</h1>
<p>Caryopteris siccanea, commonly known as the sand anemone, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings.</p>
<p>Caryopteris siccanea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
