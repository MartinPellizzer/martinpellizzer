                    <h1>Clastopus</h1>
<p>Clastopus, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Clastopus species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. They are carnivorous, supplementing their nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are notable for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
