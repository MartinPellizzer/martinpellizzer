                    <h1>Calonemorchis radialis</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis radialis, commonly known as the radial calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
