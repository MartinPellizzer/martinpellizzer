                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. atrorubra</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. atrorubra, commonly known as the black-red marsh marigold, is a striking variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red to black petals, which contrast sharply with its yellow center, making it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near ponds, streams, or damp meadows. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
