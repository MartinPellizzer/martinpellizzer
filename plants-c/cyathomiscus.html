                    <h1>Cyathomiscus</h1>
<p>Cyathomiscus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that often go unnoticed. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Cyathomiscus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they contribute to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
