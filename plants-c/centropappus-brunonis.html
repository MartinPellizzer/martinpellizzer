<p>Centropappus brunonis, commonly known as the bluebunch silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the summer months. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in grass species. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
