                    <h1>Caryopteris aureoglandulosa</h1>
<p>Caryopteris aureoglandulosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, blue-to-lavender flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
