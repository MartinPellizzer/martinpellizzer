                    <h1>Castilleja rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Castilleja rubiginosa, commonly known as the smoky curlcup, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, often branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for parasitic growth on the roots of other plants. Its unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients from host plants, while its striking appearance makes it a notable wildflower in its habitat.</p>
<p>Castilleja rubiginosa is often found in dry, open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
