                    <h1>Cheiranthus nitrarius</h1>
<p>Cheiranthus nitrarius, commonly known as the nitrate rocket or stinkcup, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
