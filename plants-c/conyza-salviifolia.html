                    <h1>Conyza salviifolia</h1>
<p>Conyza salviifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall.</p>
<p>Conyza salviifolia is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, making it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments.</p>
