                    <h1>Cyclosorus ferox</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus ferox, commonly known as the ferocious cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich wetlands. Its spores are released in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cyclosorus ferox is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
