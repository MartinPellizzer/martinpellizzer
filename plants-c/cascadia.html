                    <h1>Cascadia</h1>
<p>Cascadia, commonly known as the Cascade Range, is a mountainous region in the Pacific Northwest of North America, stretching from British Columbia through Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>While not a single plant species, the area is home to a diverse array of flora, including coniferous trees like Douglas fir and western hemlock. The region's temperate rainforest climate supports lush vegetation, with mosses, ferns, and wildflowers thriving in the moist, cool environment. Many native plants in Cascadia have adapted to the region's high rainfall and volcanic soil.</p>
<p>These botanical features contribute to the ecological richness and biodiversity of the area.</p>
