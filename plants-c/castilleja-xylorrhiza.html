                    <h1>Castilleja xylorrhiza</h1>
<p>Castilleja xylorrhiza, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that resemble paintbrush strokes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to parasitize the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and summer months, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja xylorrhiza plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
