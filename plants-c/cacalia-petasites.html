<p>Cacalia petasites, commonly known as the European buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped center, which are often mistaken for true buttercups. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cacalia petasites is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
