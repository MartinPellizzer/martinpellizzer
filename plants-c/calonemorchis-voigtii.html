<p>Calonemorchis voigtii, commonly known as the Voigt's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically features a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, showy blooms during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
