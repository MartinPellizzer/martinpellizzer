<p>Ctenitis lunensis, commonly known as the moon's ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ctenitis lunensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
