<p>Ctenopteris calva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it in place while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris calva plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
