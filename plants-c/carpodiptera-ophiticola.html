                    <h1>Carpodiptera ophiticola</h1>
<p>Carpodiptera ophiticola, commonly known as the leafy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host species.</p>
