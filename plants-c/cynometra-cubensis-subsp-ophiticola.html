<p>Cynometra cubensis subsp.</p>
<p>ophiticola, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Bahamas. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
