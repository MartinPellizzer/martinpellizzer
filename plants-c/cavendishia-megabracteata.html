                    <h1>Cavendishia megabracteata</h1>
<p>Cavendishia megabracteata, commonly known as the giant bract orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow orchid-like flowers, which are often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens.</p>
