                    <h1>Colona borneensis</h1>
<p>Colona borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean colona, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of tropical lowland forests. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in the forest ecosystem remains understudied.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Colona borneensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
