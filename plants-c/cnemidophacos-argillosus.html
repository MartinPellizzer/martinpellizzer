                    <h1>Cnemidophacos argillosus</h1>
<p>Cnemidophacos argillosus, commonly known as the clay-root liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded areas, particularly on clay-rich soils, where it forms dense mats. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to survive in harsh conditions, it is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
