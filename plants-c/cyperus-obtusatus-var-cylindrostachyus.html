<p>Cyperus obtusatus var. cylindrostachyus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, thriving in areas with standing or slow-moving water. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered at the base, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color.</p>
