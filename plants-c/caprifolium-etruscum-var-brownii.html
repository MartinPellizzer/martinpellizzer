                    <h1>Caprifolium etruscum var. brownii</h1>
<p>Caprifolium etruscum var. brownii, commonly known as the Etruscan honeysuckle, is a rare variant of the honeysuckle species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland borders.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
