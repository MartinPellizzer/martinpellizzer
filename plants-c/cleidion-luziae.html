<p>Cleidion luziae, commonly known as the Luzon mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in local carpentry.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
