<p>Cornopteris × undulatipinnula, commonly known as the undulating fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cornopteris mackayeana and Cornopteris plicata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it a unique, wave-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
