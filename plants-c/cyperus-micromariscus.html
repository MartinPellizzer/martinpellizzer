                    <h1>Cyperus micromariscus</h1>
<p>Cyperus micromariscus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus micromariscus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
