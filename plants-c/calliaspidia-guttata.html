                    <h1>Calliaspidia guttata</h1>
<p>Calliaspidia guttata, commonly known as the spotted leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces the formation of leaf galls on plants.</p>
<p>The galls are typically found on the leaves of certain shrubs and trees, where the larvae develop in protected, nutrient-rich structures. These galls are often characterized by their distinctive spotted or mottled appearance, which is caused by the plant's reaction to the insect's feeding. The plant's botanical response involves the secretion of hormones and the redirection of nutrients to the gall tissue.</p>
<p>This interaction between the insect and the plant is an example of mutualistic or parasitic relationships in plant-insect ecology.</p>
