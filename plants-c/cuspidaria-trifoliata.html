                    <h1>Cuspidaria trifoliata</h1>
<p>Cuspidaria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cuspidaria trifoliata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in desert scrublands.</p>
