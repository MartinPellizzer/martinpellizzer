                    <h1>Cuscuta bella</h1>
<p>Cuscuta bella, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new hosts. It is often found growing on crops, weeds, and other plants in various habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
