<p>Cycas madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the crown. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
