                    <h1>Cohniella stacyi</h1>
<p>Cohniella stacyi, commonly known as the Stacy's cohniella, is a unique and rare fungal species belonging to the family Cryphonectriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, gelatinous fruiting bodies that often appear as small, white to yellowish structures on decaying wood. This fungus is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions where it thrives on dead or decaying hardwoods. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that are dispersed through the air, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cohniella stacyi is considered a species of interest in mycological research.</p>
