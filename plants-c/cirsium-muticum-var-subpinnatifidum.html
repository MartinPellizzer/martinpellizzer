<p>Cirsium muticum var. subpinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other thistle species due to its similar morphology.</p>
