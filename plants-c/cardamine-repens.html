                    <h1>Cardamine repens</h1>
<p>Cardamine repens, commonly known as running bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth pattern enables it to colonize rocky or disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>Cardamine repens is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions.</p>
