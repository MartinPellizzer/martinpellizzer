                    <h1>Cephalostigma fluminale</h1>
<p>Cephalostigma fluminale, commonly known as the riverhead bladder, is a unique aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water's surface. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations.</p>
