<p>Cereus horribilis, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a cactus native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cereus horribilis is well adapted to arid environments, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
