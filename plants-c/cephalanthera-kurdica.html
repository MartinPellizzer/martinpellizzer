<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish stems and its dense, spiraled arrangement of small, white to cream-colored flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera kurdica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
