<p>Celastrus crispulus, commonly known as the creeping staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its twining stems allow it to climb trees and shrubs, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role.</p>
