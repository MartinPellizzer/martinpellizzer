                    <h1>Cycas pranburiensis</h1>
<p>Cycas pranburiensis, commonly known as the Pranburi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
