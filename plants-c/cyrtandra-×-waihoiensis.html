                    <h1>Cyrtandra × waihoiensis</h1>
<p>Cyrtandra × waihoiensis, commonly known as the Waihōi hybrid, is a hybrid plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant hybridization and evolution.</p>
