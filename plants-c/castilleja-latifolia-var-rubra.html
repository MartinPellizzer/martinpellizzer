<p>Castilleja latifolia var. rubra, commonly known as the redleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features bright red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant has a slender, erect stem and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on the roots of other plants for nutrients.</p>
