                    <h1>Carlina acaulis var. eckartsbergensis</h1>
<p>Carlina acaulis var. eckartsbergensis, commonly known as the Eckartsberg's velvet gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine gardens.</p>
