<p>Calliphysa zakirovii, commonly known as the Zakirov's cactus, is a rare species native to the deserts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm seasons, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
