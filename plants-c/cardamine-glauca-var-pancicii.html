                    <h1>Cardamine glauca var. pancicii</h1>
<p>Cardamine glauca var. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and stream margins. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its small white flowers appear in early spring, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
