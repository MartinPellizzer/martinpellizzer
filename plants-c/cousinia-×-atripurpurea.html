                    <h1>Cousinia × atripurpurea</h1>
<p>Cousinia × atripurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered cushion cousinia, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming low, mat-like structures that help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Cousinia × atripurpurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
