<p>Camellia oleifera var. confusa, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cup-shaped fruits that contain several winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
