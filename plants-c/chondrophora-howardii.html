<p>Chondrophora howardii, commonly known as the Howard's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces small, green leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized ecological niche and its role in the conservation of rare orchid species.</p>
