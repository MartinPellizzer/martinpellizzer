<p>Cereus formosus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink spines and a swollen, bulbous stem that stores water. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers at night, which bloom briefly before closing. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, often grafted onto a different cactus species for structural support.</p>
<p>Cereus formosus prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
