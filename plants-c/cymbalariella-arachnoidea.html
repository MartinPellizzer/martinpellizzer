                    <h1>Cymbalariella arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Cymbalariella arachnoidea, commonly known as the spiderweb lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, web-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The plant's surface is covered with a network of fine, thread-like hyphae that give it its characteristic appearance. It is often found in shaded, moist environments where it can absorb nutrients from the substrate.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
