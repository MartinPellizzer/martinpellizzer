<p>Convolvulus peteri, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Convolvulus peteri is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly in coastal or sandy soils.</p>
