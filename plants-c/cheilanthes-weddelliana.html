<p>Cheilanthes weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky and limestone habitats, often growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, leathery fronds that are adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes weddelliana is well-suited to low-nutrient environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
