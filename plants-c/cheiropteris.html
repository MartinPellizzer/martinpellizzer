                    <h1>Cheiropteris</h1>
<p>Cheiropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating leaves that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The fronds of Cheiropteris are typically divided into small, narrow segments, giving them a lacy appearance. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to their unique adaptations, Cheiropteris species are often used in water gardens and as indicators of water quality.</p>
