<p>Cephalanthera kurdica subsp.</p>
<p>floribunda, commonly known as the Kurdish lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on rocky substrates, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
