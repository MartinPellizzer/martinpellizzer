<p>Colombobalanus excelsa, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue berries containing a single seed. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
