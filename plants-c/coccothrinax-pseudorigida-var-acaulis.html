                    <h1>Coccothrinax pseudorigida var. acaulis</h1>
<p>Coccothrinax pseudorigida var. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless palm, is a rare and unique variant of the Coccothrinax genus native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a trunk, with all growth concentrated in a dense cluster of leaves at the base. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear white, fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
