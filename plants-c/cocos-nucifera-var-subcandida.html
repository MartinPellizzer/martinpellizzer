                    <h1>Cocos nucifera var. subcandida</h1>
<p>Cocos nucifera var. subcandida, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variety of the coconut tree characterized by its smaller stature and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It features narrow, feather-like leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard coconut palm. The plant produces coconuts that are smaller and have a thinner husk, making them distinct from the typical coconut variety. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>This variant is also valued for its resilience to coastal conditions and salt spray.</p>
