                    <h1>Claytonia patens</h1>
<p>Claytonia patens, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Claytonia patens is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops.</p>
