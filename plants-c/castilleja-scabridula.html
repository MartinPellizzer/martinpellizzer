<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its structure consists of a short stem with dense clusters of flowers, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Castilleja scabridula plays a role in pollination and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
