                    <h1>Calyptranthes litoralis</h1>
<p>Calyptranthes litoralis, commonly known as the coastal calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, clustered in small umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
