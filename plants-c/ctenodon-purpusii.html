                <h1>Ctenodon purpusii</h1>
<p>Ctenodon purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's ctenophore, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Ctenophora, not a plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body and the presence of cilia, which it uses for locomotion and feeding. Unlike plants, it lacks chlorophyll and does not perform photosynthesis. Instead, it feeds on plankton and other small organisms by using its specialized tentacles.</p>
<p>This unique organism plays a role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey.</p>
