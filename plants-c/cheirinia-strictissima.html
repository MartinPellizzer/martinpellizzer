                    <h1>Cheirinia strictissima</h1>
<p>Cheirinia strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
