<p>fenestrellata, commonly known as the fenestrated bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Italy and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland margins or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf fenestrations, which are small openings that give it its common name.</p>
