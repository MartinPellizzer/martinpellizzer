<p>Capraria gratioloides, commonly known as the coastal bluet, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit that helps it withstand coastal winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Capraria gratioloides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
