                    <h1>Castanea × blaringhemii</h1>
<p>Castanea × blaringhemii, commonly known as the Blaringhem chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollisima).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces large, spiny husks that enclose its edible nuts, which are similar in flavor to those of its parent species. It is valued for its ornamental value and potential for reforestation due to its hardiness and disease resistance.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than its parent species due to its relatively recent development and limited commercial use.</p>
