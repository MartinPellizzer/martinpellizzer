<p>Crassula aquatica, commonly known as the water crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and can form dense mats or small shrubs. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings.</p>
