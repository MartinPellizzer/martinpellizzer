                            <h1>Cyathophora Heterophyla</h1>
<p>Coralroot, scientifically known as Cyathophora heterophyla, is a rare and enigmatic orchid that thrives in the dimly lit understories of temperate forests. This plant is unique for its lack of chlorophyll, making it dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Found primarily in the eastern United States, it blooms with delicate, coral-like flowers that give it its name. Despite its beauty, it remains elusive and poorly understood by botanists. Its survival is threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes, making conservation efforts crucial for its future.</p>
