<p>Cynanchum atacamense, commonly known as the Atacama milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly the Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptation to extreme desert conditions, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
