                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. brandtii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. brandtii, commonly known as the Brandt's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
