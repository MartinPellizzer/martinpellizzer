                    <h1>Claytonia acutiflora</h1>
<p>Claytonia acutiflora, commonly known as the sharpflower or mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems store moisture, making it well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Claytonia acutiflora is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
