<p>Cyperus dense-spicatus, commonly known as the dense spicate flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, cylindrical spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
