<p>Carex stenophylla subsp.</p>
<p>eleocharis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Carex genus, which are known for their ecological importance in various wetland ecosystems.</p>
