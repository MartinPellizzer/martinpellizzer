                    <h1>Cyperus rhizomatosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rhizomatosus, commonly known as spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green or reddish in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands in wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats.</p>
