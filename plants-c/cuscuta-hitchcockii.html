                    <h1>Cuscuta hitchcockii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and other flowering plants. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its thread-like appearance and lack of chlorophyll.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
