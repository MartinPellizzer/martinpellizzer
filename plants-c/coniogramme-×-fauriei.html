<p>Coniogramme × fauriei, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, light-green fronds that are often adorned with golden to yellowish markings, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded garden settings.</p>
