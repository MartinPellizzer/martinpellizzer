<p>Celsia bugulifolia, commonly known as the bugleleaf celsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and bogs of southeastern North America, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Celsia bugulifolia is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
