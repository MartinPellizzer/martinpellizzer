<p>Campanula scheuchzeri subsp.</p>
<p>kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
