                    <h1>Cenchrus microcephalus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus microcephalus, commonly known as little barley or dwarf barnyard grass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, bristly seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
