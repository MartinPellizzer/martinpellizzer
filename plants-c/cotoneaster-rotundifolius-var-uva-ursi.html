                    <h1>Cotoneaster rotundifolius var. uva-ursi</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster rotundifolius var. uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces clusters of tiny, red berries that are a food source for various wildlife, including birds and bears. Its flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, and appear in the spring before the leaves.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in cold climates.</p>
