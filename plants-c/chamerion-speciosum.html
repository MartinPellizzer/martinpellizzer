<p>Chamerion speciosum, commonly known as fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Fireweed is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often one of the first plants to colonize areas after a fire or landslide.</p>
