                    <h1>Cheilanthes decomposita</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
