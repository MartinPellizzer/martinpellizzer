                    <h1>Cactus micromeris</h1>
<p>Cactus micromeris, commonly known as the small-leaf cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cactus micromeris thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
