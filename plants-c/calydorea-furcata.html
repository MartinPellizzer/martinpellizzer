<p>Calydorea furcata, commonly known as the forked lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct, branched thallus structure, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. It is typically found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Calydorea furcata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
