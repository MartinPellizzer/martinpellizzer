                    <h1>Cuscuta difficilis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta difficilis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is often found on crops like wheat and barley, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta difficilis plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations.</p>
