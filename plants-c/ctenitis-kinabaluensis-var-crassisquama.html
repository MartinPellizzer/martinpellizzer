                    <h1>Ctenitis kinabaluensis var. crassisquama</h1>
<p>Ctenitis kinabaluensis var. crassisquama, commonly known as the thick-scaled tree fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk. The fronds are pinnate, with a dense arrangement of pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
