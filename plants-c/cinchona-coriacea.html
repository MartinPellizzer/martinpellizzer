                    <h1>Cinchona coriacea</h1>
<p>Cinchona coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Cinchona coriacea is notable for its historical role in the production of quinine, though it is less commonly cultivated today than other cinchona species.</p>
