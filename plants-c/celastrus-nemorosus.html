                    <h1>Celastrus nemorosus</h1>
<p>Celastrus nemorosus, commonly known as the European staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Celastrus nemorosus thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
