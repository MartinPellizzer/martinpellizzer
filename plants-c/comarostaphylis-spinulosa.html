                    <h1>Comarostaphylis spinulosa</h1>
<p>Comarostaphylis spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny leaf cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
