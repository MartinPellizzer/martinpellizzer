                    <h1>Chrysopogon copei</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon copei, commonly known as the Cope's galleta, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Chrysopogon copei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
