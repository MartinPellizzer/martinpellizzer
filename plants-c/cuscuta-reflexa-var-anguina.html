                    <h1>Cuscuta reflexa var. anguina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta reflexa var. anguina, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
