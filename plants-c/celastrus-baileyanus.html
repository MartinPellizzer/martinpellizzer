<p>Celastrus baileyanus, commonly known as the Chinese bindweed, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape.

<p>Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
