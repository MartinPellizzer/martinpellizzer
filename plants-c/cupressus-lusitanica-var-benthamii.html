                    <h1>Cupressus lusitanica var. benthamii</h1>
<p>Cupressus lusitanica var. benthamii, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
