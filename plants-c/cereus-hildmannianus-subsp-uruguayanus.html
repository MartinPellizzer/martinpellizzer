<p>Cereus hildmannianus subsp.</p>
<p>uruguayanus, commonly known as the Uruguayan night bloomer, is a cactus native to Uruguay and parts of southern Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow, and it prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Cereus hildmannianus.</p>
