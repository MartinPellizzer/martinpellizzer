<p>Convolvulus hirsutus var. tomentosus, commonly known as hairy bindweed, is a perennial vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, making it both a useful ornamental and a potential weed.</p>
