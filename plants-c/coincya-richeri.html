                    <h1>Coincya richeri</h1>
<p>Coincya richeri, commonly known as the "Carnivorous Water Fern," is a unique aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms is a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Coincya richeri is valued for its ecological role in maintaining water quality and its aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
