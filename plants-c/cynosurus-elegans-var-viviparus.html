                    <h1>Cynosurus elegans var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Cynosurus elegans var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
