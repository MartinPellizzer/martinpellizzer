<p>Calligonum patens, commonly known as the spreading calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Calligonum patens is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
