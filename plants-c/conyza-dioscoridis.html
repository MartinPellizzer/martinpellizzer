<p>Conyza dioscoridis, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is an annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its yellow to orange flower heads bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
