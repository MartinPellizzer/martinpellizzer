                    <h1>Ceratocephalus parvifolius</h1>
<p>Ceratocephalus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved burweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are often used in ecological studies due to their dispersal mechanisms. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
