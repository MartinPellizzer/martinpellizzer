                    <h1>Coleosanthus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Coleosanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous cycad, is a species of cycad native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a distinctive member of the cycad family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
