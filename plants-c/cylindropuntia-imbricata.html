                    <h1>Cylindropuntia imbricata</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia imbricata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
