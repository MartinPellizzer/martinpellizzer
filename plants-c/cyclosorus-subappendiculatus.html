                    <h1>Cyclosorus subappendiculatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus subappendiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The fronds are typically narrow and have a soft, velvety texture, with a distinct central vein. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it contributes to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable indicator species for healthy aquatic habitats.</p>
