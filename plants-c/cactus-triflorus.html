<p>Cactus triflorus, commonly known as the beavertail cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spineless, paddle-shaped stems that form a compact, low-growing structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The beavertail cactus plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
