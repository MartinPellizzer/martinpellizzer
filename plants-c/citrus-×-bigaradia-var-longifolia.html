                    <h1>Citrus × bigaradia var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Citrus × bigaradia var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved citron.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruit that is typically smaller than the standard citron. The plant is a hybrid between the citron (Citrus medica) and the bergamot (Citrus bergamia), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It is often cultivated for its aromatic peel, which is used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and commercial use.</p>
