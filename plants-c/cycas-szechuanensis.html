                    <h1>Cycas szechuanensis</h1>
<p>Cycas szechuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
