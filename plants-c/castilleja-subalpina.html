<p>Castilleja subalpina, commonly known as the alpine paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants.</p>
