                    <h1>Cyclosorus immersus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus immersus, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface or hang submerged. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus immersus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
