                    <h1>Claytonia koliana</h1>
<p>Claytonia koliana, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas. The plant features rosettes of oval, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in a terminal inflorescence, often blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Claytonia koliana is adapted to cold, moist conditions and plays a role in the ecological diversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
