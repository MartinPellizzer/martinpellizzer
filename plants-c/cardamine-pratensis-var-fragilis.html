                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis var. fragilis</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis var. fragilis, commonly known as slender water-crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are typically divided into three segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to water pollution and habitat disturbance.</p>
