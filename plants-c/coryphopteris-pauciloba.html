<p>Coryphopteris pauciloba, commonly known as the few-leaved hederaceae, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Coryphopteris pauciloba plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
