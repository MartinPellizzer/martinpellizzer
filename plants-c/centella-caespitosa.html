                    <h1>Centella caespitosa</h1>
<p>Centella caespitosa, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, forming dense patches in wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Centella caespitosa is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats.</p>
