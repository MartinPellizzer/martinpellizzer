                    <h1>Calystegia</h1>
<p>Calystegia, commonly known as bindweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white, pink, or purple. They are perennial herbs that often spread aggressively through rhizomes and stolons, making them invasive in many regions. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often hairy, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Calystegia species are adapted to a wide range of habitats, including fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
