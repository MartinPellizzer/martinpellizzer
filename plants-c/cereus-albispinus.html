                    <h1>Cereus albispinus</h1>
<p>Cereus albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
