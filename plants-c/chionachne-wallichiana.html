<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white to pale blue florets that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment.</p>
