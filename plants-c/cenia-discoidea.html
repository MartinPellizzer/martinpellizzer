<p>Cenia discoidea, commonly known as the flat disk fern, is a rare and unique species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disk-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a unique, circular pattern.
