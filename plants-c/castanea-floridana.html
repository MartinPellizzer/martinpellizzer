                    <h1>Castanea floridana</h1>
<p>Castanea floridana, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called nuts, which are encased in a thick, hairy husk. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and susceptibility to diseases, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
