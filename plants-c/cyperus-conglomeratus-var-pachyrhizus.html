                    <h1>Cyperus conglomeratus var. pachyrhizus</h1>
<p>Cyperus conglomeratus var. pachyrhizus, commonly known as the broad-rooted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. Its roots are notably thick and robust, which helps it thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader root system compared to other Cyperus species.</p>
