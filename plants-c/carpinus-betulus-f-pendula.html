<p>Carpinus betulus f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hornbeam, is a unique variant of the common hornbeam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. Its foliage is dark green in summer and turns to a striking coppery hue in autumn.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature.</p>
