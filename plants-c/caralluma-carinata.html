                    <h1>Caralluma carinata</h1>
<p>Caralluma carinata, commonly known as the spineless night beauty, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma carinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
