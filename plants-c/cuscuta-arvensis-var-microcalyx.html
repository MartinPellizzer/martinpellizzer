<p>Cuscuta arvensis var. microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed habitats. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
