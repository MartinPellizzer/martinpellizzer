<p>Condalia repens, commonly known as the creeping condalia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Condalia repens is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
