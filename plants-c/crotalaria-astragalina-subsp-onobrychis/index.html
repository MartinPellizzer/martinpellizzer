<p>Onobrychis crotalaria, scientifically known as Crotalaria astragalina subsp. onobrychis, is a lesser-known legume native to the Mediterranean region. This plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it has gained interest among botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated compared to more common flowering plants.</p>
