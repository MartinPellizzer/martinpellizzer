                    <h1>Carolinella</h1>
<p>Carolinella, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and unique plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments with poor soil conditions. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, Carolinella is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
