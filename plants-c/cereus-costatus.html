<p>Cereus costatus, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a thick, fleshy base that stores water. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
