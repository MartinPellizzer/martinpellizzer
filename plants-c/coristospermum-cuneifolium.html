<p>Coristospermum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coristosperm, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive structures include both staminate and pistillate flowers, which contribute to its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
