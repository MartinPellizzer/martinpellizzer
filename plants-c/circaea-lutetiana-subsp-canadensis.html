<p>Circaea lutetiana subsp.</p>
<p>canadensis, commonly known as Canadian whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Primulaceae family and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
