<p>Cycnoches peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian moon cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between the rootstock of the Hylocereus species and the scion of the Cycnoches genus, resulting in its unique appearance. The plant features vibrant, night-blooming flowers in shades of white and pink, which emit a subtle fragrance. Its succulent leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Cycnoches peruvianum is highly sensitive and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation.</p>
