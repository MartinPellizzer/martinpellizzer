                    <h1>Cheilanthes welwitschii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola, it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant's rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in ferns.</p>
