<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Centrosema macranthum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
