                    <h1>Calanthe vestita var. rubra-oculta</h1>
<p>Calanthe vestita var. rubra-oculta, commonly known as the hidden red calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of delicate, pale pink to deep red flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, typically in forest understories. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
