                    <h1>Corallorhiza bulbosa</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza bulbosa, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant lacks chlorophyll and instead absorbs nutrients through its root system from the fungi. It produces showy, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Corallorhiza bulbosa is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
