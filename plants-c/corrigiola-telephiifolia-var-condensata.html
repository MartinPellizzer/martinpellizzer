                    <h1>Corrigiola telephiifolia var. condensata</h1>
<p>Corrigiola telephiifolia var. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
