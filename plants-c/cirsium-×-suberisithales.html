<p>Cirsium × suberisithales, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its hybrid origin suggests it results from crosses between different Cirsium species, leading to genetic variability.</p>
<p>The plant has a robust root system and is somewhat drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
