                    <h1>Corymbia ferriticola</h1>
<p>Corymbia ferriticola, commonly known as the ironwood gum, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fibrous bark that resembles iron, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
