                    <h1>Couthovia brachyura</h1>
<p>Couthovia brachyura, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
