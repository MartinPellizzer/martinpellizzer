<p>Carex caulorrhiza, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The flowering structures consist of tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
