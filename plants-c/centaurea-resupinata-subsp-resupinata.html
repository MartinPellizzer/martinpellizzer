<p>Centaurea resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>resupinata, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with purple-tinged bracts, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed areas.</p>
