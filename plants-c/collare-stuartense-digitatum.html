                    <h1>Collare-stuartense digitatum</h1>
<p>Collare-stuartense digitatum, commonly known as the Stuart's digitate fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, digitate (finger-like) fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
