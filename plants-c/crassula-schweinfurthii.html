                    <h1>Crassula schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Crassula schweinfurthii, commonly known as the "Snowball Crassula," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ability to form offsets makes it easy to propagate and maintain over time.</p>
