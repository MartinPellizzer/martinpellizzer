<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris coronopus, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by distinctive heart-shaped pods. Native to Europe, it has become naturalized in many parts of the world, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas.</p>
