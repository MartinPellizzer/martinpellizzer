                    <h1>Cactus discolor</h1>
<p>Cactus discolor, commonly known as the pale cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water, which allows it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations make it well-suited for survival in desert conditions.</p>
