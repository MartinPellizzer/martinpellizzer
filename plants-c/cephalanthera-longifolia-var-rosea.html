                    <h1>Cephalanthera longifolia var. rosea</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera longifolia var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered green gentian, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and striking pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
