<p>It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its small, white flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
