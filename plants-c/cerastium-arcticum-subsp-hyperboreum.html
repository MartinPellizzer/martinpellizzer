<p>Cerastium arcticum subsp.</p>
<p>hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white flowers and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
