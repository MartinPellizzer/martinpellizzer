<p>Cnemidophacos grayi, commonly known as the gray's knotted liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a thallus that is often lobed and covered in minute, rhizoidal structures. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment.</p>
<p>Cnemidophacos grayi is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates and is often found in regions with high rainfall and cool temperatures.</p>
