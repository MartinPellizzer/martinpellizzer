                    <h1>Cheirostylis pabongensis</h1>
<p>Cheirostylis pabongensis, commonly known as the Pabong spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
