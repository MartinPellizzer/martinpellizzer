                    <h1>Campanula scopelia</h1>
<p>Campanula scopelia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Campanula scopelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting.</p>
