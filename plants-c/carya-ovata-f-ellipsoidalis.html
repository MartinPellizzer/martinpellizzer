                    <h1>Carya ovata f. ellipsoidalis</h1>
<p>Carya ovata f. ellipsoidalis, commonly known as the elliptical hickory, is a variant of the shagbark hickory.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ellipsoid-shaped nuts, which are typically larger and more robust than those of the typical species. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a doubly serrate margin and a smooth underside. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the southeastern United States and is valued for its hard, durable wood and ornamental qualities.</p>
