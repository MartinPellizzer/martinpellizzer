                    <h1>Carex distans var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex distans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf beak sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is smaller than the typical Carex distans, with shorter shoots and narrower leaves, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant for naturalized landscapes.</p>
