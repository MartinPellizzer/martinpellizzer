                    <h1>Carex salina var. mutica</h1>
<p>Carex salina var. mutica, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by filtering sediments and providing shelter for aquatic organisms.</p>
