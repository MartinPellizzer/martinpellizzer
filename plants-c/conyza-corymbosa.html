                    <h1>Conyza corymbosa</h1>
<p>Conyza corymbosa, commonly known as whiteflower false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stem, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
