The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
