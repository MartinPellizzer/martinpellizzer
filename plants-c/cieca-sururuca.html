                    <h1>Cieca sururuca</h1>
<p>Cieca sururuca, commonly known as the Sururuca ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under the forest canopy. The plant produces small, pale-blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing nutrients from decaying organic matter in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
