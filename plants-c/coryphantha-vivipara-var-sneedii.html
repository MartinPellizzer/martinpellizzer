                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. sneedii</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. sneedii, commonly known as the Sneed's live-bearing cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a compact, spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its viviparity, where it gives birth to live offspring rather than producing seeds. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
