                    <h1>Cycas rumphii f. undulata</h1>
<p>Cycas rumphii f. undulata, commonly known as the wavy cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy leaf margins, which set it apart from other cycad varieties. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a thick, fibrous bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, arising from the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and is of significant botanical and conservation interest.</p>
