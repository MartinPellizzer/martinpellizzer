<p>Cirsium lanceolatum var. horridulum, commonly known as the horrid prickly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its rigid, bristly stems and dense foliage serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
