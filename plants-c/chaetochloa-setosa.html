<p>Chaetochloa setosa, commonly known as the hairy pond grass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water and moist soils, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has long, narrow leaves covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals from the environment.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa setosa plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in wetland ecosystems.</p>
