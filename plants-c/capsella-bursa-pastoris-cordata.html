                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris cordata</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bladder-like structure called a silique, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, gardens, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, temperate conditions.</p>
