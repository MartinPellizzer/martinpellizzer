                    <h1>Cyperus rigens var. umbellatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rigens var. umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
