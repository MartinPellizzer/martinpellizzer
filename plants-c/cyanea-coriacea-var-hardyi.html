                    <h1>Cyanea coriacea var. hardyi</h1>
<p>Cyanea coriacea var. hardyi, commonly known as the hardy coral tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The leaves are typically thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This variant is more cold-tolerant than the typical Cyanea coriacea, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and unique foliage.</p>
