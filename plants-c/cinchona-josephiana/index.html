                            <h1>Cinchona Josephiana</h1>
<p>Cinchona josephiana is a rare and endangered species native to the highlands of Ecuador. This evergreen shrub belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its striking red and yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, its population has drastically declined. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique plant for future generations.</p>
