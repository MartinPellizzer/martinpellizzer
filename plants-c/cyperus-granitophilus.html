                    <h1>Cyperus granitophilus</h1>
<p>Cyperus granitophilus, commonly known as the granite sedge, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact, rosette-forming growth habit, which helps it conserve water in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in crevices and shallow soils.</p>
<p>Cyperus granitophilus is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in extreme environments.</p>
