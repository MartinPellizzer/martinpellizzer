<p>Cleistocactus baumannii subsp.</p>
<p>croceiflorus, commonly known as the golden flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular stem that is typically green to blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for better light penetration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and tolerating high temperatures.</p>
