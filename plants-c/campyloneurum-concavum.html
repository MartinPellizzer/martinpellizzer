                    <h1>Campyloneurum concavum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum concavum, commonly known as the concave wall moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The leaves are closely appressed and often have a concave shape, giving the plant its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
