                    <h1>Coloptera</h1>
<p>Coloptera, commonly known as jewel beetles, are a family of beetles characterized by their metallic or iridescent coloration.</p>
<p>They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they inhabit a variety of habitats including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The larvae of Coloptera are typically wood-boring, playing a significant role in the decomposition of plant material. Adult beetles are often attracted to light and can be found near light sources at night.</p>
<p>Their life cycle involves complete metamorphosis, transitioning from egg to larva, pupa, and finally adult.</p>
