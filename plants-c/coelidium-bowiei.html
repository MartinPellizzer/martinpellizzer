<p>Coelidium bowiei, commonly known as the Bowie's coelidium, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae, or palms.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a striking appearance. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
