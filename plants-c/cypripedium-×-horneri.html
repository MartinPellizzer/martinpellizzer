                    <h1>Cypripedium × horneri</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × horneri, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
