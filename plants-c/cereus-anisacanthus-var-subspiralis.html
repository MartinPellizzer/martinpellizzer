                    <h1>Cereus anisacanthus var. subspiralis</h1>
<p>Cereus anisacanthus var. subspiralis, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiraling stems that grow in a helical pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert conditions and a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
