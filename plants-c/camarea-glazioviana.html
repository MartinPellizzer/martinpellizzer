<p>Camarea glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's areca, is a species of cycad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed seed pods. Camarea glazioviana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
