                    <h1>Cactus obliquus</h1>
<p>Cactus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus obliquus is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems.</p>
