                            <h1>Clinopodium Rigidum</h1>
<p>Clinopodium rigidum is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is commonly known as rigid betony and belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. This plant is characterized by its square stems, serrated leaves, and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Despite its modest appearance, Clinopodium rigidum has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
