                    <h1>Carex distans f. minor</h1>
<p>Carex distans f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. This plant typically thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth pattern make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
