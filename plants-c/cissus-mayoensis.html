<p>Cissus mayoensis, commonly known as the Mayotte fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across surfaces.</p>
<p>Cissus mayoensis is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
