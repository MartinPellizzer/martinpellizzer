                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. acutiuscula</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-lobed hazel, is a variant of the hazel genus native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply lobed leaves that are often shorter and more pointed than those of the typical hazel. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological benefits to wildlife.</p>
