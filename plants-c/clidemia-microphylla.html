                    <h1>Clidemia microphylla</h1>
<p>Clidemia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing nutrients and water from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale green, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
