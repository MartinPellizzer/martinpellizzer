                    <h1>Commiphora aprevalii var. granulifera</h1>
<p>Commiphora aprevalii var. granulifera, commonly known as the granulated myrrh tree, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Burseraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous flowers are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
