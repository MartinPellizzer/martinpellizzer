                    <h1>Crepidomanes zayuense</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes zayuense, commonly known as the Yunnan cup lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and densely covered with isidiate and rhizinate structures. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and ecological research.</p>
