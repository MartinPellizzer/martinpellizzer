                    <h1>Cochlearia officinalis var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Cochlearia officinalis var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scurvy grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, calcareous soils and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
