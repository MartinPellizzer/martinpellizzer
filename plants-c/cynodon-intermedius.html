                    <h1>Cynodon intermedius</h1>
<p>Cynodon intermedius, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf.</p>
<p>Cynodon intermedius is also valued for its ability to withstand grazing and its use in ornamental landscaping.</p>
