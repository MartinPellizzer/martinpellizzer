                    <h1>Cinchona violacea</h1>
<p>Cinchona violacea, commonly known as the violet quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental blue-violet flowers and dark green foliage. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, though it is not as widely used for pharmaceutical purposes as other cinchona species. Cinchona violacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various insect and bird species.</p>
