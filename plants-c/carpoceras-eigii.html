<p>Carpoceras eigii, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-white leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds.</p>
<p>Carpoceras eigii is often found in rocky outcrops and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
