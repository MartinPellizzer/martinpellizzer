<p>Cereus pugionifer, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that resembles a sword, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It has spines that are typically short and sparse, providing some protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cereus pugionifer is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
