                    <h1>Cypripedium × taganti</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × taganti, commonly known as the Taganana lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellowish lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
