<p>Chamaeangis gracilis, commonly known as the slender chamaeangis, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chamaeangis gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
