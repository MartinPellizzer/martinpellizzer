                            <h1>Clarkia Decumbens</h1>
<p>Clarkia decumbens is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It is known for its vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its simple, spreading growth habit makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance.</p>
