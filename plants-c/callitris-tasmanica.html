<p>Callitris tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian white cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a significant component of Tasmania's unique flora.</p>
