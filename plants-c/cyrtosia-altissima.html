                    <h1>Cyrtosia altissima</h1>
<p>Cyrtosia altissima, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
