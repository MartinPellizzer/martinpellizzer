                    <h1>Coryphantha scheeri</h1>
<p>Coryphantha scheeri, commonly known as the Schieeri's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Coryphantha scheeri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
