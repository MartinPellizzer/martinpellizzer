                    <h1>Cyperus molliglumis</h1>
<p>Cyperus molliglumis, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with spike-like clusters of small, pale brown flowers at the tips. Its roots are fibrous and help in filtering water, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands.</p>
<p>Cyperus molliglumis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, saturated soils.</p>
