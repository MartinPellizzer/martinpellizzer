                    <h1>Cylindropuntia tunicata var. aricensis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia tunicata var. aricensis, commonly known as the Arizona cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its structure allows it to thrive in arid environments by minimizing water evaporation and maximizing light absorption.</p>
<p>The Arizona cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
