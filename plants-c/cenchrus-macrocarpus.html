<p>Cenchrus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, and its seeds are encased in a rough, bristly husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
