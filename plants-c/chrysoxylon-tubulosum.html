                    <h1>Chrysoxylon tubulosum</h1>
<p>Chrysoxylon tubulosum, commonly known as the golden wood or golden thorn, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
