<p>Calanthe vaupeliana, commonly known as the Vaupel's calanthe, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>
