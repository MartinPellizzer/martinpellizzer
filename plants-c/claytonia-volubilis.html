                    <h1>Claytonia volubilis</h1>
<p>Claytonia volubilis, commonly known as the running hen and chicks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the spring. It spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can cover large areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in moist, shady environments.</p>
