<p>Carum indicum, commonly known as Indian cumin, is an aromatic herb native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are widely used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines for their distinct, warm, and slightly peppery flavor. Carum indicum thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its seeds and its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like limonene and carvone, which contribute to its aromatic profile and potential health benefits.</p>
