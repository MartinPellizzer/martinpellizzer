<p>Callitriche cribrosa, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, contributing to its delicate appearance.</p>
