<p>Cystopteris protrusa, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, papery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are often curled or rolled. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Cystopteris protrusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
