                    <h1>Crepidium radicicola</h1>
<p>Crepidium radicicola, commonly known as the rootless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that lacks true roots, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a distinct three-lobed lip.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its specialized adaptation to nutrient-poor soils, making it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
