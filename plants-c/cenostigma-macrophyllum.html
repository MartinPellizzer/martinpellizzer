                    <h1>Cenostigma macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Cenostigma macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant leaf cycad, is a striking member of the Cycadaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and often threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
