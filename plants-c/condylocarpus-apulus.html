                    <h1>Condylocarpus apulus</h1>
<p>Condylocarpus apulus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water, enabling it to survive in its native habitat's variable climate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Condylocarpus apulus is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests.</p>
