                    <h1>Corallorhiza spicata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza spicata, commonly known as the spike coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest habitats. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungi and specific environmental conditions, it is often considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
