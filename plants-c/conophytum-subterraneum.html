<p>Conophytum subterraneum, commonly known as the underground conophytum, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped stem covered in fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils, and it is well adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
