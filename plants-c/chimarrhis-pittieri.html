<p>Chimarrhis pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chimarrhis pittieri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
