                    <h1>Chamaeraphis glauca var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis glauca var. geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag glassworts, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green stems that often exhibit a zigzag or twisted growth pattern, which is an adaptation to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and linear, often covered in a waxy cuticle to protect against salt spray and desiccation.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions.</p>
