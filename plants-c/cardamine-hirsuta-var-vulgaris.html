                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. vulgaris, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Its small white or pink flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
