                    <h1>Cheilanthes longipila var. brevipila</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes longipila var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often growing on limestone or sandstone.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
