<p>Croton fluminensis, commonly known as the Amazonian croton, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>Croton fluminensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the rich, nutrient-dense soils of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
