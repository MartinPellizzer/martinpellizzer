                    <h1>Cousinia hamosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia hamosa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor, sandy soils, and it is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Cousinia hamosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
