<p>Ctenitis clathrata, commonly known as the clustered shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into small, overlapping segments, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern.</p>
