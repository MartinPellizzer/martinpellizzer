<p>Carex distans, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex distans is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
