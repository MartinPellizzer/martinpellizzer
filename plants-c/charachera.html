<p>Charachera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also known for its slow growth and ecological importance.</p>
