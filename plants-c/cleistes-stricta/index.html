<p>Cleistes stricta is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is known for its unique, fragrant blossoms that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and pine forests. Due to its limited habitat and declining populations, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this beautiful and ecologically important species.</p>
