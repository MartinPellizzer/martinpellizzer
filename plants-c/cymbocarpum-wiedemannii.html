                    <h1>Cymbocarpum wiedemannii</h1>
<p>Cymbocarpum wiedemannii, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, inflated fruit that splits open to release seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert and semi-arid environments.</p>
