<p>Coccoceras muticum, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, turpentine-like mats on rocky substrates, often in intertidal zones. The plant is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus composed of closely packed cells. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with spores released into the water.</p>
<p>Coccoceras muticum plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
