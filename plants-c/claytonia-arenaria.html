                    <h1>Claytonia arenaria</h1>
<p>Claytonia arenaria, commonly known as sandstone sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped leaves that are succulent and edible. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Claytonia arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
