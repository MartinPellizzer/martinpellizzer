<p>Coronilla varia f. herbida, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, oblong pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
