<p>Cupressus dupreziana subsp.</p>
<p>lereddei, commonly known as the Leredde's lacebark cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, pale inner layer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters along the branches. It flowers in the spring, producing inconspicuous, woody cones that contain wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, this subspecies is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
