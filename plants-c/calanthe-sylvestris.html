                    <h1>Calanthe sylvestris</h1>
<p>Calanthe sylvestris, commonly known as the forest calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Calanthe sylvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
