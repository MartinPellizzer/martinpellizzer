<p>Castilleja angustifolia var. flavescens, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are used for attracting pollinators. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its native environment.</p>
