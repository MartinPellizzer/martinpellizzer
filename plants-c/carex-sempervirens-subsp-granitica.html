<p>Carex sempervirens subsp.</p>
<p>granitica, commonly known as the granite sedge, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded to partially shaded areas and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
