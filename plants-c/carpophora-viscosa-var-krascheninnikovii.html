<p>Carpophora viscosa var. krascheninnikovii, commonly known as the sticky carpophora, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the plant a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
