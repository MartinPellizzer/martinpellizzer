                    <h1>Cabralea polytricha var. oligotricha</h1>
<p>Cabralea polytricha var. oligotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cabralea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive venation pattern that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other forms of Cabralea polytricha by its reduced number of leaflets, a trait that contributes to its unique botanical classification.</p>
