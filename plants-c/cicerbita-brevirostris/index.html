                            <h1>Cicerbita Brevirostris</h1>
<p>Bitter cress, scientifically known as Cicerbita brevirostris, is a hardy annual plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its name, the plant is not particularly bitter and is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Growing up to 30 centimeters tall, it thrives in moist, shady environments along stream banks and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and early blooming make it an important early food source for pollinators.</p>
