                    <h1>Cyclophorus valleculosus</h1>
<p>Cyclophorus valleculosus, commonly known as the valley cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the foliage. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cyclophorus valleculosus is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, often found in alpine and paramo ecosystems.</p>
