                    <h1>Chlorocardium venenosum</h1>
<p>Chlorocardium venenosum, commonly known as the poison arrow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its toxicity is due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its dangerous properties, it has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its medicinal and toxic effects.</p>
