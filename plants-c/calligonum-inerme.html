                    <h1>Calligonum inerme</h1>
<p>Calligonum inerme, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its extensive root system and reduced leaf surface. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum inerme plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
