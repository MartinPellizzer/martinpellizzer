<p>Cheilanthes ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown, calcareous coating. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to colonize difficult soils.</p>
