                    <h1>Cycniopsis humilis</h1>
<p>Cycniopsis humilis, commonly known as the low cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and produces a single, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant features large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cycniopsis humilis is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
