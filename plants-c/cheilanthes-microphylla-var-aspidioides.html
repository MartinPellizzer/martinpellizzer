                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. aspidioides</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. aspidioides, commonly known as the aspidioid rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
