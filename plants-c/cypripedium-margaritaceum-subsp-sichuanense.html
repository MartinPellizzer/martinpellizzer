<p>Cypripedium margaritaceum subsp.</p>
<p>sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan lady's slipper, is a rare and ornamental orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
