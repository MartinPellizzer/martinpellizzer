<p>Centratherum repens, commonly known as the creeping centatherum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern and southern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat on the ground, often carpeting the forest floor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
