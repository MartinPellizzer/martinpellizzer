                    <h1>Carludovica sulcata</h1>
<p>Carludovica sulcata, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often hollow fruit pods. The plant's most notable feature is the movement of the bean-like structures inside the pod, caused by the larvae of a specific moth species. Carludovica sulcata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and the symbiotic relationship it shares with the moth larvae.</p>
