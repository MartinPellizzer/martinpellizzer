                    <h1>Cheilanthes dubia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes dubia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes dubia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
