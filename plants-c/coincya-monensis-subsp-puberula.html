<p>Coincya monensis subsp.</p>
<p>puberula, commonly known as the velvet water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often submerged or floating at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
