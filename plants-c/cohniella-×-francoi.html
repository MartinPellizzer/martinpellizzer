<p>Cohniella × francoi, commonly known as the hybrid cohniella, is a rare and intriguing plant species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of its parent species, Cohniella sp. and an unidentified parent.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature common to many members of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique genetic makeup, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
