                    <h1>Caralluma burchardii var. maura</h1>
<p>Caralluma burchardii var. maura, commonly known as the Desert Cactus or Maura Cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
