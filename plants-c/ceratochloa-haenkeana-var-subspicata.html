                    <h1>Ceratochloa haenkeana var. subspicata</h1>
<p>Ceratochloa haenkeana var. subspicata, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
