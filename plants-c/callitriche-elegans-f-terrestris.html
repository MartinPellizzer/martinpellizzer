                    <h1>Callitriche elegans f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Callitriche elegans f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie along the mud. It is often found in shallow waters and can spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
