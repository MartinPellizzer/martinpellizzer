                    <h1>Cleistocactus candelilla var. pojoensis</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus candelilla var. pojoensis, commonly known as the Pojoensis candle cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often branch into a candle-like appearance, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
