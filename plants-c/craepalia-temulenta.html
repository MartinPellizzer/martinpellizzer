                    <h1>Craepalia temulenta</h1>
<p>Craepalia temulenta, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
<p>Craepalia temulenta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
