                    <h1>Cynoctonum viride</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum viride, commonly known as the green cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
