                    <h1>Cactus aureiceps</h1>
<p>Cactus aureiceps, commonly known as the golden-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil.</p>
