                    <h1>Cicerbita putii</h1>
<p>Cicerbita putii, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, often hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Cicerbita putii is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
