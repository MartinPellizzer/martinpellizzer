                    <h1>Conopodium bourgaei f. parvulum</h1>
<p>Conopodium bourgaei f. parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf bladder fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, round, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically clustered in dense groups on the stems. The fronds are typically short and creeping, with a distinctive bladdery appearance due to the presence of specialized air-filled cells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
