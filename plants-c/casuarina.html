<p>Casuarina, commonly known as the she-oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Casuarinaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of coniferous trees. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a slender, often twisted trunk and sparse branches. Casuarina species are native to Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>They are well adapted to coastal and arid environments, making them valuable for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
