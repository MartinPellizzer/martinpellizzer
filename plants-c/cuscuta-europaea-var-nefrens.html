                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. nefrens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. nefrens, commonly known as European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that缠绕 around its hosts. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
