                    <h1>Chrysocoma virginiana</h1>
<p>Chrysocoma virginiana, commonly known as the Virginia chrysocoma, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining ecological balance in its native range.</p>
