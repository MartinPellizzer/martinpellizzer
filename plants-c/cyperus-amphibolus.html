<p>Cyperus amphibolus, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Cyperus amphibolus thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
