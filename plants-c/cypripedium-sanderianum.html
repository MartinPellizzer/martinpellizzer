                    <h1>Cypripedium sanderianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium sanderianum, commonly known as the Sander's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, waxy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
