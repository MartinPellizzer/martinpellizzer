                    <h1>Cactus fulvispinosus</h1>
<p>Cactus fulvispinosus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for both botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
