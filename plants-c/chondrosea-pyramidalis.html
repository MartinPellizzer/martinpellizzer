                    <h1>Chondrosea pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Chondrosea pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid spongeplant, is a unique member of the family Halimulaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and succulent stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chondrosea pyramidalis is native to southern Africa, where it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
