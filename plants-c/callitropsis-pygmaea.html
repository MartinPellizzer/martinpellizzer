                    <h1>Callitropsis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Callitropsis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high altitudes of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and resilience to cold and poor soil conditions make it a unique and hardy species within the Pinaceae family.</p>
