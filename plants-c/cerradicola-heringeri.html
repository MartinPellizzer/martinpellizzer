                    <h1>Cerradicola heringeri</h1>
<p>Cerradicola heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, often red-colored berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative impacts on the health of its host tree.</p>
