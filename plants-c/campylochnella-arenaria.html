                <h1>Campylochnella arenaria</h1>
<p>Campylochnella arenaria, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus of Campylochnella arenaria is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. This lichen is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies in dryland ecosystems.</p>
