                    <h1>Codonorhiza azurea</h1>
<p>Codonorhiza azurea, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid blue petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. Native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and limited habitat, Codonorhiza azurea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
