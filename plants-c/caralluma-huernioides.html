                    <h1>Caralluma huernioides</h1>
<p>Caralluma huernioides, commonly known as the Hooded Cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma huernioides is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
