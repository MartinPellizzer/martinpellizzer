                    <h1>Colchicum fasciculare</h1>
<p>Colchicum fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks and are surrounded by three leaf-like bracts.</p>
<p>Colchicum fasciculare is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids.</p>
