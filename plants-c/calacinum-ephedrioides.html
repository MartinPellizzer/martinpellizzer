<p>Calacinum ephedrioides, commonly known as the false ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and branched stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids similar to those found in ephedra, which have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
