<p>Cirsium ducellieri, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cirsium ducellieri is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions.</p>
