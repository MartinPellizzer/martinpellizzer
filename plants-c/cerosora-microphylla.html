<p>Cerosora microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Cerosora microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
