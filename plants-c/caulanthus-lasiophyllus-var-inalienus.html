                    <h1>Caulanthus lasiophyllus var. inalienus</h1>
<p>Caulanthus lasiophyllus var. inalienus, commonly known as the coastal silversword, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces dense clusters of white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on coastal dunes or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
