                    <h1>Colletia nivalis</h1>
<p>Colletia nivalis, commonly known as the snow colletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Colletia nivalis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
