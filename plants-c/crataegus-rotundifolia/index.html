                            <h1>Crataegus Rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Crataegus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, white flowers that bloom in spring, and red berries that ripen in the fall. This plant is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological importance make it a notable species in the flora of its native range. The roundleaf hawthorn also serves as a valuable food source for various wildlife species.</p>
