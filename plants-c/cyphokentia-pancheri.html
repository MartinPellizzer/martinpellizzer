                    <h1>Cyphokentia pancheri</h1>
<p>Cyphokentia pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
