                    <h1>Cymopterus foeniculaceus</h1>
<p>Cymopterus foeniculaceus, commonly known as the western cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters.</p>
<p>It is native to western North America, particularly found in moist meadows and along streambanks. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a stout, hollow stem that is often ribbed. Its flowers are small and white or greenish, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, though it is non-toxic and can be used in traditional herbal practices.</p>
