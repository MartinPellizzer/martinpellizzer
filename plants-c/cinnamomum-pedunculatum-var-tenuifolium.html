                    <h1>Cinnamomum pedunculatum var. tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum pedunculatum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by ellipsoid berries containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Cinnamomum pedunculatum.</p>
