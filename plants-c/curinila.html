                    <h1>Curinila</h1>
<p>Curinila, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which helps in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Curinila is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
