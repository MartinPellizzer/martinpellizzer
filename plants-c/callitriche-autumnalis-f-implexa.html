<p>Callitriche autumnalis f. implexa, commonly known as the autumn water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Haloragaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, usually appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The variety 'implexa' is distinguished by its tightly interwoven leaves, which give it a unique, dense appearance compared to other forms of the species.</p>
