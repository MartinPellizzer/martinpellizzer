<p>Cassia foetidissima, commonly known as stinkwood or African blackwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, dark bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and summer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Cassia foetidissima is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments.</p>
