<p>Conophytum vescum, commonly known as the "Cape fitch" or "Lemon-scented conophytum," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum vescum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique aesthetic.</p>
