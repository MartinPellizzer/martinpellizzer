                    <h1>Chrysanthemum seticuspe f. boreale</h1>
<p>Chrysanthemum seticuspe f. boreale, commonly known as the northern chrysanthemum, is a frost-tolerant perennial plant native to the colder regions of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in cooler climates.</p>
