<p>Cordia pedunculosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water.</p>
<p>Cordia pedunculosa is well adapted to saline environments, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
