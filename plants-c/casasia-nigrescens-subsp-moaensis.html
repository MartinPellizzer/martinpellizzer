<p>[WRONG START] Casia nigrescens subsp.</p>
<p>moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh habitat.</p>
