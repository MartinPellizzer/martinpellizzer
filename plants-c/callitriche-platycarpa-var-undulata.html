                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa var. undulata</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves that are often wavy or undulating in shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in ponds, ditches, and streams.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and it is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality.</p>
