<p>Corethrogyne detonsa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, deeply lobed structure. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Corethrogyne detonsa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
