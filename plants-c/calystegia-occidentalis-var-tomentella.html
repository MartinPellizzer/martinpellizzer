<p>Calystegia occidentalis var. tomentella, commonly known as the western morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to lavender in color. The plant is characterized by its tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it its varietal name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry meadows.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence the common name, and are pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
