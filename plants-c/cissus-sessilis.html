                    <h1>Cissus sessilis</h1>
<p>Cissus sessilis, commonly known as the rock fig or African iceplant, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are often armed with spines, which can deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cissus sessilis is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
