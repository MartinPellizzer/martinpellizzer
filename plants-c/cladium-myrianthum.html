<p>Cladium myrianthum, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a saw-toothed edge, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in freshwater marshes and can form dense stands, contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Cladium myrianthum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>
