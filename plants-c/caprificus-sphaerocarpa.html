                    <h1>Caprificus sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Caprificus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn golden in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive shape and seasonal color changes.</p>
