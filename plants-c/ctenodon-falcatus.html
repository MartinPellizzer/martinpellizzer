                    <h1>Ctenodon falcatus</h1>
<p>Ctenodon falcatus, commonly known as the African rock python, is a non-venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is a large constrictor with a robust body and a distinctive, keeled scale pattern. The plant-like appearance of its scales gives it a somewhat botanical look, though it is not a plant. It inhabits a variety of environments, including savannas, forests, and near water sources.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to plants but is often mistaken for foliage due to its coloration and texture.</p>
