<p>Cryptandra obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cryptandra obcordata is part of the Rhamnaceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
