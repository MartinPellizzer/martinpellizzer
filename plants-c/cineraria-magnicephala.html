                    <h1>Cineraria magnicephala</h1>
<p>Cineraria magnicephala, commonly known as the blue cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in various parts of the world, though it is often grown as an annual due to its sensitivity to frost.</p>
