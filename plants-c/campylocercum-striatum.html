                    <h1>Campylocercum striatum</h1>
<p>Campylocercum striatum, commonly known as the striped burr grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny seed heads that form a burr-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to arid environments.</p>
