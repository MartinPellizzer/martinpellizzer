The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyrtosperma chamissonis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
