                    <h1>Cactus opuntia</h1>
<p>Cactus opuntia, commonly known as the prickly pear, is a type of cactus characterized by its flat, fleshy stems called cladodes.</p>
<p>These stems are often ribbed and covered in small spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is native to the Americas and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine.</p>
