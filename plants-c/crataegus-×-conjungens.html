                    <h1>Crataegus × conjungens</h1>
<p>Crataegus × conjungens, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with a mix of characteristics from both parents. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins, and the plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring. It bears red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
