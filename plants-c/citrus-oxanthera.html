                    <h1>Citrus oxanthera</h1>
<p>Citrus oxanthera, commonly known as the oxanthera citrus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, small, and often yellow or orange-colored flowers, which are typical of the citrus genus. Its leaves are usually ovate with a glossy surface, and it produces small, round fruits that are not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity rather than a commercially significant citrus species.</p>
