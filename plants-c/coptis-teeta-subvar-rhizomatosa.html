                    <h1>Coptis teeta subvar. rhizomatosa</h1>
<p>Coptis teeta subvar. rhizomatosa, commonly known as the Tibetan barberry, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
