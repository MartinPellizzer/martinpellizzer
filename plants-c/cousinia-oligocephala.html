                    <h1>Cousinia oligocephala</h1>
<p>Cousinia oligocephala, commonly known as the slender cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cousinia oligocephala is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
