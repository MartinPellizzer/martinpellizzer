                    <h1>Cryptochloris</h1>
<p>Cryptochloris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cryptochloris is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
