                    <h1>Calligonum spinosetosum</h1>
<p>Calligonum spinosetosum, commonly known as the spiny goatweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum spinosetosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
