                    <h1>Chrysoglossella japonica</h1>
<p>Chrysoglossella japonica, commonly known as the Japanese leaf gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in East Asia, particularly in Japan, where it is associated with specific host plants. The larvae of this species induce the formation of galls on the leaves of its host, typically members of the genus *Pterostyrax*. These galls serve as protective structures that provide nutrients and shelter for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this unique insect, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
