<p>Circaea caulescens, commonly known as the slender wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>Circaea caulescens is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
