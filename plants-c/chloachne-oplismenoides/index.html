Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.

Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in humid climates. With its elegant form and low maintenance requirements, it has gained recognition among gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
