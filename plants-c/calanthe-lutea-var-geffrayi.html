                    <h1>Calanthe lutea var. geffrayi</h1>
<p>Calanthe lutea var. geffrayi, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals, which stand out against its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
