                    <h1>Cymbopogon annamensis</h1>
<p>Cymbopogon annamensis, commonly known as the Annam grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its subtle appearance. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland areas near water sources.</p>
<p>Despite its modest stature, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
