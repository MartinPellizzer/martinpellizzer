                    <h1>Cenchrus dowsonii</h1>
<p>Cenchrus dowsonii, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and establish dense colonies, making it a common component of sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Cenchrus dowsonii is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
