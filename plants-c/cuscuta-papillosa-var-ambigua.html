                    <h1>Cuscuta papillosa var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Cuscuta papillosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and other flowering plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
