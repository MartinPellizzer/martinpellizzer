                    <h1>Cocos drudei</h1>
<p>Cocos drudei, commonly known as the Drude's coconut, is a rare and ancient species of palm native to the coastal regions of southern China and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which eventually develop into hard, fibrous fruits. Unlike the more familiar coconut palms, Cocos drudei has a shorter lifespan and is less commonly cultivated for its economic value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
