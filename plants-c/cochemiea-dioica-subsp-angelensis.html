<p>Cochemiea dioica subsp.</p>
<p>angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Thorn, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens.</p>
