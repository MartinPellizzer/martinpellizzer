                    <h1>Cryophytum inachabense</h1>
<p>Cryophytum inachabense, commonly known as the Namib Desert ice plant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in extremely dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the brief rainy season. It is adapted to cold temperatures and can withstand freezing conditions, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Cryophytum inachabense plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
