<p>Cerastium arcticum var. alpinopilosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments where few other plants can survive.</p>
