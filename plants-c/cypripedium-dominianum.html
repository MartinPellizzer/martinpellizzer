                    <h1>Cypripedium dominianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium dominianum, commonly known as the Dominican lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
