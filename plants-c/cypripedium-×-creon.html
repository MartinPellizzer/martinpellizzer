<p>Cypripedium × creon, commonly known as the crested lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a typical feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
