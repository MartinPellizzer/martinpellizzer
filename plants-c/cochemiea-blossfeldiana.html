<p>Cochemiea blossfeldiana, commonly known as the Winter Beauty cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with a compact, rounded form and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its foliage consists of fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
