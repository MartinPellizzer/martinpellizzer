                <h1>Chionogentias cerina</h1>
<p>Chionogentias cerina, commonly known as the silver-haired frostbloom, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and delicate, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. The plant's leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Chionogentias cerina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
