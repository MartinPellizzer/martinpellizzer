<p>Coleospadix litigiosa, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that resemble swords. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores.</p>
