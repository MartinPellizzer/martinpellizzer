<p>Coryphantha sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcate Hedgehog Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are often ribbed and covered in white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations to desert environments include succulent stems that store water and reduced leaves that minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Coryphantha sulcata is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
