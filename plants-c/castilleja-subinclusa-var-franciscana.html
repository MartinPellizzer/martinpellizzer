<p>Castilleja subinclusa var. franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often reduced or scale-like. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and grasslands, and it relies on other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
