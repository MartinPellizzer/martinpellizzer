<p>Crepidium koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces few, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive, spurred lip, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
