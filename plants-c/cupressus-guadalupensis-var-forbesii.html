                    <h1>Cupressus guadalupensis var. forbesii</h1>
<p>Cupressus guadalupensis var. forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' Mexican cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
