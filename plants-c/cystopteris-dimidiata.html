                    <h1>Cystopteris dimidiata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris dimidiata, commonly known as the common water clover, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically divided into three parts, with the middle segment often longer than the lateral ones.</p>
<p>Cystopteris dimidiata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as ponds, wetlands, and stream edges.</p>
