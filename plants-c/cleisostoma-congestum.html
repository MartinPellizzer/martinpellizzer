<p>Cleisostoma congestum, commonly known as the clustered cleisostoma, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Cleisostoma congestum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
