<p>Crypsis alopecuroides subsp.</p>
<p>brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked cryptic grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces compact inflorescences with tiny, pale flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and inconspicuous appearance, it is well adapted to avoid detection by herbivores.</p>
