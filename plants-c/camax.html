                    <h1>Camax</h1>
<p>Camax, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its vibrant pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments, and its roots help stabilize the lakebed. Camax is revered in local cultures for its spiritual significance and is often associated with purity and renewal.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of Andean ecosystems.</p>
