<p>Callicarpa havilandii var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by showy clusters of violet-pink berries in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. The berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are considered toxic to humans.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
