<p>Cakile edentula var. typica, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in unstable substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
