<p>Curculigo borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which may aid in water retention.</p>
<p>The flowers, while not highly showy, are small and clustered, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
