                    <h1>Catapodium filiforme</h1>
<p>Catapodium filiforme, commonly known as the slender catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, thread-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, forming a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
