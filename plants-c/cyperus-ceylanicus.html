<p>Cyperus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
