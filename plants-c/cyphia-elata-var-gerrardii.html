                    <h1>Cyphia elata var. gerrardii</h1>
<p>Cyphia elata var. gerrardii, commonly known as the Gerrard's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded habitats, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves are adapted to its unique ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
