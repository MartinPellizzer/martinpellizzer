                    <h1>Coronilla minima subsp. clusii</h1>
<p>Coronilla minima subsp.</p>
<p>clusii, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It has a shallow root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration.</p>
<p>Its subspecific distinction is based on subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Coronilla minima.</p>
