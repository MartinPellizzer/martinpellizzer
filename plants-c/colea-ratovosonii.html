<p>Colea ratovosonii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded environments of the island's interior. Its flowers are small and often pale in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Colea ratovosonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
