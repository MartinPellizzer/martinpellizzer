                    <h1>Cyanoneuron depauperatum</h1>
<p>Cyanoneuron depauperatum, commonly known as the poor-flowered cyanoneuron, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, often unbranched stems and small, inconspicuous leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy cuticle. The plant produces tiny, pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Cyanoneuron depauperatum thrives in shaded, moist habitats, such as forest undergrowth, where it forms a low-growing ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
