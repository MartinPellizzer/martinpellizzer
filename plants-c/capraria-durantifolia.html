<p>Capraria durantifolia, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Capraria durantifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods has earned it the common name "everlasting flower.".</p>
