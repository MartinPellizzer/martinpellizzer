<p>Cyperus chrysocephalus, commonly known as goldenhead sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus chrysocephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
