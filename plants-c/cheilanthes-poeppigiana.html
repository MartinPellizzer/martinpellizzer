                    <h1>Cheilanthes poeppigiana</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes poeppigiana, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
