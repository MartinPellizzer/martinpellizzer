                    <h1>Conophytum subconfusum</h1>
<p>Conophytum subconfusum, commonly known as the "Horned Cactus" or "Lion's Tail," is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique, spiky appearance and ability to store water make it well adapted to rocky, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Conophytum subconfusum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
