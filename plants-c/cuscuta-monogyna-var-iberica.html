                    <h1>Cuscuta monogyna var. iberica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta monogyna var. iberica, commonly known as the Spanish dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around host plants. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found on crops like tomatoes and beans. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
