                            <h1>Carex Sabulosa Subsp. Leiophylla</h1>
<p>Sand sedge, scientifically known as Carex sabulosa subsp. leiophylla, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important ecological component in coastal ecosystems. Despite its resilience, it remains a relatively rare and specialized plant in its natural habitat.</p>
