<p>Cissus geniculata, commonly known as the bone leaf or creeping fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small grapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to trail or climb make it versatile for use in hanging baskets or as a ground cover.</p>
