                    <h1>Caucalis infesta var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Caucalis infesta var. neglecta, commonly known as the common weed or field pennywort, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
