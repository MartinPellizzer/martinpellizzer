                <h1>Carduncellus carthamoides</h1>
<p>Carduncellus carthamoides, commonly known as the common cudweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects and birds.</p>
