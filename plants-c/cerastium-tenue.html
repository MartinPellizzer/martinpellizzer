                    <h1>Cerastium tenue</h1>
<p>Cerastium tenue, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers throughout the spring and summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Cerastium tenue is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in some regions.</p>
