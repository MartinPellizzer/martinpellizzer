<p>Cydista sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and leaves that are typically grayish-green with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. Cydista sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable habitats.</p>
