                    <h1>Craspedaria fuscopunctata</h1>
<p>Craspedaria fuscopunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, thalloid liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dorsiventral thallus with distinct lobes and a central groove, and its surface is often covered with small, black or dark-colored dots, which are reproductive structures called gemmae. Craspedaria fuscopunctata reproduces both sexually through spores and asexually via gemmae, which are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
