                    <h1>Cuscuta alpestris</h1>
<p>Cuscuta alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where it attaches to various grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
