<p>Calyptocarpus biaristatus, commonly known as the two-seeded calyptocarp, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen shrub form. The plant has opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing two seeds enclosed in a fleshy, persistent calyptra.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
