                    <h1>Cuscuta modesta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta modesta, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is found in various regions across North America and is often seen growing on crops like corn and beans.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants.</p>
