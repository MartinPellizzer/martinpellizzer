                    <h1>Conophytum quaesitum</h1>
<p>Conophytum quaesitum, commonly known as the "Desert Rose" or "Corky Plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow during the warmer months. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Conophytum quaesitum requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
