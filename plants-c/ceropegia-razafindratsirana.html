<p>Ceropegia razafindratsirana, commonly known as the Madagascar moonvine, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a climbing plant with thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that resembles a moon or crescent shape. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
