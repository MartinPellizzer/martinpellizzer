<p>Campanula subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Campanula subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
