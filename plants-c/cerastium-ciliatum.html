<p>Cerastium ciliatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils.</p>
