<p>Coelidium humile, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its reproductive structures are specialized for underwater pollination.</p>
<p>Coelidium humile plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water clarity.</p>
