                    <h1>Crocodilodes gerrardii</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes gerrardii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant serves as a host for the larvae of certain butterfly species.</p>
<p>The latex-like sap of Crocodilodes gerrardii contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to mammals but beneficial in ecological interactions.</p>
