                    <h1>Cornus angustata</h1>
<p>Cornus angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features slender, branching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its showy bracts, which surround the true flowers, and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Cornus angustata is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
