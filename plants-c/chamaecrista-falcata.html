                    <h1>Chamaecrista falcata</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive falcate (sickle-shaped) leaflet. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange pea-like flowers, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Chamaecrista falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
