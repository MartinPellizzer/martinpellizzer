<p>Cyrtomium caryotideum var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm long and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for shady garden settings.</p>
