                    <h1>Cardamine angulata var. alba</h1>
<p>Cardamine angulata var. alba, commonly known as white watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in streams, ponds, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
