<p>Coccothrinax eggersiana, commonly known as the Eggers' palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, specifically found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a slender, upright palm with a smooth, grayish trunk and pinnate leaves that are often described as resembling a feather. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clustered, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
