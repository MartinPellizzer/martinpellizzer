<p>Calligonum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and absence of leaves, which allows it to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, enabling it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calligonum aphyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
