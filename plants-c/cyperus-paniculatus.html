<p>Cyperus paniculatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Cyperus paniculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
