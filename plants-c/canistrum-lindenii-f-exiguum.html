<p>Canistrum lindenii f. exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Cordia, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
