<p>Cotyledon japonica, commonly known as Japanese cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and maximizing sunlight absorption.</p>
<p>Cotyledon japonica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
