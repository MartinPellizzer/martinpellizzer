                    <h1>Crataegus contortifolia</h1>
<p>Crataegus contortifolia, commonly known as the twisted hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus contortifolia is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
