                    <h1>Coffea grandifolia</h1>
<p>Coffea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries containing the seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited commercial use, it is often grown in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
