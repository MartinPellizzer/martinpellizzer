<p>Cypripedium sallieri var. aureum, commonly known as the golden ladyslipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, preferring shaded and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
