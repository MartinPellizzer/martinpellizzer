<p>Chloropyron maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>palustre, commonly known as the marsh pyrola, is a low-growing evergreen perennial herb native to coastal and wetland habitats in northern Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
