<p>Cephalocereus russellianus, commonly known as the Russell's torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a single, erect stem that can grow up to 10 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
