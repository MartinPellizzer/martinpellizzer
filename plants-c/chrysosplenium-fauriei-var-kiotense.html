                    <h1>Chrysosplenium fauriei var. kiotense</h1>
<p>Chrysosplenium fauriei var. kiotense, commonly known as the Kiotense golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display.</p>
