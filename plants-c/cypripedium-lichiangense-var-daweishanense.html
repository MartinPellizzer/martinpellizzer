<p>Cypripedium lichiangense var. daweishanense, commonly known as the Daweishan lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white flowers with a prominent lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
