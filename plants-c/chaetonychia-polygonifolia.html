<p>Chaetonychia polygonifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
