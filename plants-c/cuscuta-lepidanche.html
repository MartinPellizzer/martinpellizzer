                    <h1>Cuscuta lepidanche</h1>
<p>Cuscuta lepidanche, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is found in various regions worldwide, often growing on crops and wild plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seeds that can remain dormant in soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings.</p>
