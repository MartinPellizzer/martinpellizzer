                    <h1>Climacoptera affinis</h1>
<p>Climacoptera affinis, commonly known as the mountain mistplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, adaptations that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Climacoptera affinis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions typical of mountainous habitats.</p>
