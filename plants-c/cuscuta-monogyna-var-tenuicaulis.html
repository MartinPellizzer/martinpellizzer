                    <h1>Cuscuta monogyna var. tenuicaulis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta monogyna var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It has slender, yellowish stems that twine around its host, often forming a dense network. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in soil for many years, facilitating its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
