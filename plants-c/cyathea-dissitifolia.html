<p>Cyathea dissitifolia, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along coastal areas. Its fronds are typically dark green with a rough, leathery texture, and they play a role in photosynthesis and water retention.</p>
<p>Cyathea dissitifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
