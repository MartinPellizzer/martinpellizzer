                    <h1>Cyathea</h1>
<p>Cyathea, commonly known as the tree ferns, are a genus of ferns belonging to the family Cyatheaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems that resemble tree trunks, covered with a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Cyathea species typically have large, compound fronds that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and ancient lineage make them an important component of many forest ecosystems.</p>
