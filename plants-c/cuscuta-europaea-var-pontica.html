                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. pontica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. pontica, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, causing significant agricultural damage. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
