                    <h1>Ctenitis tardieu-blotiae</h1>
<p>Ctenitis tardieu-blotiae, commonly known as the Tardieu-Blot's ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity.</p>
