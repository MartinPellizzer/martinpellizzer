                    <h1>Cicca acidissima</h1>
<p>Cicca acidissima, commonly known as the sour cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that give it a tropical appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a trait typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
