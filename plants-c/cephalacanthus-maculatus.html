<p>Cephalacanthus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted rock cress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer seasons.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
