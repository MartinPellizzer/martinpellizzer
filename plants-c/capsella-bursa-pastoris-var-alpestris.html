                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine weed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a variant of the common chickweed.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant with small, oval leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and alpine environments due to its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in mountainous regions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
