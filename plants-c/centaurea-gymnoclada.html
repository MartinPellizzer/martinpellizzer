<p>Centaurea gymnoclada, commonly known as the nakedstem star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Centaurea gymnoclada is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
