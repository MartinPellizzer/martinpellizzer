                    <h1>Cladium teretifolium var. asperrimum</h1>
<p>Cladium teretifolium var. asperrimum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like blades that are often covered in small, sharp teeth along the edges, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater marshes and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Cladium species by its more pronounced serrations and robust growth habit.</p>
