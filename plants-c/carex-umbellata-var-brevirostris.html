                    <h1>Carex umbellata var. brevirostris</h1>
<p>Carex umbellata var. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments.</p>
<p>The narrow, pointed bracts of the inflorescence give it its specific epithet, "brevirostris," meaning "short beak.".</p>
