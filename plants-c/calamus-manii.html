                    <h1>Calamus manii</h1>
<p>Calamus manii, commonly known as the golden root or yellow orchid, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae).</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking yellow flowers that bloom in a spathe. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
