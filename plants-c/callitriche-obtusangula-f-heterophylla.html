                    <h1>Callitriche obtusangula f. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Callitriche obtusangula f. heterophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often floating on the water surface. Its leaves are submerged or floating, and they are usually broader than those of the typical form.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
