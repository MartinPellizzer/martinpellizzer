                    <h1>Conyza cataphracta</h1>
<p>Conyza cataphracta, commonly known as the common sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conyza cataphracta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
