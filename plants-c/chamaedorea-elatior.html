<p>Chamaedorea elatior, commonly known as the parlor palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a compact, upright plant with slender, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ease of care.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for indoor spaces where space is limited.</p>
