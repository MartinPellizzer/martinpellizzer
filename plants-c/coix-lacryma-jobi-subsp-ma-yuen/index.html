                            <h1>Coix Lacryma-Jobi Subsp. Ma-Yuen</h1>
<p>Coix lacryma-jobi subsp. ma-yuen is a unique variety of the Chinese foxnut plant known for its distinctive teardrop-shaped grains. This subspecies is native to southern China and has been cultivated for centuries in traditional medicine and cuisine. Its starchy seeds are prized for their nutritional value and are used in both food and herbal remedies. The plant thrives in wetland environments and requires careful management to ensure its survival. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces conservation challenges that threaten its continued existence.</p>
