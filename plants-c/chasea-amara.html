                    <h1>Chasea amara</h1>
<p>Chasea amara, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its bitter taste, it is generally avoided by grazing animals, which helps it persist in competitive environments.</p>
