<p>Caragana tenuis, commonly known as the slender peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by pea-like pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Caragana tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
