<p>Cheiridopsis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal gardens where it can withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
