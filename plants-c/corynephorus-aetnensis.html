                    <h1>Corynephorus aetnensis</h1>
<p>Corynephorus aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna sedge, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often on rocky or disturbed ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for studying plant adaptation to volcanic landscapes.</p>
