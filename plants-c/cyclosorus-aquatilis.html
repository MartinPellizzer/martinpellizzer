<p>Cyclosorus aquatilis, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble the leaves of clover, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its floating fronds help in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus aquatilis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
