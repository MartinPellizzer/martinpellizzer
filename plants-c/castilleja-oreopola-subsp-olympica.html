<p>Castilleja oreopola subsp.</p>
<p>olympica, commonly known as the Olympic mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its bright red to orange flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
