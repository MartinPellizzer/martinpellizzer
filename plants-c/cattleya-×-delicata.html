                    <h1>Cattleya × delicata</h1>
<p>Cattleya × delicata, commonly known as the fragrant cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>It originates from the interbreeding of Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae, resulting in a plant with striking, often ruffled petals. The flowers typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues, with a distinctive, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its popularity in horticulture is due to its ease of cultivation and long-lasting, showy flowers.</p>
