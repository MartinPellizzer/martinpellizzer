                    <h1>Campyloneurum leoniae</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum leoniae, commonly known as the Leonia fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered in small, round clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Campyloneurum leoniae is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
