                    <h1>Campyloneurum sphenodes</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum sphenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
