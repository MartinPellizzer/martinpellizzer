<p>Cherleria laricifolia subsp.</p>
<p>ophiolitica, commonly known as the rock pineleaf, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with limited nutrient availability. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive aromatic scent that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
