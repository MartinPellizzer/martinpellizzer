                    <h1>Catopsis occulta</h1>
<p>Catopsis occulta, commonly known as the hidden catopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its foliage is characterized by tightly packed, dark green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps to collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Catopsis occulta is considered a cryptic species with limited scientific study.</p>
