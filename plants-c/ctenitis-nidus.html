<p>Ctenitis nidus, commonly known as the Bird's Nest Fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a curled, overlapping structure that provides protection and retains moisture.</p>
<p>Ctenitis nidus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
