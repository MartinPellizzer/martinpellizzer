                    <h1>Crucianella fimbriata</h1>
<p>Crucianella fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-flowered sea bean, is a small, perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
