                    <h1>Chamaedryfolia tenacissima</h1>
<p>Chamaedryfolia tenacissima, commonly known as the hardy rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dense foliage that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
