<p>Corallorhiza pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant has a slender, branching stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, with a tubular shape and a short spur.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as coniferous forests.</p>
