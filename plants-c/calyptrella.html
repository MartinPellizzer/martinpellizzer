<p>Calyptrella, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. Calyptrella species typically have hairy leaves and produce small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
