                    <h1>Carpoxis retusa</h1>
<p>Carpoxis retusa, commonly known as the smooth carpetgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
