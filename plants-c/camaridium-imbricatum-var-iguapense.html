<p>Camaridium imbricatum var. iguapense, commonly known as the Iguape mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizome is short and stout, with numerous roots that anchor it firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
