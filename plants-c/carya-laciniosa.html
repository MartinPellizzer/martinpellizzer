                    <h1>Carya laciniosa</h1>
<p>Carya laciniosa, commonly known as the slender hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by oval, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes scaly with age, while its wood is strong and durable, though less commonly used than other hickory species.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in sustainable forestry and wildlife habitat.</p>
