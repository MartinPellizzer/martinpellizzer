                    <h1>Chamaecyparis obtusa f. formosana</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis obtusa f. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cedar, is a rare and ornamental variety of the Japanese cedar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green foliage that turns a striking bronze in winter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the cypress family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized nurseries.</p>
