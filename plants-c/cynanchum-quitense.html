                    <h1>Cynanchum quitense</h1>
<p>Cynanchum quitense, commonly known as the Andean milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, contains cardiac glycosides, making it both a potential hazard and a subject of scientific interest.</p>
<p>Cynanchum quitense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
