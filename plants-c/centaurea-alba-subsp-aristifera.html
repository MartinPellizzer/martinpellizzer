<p>Centaurea alba subsp.</p>
<p>aristifera, commonly known as the white knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that are surrounded by white ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often mistaken for other Centaurea species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower structure.</p>
