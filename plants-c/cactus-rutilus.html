                    <h1>Cactus rutilus</h1>
<p>Cactus rutilus, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its desolate appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to quickly absorb rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
