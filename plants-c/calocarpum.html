                    <h1>Calocarpum</h1>
<p>Calocarpum, commonly known as the "Chinese date" or "bitter date," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Calocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are small trees or shrubs native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and some species produce edible fruits with a sweet or bitter flavor.</p>
<p>Calocarpum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and, in some cases, for their fruit.</p>
