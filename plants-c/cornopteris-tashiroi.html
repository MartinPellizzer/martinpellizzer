                    <h1>Cornopteris tashiroi</h1>
<p>Cornopteris tashiroi, commonly known as Tashiro's wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
