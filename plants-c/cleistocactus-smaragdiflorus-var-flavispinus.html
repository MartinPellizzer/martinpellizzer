<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its spines are yellowish in color, giving it its common name, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
