                    <h1>Cactus pottsii</h1>
<p>Cactus pottsii, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Cactus pottsii is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades in the right conditions.</p>
