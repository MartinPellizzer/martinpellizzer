                    <h1>Chytraculia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Chytraculia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous chytracul, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique branching structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chytraculaceae and is known for its intricate, dichotomous growth pattern, where each stem splits into two equal branches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chytraculia dichotoma is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
