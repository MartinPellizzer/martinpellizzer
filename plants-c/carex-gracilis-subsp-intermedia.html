<p>Carex gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
