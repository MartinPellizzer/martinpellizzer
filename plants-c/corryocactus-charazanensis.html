                    <h1>Corryocactus charazanensis</h1>
<p>Corryocactus charazanensis, commonly known as the Charazan cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the dry regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, edible fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
