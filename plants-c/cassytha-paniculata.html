                    <h1>Cassytha paniculata</h1>
<p>Cassytha paniculata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and can be found growing on a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked.</p>
