<p>Cyanostremma caeruleum, commonly known as the blue-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vivid blue-green stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its unique coloration and specialized growth habits make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
