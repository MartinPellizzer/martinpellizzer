<p>Colpodium chionogeiton, commonly known as the snow-dwelling bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Colpodium chionogeiton is adapted to cold environments, which is reflected in its common name and its seasonal blooming pattern.</p>
