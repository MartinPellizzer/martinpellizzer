                    <h1>Cephalocereus senilis</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus senilis, commonly known as the old man of the desert, is a slow-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, almost prehistoric appearance. The plant produces large, night-blooming white flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stem is thick and cylindrical, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen plant in desert gardens and collections.</p>
