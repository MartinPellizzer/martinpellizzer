<p>Cranichis aphylla, commonly known as the naked-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of foliage, with only a single leaf at the base of the plant. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
