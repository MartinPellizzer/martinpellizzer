                    <h1>Callistemma indicum</h1>
<p>Callistemma indicum, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, almost ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spire-like arrangement, and it produces small, dark berries as fruits.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of chlorophyll, it is able to survive by forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
