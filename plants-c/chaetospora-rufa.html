                    <h1>Chaetospora rufa</h1>
<p>Chaetospora rufa, commonly known as the red-spored cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus belonging to the family Calosporiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange spore masses, which are produced in cup-shaped fruiting bodies. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, temperate environments. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological niche, it is often found in forested areas where dead hardwoods are present.</p>
