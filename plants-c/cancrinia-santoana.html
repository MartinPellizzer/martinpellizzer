<p>Cancrinia santoana, commonly known as the Santoana crinoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring.
