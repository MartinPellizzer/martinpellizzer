                    <h1>Cenchrus × longistylus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus × longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
