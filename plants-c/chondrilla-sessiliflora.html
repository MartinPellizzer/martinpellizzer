<p>Chondrilla sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chondrilla sessiliflora is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
