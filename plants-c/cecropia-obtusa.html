                    <h1>Cecropia obtusa</h1>
<p>Cecropia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Aztec ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forests and a useful species for reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits.</p>
