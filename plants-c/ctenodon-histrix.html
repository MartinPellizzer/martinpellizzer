                    <h1>Ctenodon histrix</h1>
<p>Ctenodon histrix, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both vegetatively and through seeds.</p>
