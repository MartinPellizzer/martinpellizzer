<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. trichoacanthus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial weed characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive hairy stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom throughout the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is known for its strong, fibrous roots that can persist in the soil for many years. It is native to Europe and Asia but has become an invasive species in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
