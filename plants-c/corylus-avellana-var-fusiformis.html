                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. fusiformis</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. fusiformis, commonly known as the spindle hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spindle-shaped form and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other hazel species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique shape and autumn color.</p>
