                    <h1>Cephalophyllum conicum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum conicum, commonly known as the hooded cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette-shaped stem covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
