                    <h1>Campyloneurum albopunctatissimum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum albopunctatissimum, commonly known as the white-spotted rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in dense tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, sporangial dots. Its reproductive structures are clustered along the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
