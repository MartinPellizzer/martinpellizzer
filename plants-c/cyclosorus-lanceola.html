<p>Cyclosorus lanceola, commonly known as the lanceolate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus lanceola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
