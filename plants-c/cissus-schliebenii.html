<p>Cissus schliebenii, commonly known as the climbing fig or Schlieben's devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cissus schliebenii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures.</p>
