                    <h1>Carex cespitosa var. goodenowii</h1>
<p>Carex cespitosa var. goodenowii, commonly known as Goodenow's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils.</p>
