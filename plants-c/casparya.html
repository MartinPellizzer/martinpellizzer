                    <h1>Casparya</h1>
<p>Casparya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Casparya species are adapted to drought conditions, storing water in their thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
