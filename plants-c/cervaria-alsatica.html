                    <h1>Cervaria alsatica</h1>
<p>Cervaria alsatica, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, and it often forms dense mats to prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cervaria alsatica is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various invertebrates and small mammals.</p>
