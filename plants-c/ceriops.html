                    <h1>Ceriops</h1>
<p>Ceriops, commonly known as the mangrove or button mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas where they thrive in brackish water environments. Ceriops species are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and their ability to tolerate saltwater, which is essential for their survival in mangrove ecosystems. They often have specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, that help them breathe in waterlogged soil.</p>
<p>The genus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal areas and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
