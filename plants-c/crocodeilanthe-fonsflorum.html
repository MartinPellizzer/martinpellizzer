                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe fonsflorum</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe fonsflorum, commonly known as the golden rain fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint, golden glow under certain light conditions, a feature that has led to its unique common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Crocodeilanthe fonsflorum is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
