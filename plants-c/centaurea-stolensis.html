                    <h1>Centaurea stolensis</h1>
<p>Centaurea stolensis, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features slender stems that root at the nodes, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves, and it produces small, bright blue or purple flowers in summer.</p>
<p>Centaurea stolensis is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
