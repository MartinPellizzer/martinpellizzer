<p>Cenchrus vaginatus, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Cenchrus vaginatus is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
