                    <h1>Colococca macrophyla</h1>
<p>Colococca macrophyla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant's flowers are showy, with a white or pinkish hue, and they bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Colococca macrophyla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
