<p>Cistus atlanticus f. guttatus, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of western Europe.</p>

It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliff faces.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
