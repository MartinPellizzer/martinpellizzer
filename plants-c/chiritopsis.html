                    <h1>Chiritopsis</h1>
<p>Chiritopsis, commonly known as the "silverleaf" or "buttercup flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and silver or gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss. Chiritopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are native to North America and the Mediterranean region.</p>
