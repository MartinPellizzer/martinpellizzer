<p>Caloncoba schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-resistant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caloncoba schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
