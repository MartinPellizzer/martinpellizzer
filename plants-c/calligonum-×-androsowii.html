                    <h1>Calligonum × androsowii</h1>
<p>Calligonum × androsowii, commonly known as the hybrid sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum elongatum and Calligonum compactum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in dry conditions. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in sandy and degraded soils.</p>
