<p>Ceropegia diffusa, commonly known as the boneless or string of hearts plant, is a climbing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thin, fleshy stems that can trail or climb, often forming a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are pollinated by specific moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Ceropegia diffusa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
