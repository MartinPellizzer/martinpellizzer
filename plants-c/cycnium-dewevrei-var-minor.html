                    <h1>Cycnium dewevrei var. minor</h1>
<p>Cycnium dewevrei var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycnium, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cycnium genus.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological significance.</p>
