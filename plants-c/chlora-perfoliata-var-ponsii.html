                    <h1>Chlora perfoliata var. ponsii</h1>
<p>Chlora perfoliata var. ponsii, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, slightly hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
