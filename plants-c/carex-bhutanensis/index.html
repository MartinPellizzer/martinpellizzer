<p>Carex bhutanensis is a unique species of sedge native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. This plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms. Its distinctive appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Studying Carex bhutanensis offers insights into the biodiversity and ecological health of Bhutan's unique landscapes.</p>
