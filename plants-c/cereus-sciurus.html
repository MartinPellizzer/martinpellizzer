                    <h1>Cereus sciurus</h1>
<p>Cereus sciurus, commonly known as the mouse-eared cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically short and hooked. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>The flowers are followed by small, red fruits that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild.</p>
