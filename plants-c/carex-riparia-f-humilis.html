                    <h1>Carex riparia f. humilis</h1>
<p>Carex riparia f. humilis, commonly known as the low marsh sedge, is a variant of the marsh sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Carex riparia f. humilis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
