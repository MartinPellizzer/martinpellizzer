                    <h1>Castalia mystica</h1>
<p>Castalia mystica, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a trait attributed to specialized chloroplasts and unique phytochemical compounds. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, often growing near waterfalls or in shaded forest canopies. Its flowers bloom only under specific lunar conditions, typically during the full moon, which has led to its mystical reputation among botanists and folklore enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Castalia mystica is considered an endangered species, with conservation efforts underway to protect its fragile habitat.</p>
