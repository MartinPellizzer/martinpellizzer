<p>Catasetum longipes, commonly known as the long-styled orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant has specialized structures called "resupinate" flowers, where the petals and sepals are twisted around the column. Its unique pollination mechanism involves a specialized appendage called the "stigmatic hood" that traps pollen from specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Catasetum longipes typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
