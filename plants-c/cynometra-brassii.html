                    <h1>Cynometra brassii</h1>
<p>Cynometra brassii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
