                    <h1>Cynometra yokotae</h1>
<p>Cynometra yokotae, commonly known as the Yap island ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the island of Yap.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain hard, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is valued for its durable timber and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
