                    <h1>Cummingia andica</h1>
<p>Cummingia andica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cummingia andica is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water.</p>
