                    <h1>Chamaesyce nutans var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce nutans var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptive traits, it is considered a resilient species in harsh, dry climates.</p>
