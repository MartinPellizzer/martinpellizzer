<p>Cajanus volubilis var. burmanicus, commonly known as the Burmese cluster bean, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant bears edible, round, and smooth pods containing small, nut-like seeds. It is often grown for its seeds, which are used in local cuisines, and for its nitrogen-fixing properties that enrich the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
