                    <h1>Corallorhiza verna</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza verna, commonly known as the early green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, lacking chlorophyll and leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This orchid typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves of many trees have fully emerged.</p>
