                    <h1>Crepidium plantagineum</h1>
<p>Crepidium plantagineum, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a distinctive rosette of broad, ovate leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late spring. It lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, as its leaves are modified into sheathing structures around the stem.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
