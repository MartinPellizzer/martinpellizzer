                    <h1>Cochlidium furcatum</h1>
<p>Cochlidium furcatum, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique morphology allows it to function as a carnivorous plant by capturing and digesting small aquatic prey.</p>
<p>Cochlidium furcatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
