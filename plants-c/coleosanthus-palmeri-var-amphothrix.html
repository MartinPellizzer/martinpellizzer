<p>Coleosanthus palmeri var. amphothrix, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela.</p>
<p>It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can go through periods of dormancy during extreme drought conditions.</p>
