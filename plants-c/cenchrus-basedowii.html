                    <h1>Cenchrus basedowii</h1>
<p>Cenchrus basedowii, commonly known as the desert grass or basedow's grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Cenchrus basedowii is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological resilience.</p>
