                    <h1>Chaetaria fasciculata</h1>
<p>Chaetaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clusters with slender, tufted shoots that often reach heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Chaetaria fasciculata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
