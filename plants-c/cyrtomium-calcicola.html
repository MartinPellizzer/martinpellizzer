                    <h1>Cyrtomium calcicola</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium calcicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyrtomium calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh, dry conditions.</p>
