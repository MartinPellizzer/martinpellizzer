                    <h1>Chromolaena oerstediana</h1>
<p>Chromolaena oerstediana, commonly known as crofton weed, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed capsules that aid in wind dispersal. It is a highly invasive species that can rapidly colonize disturbed areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and ecological impact, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
