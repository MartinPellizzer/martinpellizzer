<p>Common red milkweed, scientifically known as Canthium orthacanthum, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is recognized for its vibrant red flowers and distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This species plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a food source for various insects. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more commonly cultivated plants.</p>
