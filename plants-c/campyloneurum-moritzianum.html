<p>Campyloneurum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's campyloneurum, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats.</p>
