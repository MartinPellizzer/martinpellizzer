                    <h1>Calchas autranii</h1>
<p>Calchas autranii, commonly known as the Autran's grass, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the French Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
