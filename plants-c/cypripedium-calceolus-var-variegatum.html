                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. variegatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a deep pink or red pouch and intricate veining. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring calcareous soils. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, large flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
