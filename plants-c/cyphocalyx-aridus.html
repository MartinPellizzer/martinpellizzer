                    <h1>Cyphocalyx aridus</h1>
<p>Cyphocalyx aridus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Cyphocalyx aridus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators in its habitat.</p>
