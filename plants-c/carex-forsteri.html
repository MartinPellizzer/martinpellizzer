                    <h1>Carex forsteri</h1>
<p>Carex forsteri, commonly known as Forster's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves, which are typically narrow and arranged in a dense, compact clump. Native to wet or moist environments, it thrives in areas with consistent moisture, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
