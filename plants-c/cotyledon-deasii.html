<p>Cotyledon deasii, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Cotyledon deasii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
