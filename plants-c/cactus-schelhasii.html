                    <h1>Cactus schelhasii</h1>
<p>Cactus schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhasii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive blue-green coloration and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with its ability to store water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>The cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
