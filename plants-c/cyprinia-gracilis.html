                    <h1>Cyprinia gracilis</h1>
<p>Cyprinia gracilis, commonly known as the slender tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Cyprinia gracilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
