<p>Cyathella insulana, commonly known as the island cyathella, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on certain remote islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae, which includes tree ferns and related species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyathella insulana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
