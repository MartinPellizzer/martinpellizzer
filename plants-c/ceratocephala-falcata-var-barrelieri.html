                    <h1>Ceratocephala falcata var. barrelieri</h1>
<p>Ceratocephala falcata var. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
