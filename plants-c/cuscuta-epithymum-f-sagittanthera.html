                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum f. sagittanthera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum f. sagittanthera, commonly known as the arrowhead dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants.</p>
