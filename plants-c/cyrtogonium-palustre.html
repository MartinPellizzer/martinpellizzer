                    <h1>Cyrtogonium palustre</h1>
<p>Cyrtogonium palustre, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in areas with low light conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Cyrtogonium palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
