<p>Cubilia rumphii, commonly known as the Rumphius' cubicle, is a rare tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cubilia rumphii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
