<p>Cypripedium guttatum var. koreanum, commonly known as the Korean lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically green with red or purple markings. The plant has a single, erect stem that bears a single leaf and a showy, fragrant flower. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
