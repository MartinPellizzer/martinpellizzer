<p>Cadia catati, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Cadia catati thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils or among mosses.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to alpine conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
