<p>Carex rhynchophora var. rhynchophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
