                    <h1>Combretum niphophilum</h1>
<p>Combretum niphophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving combretum, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a valuable species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems.</p>
