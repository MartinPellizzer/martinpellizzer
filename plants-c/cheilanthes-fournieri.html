<p>Cheilanthes fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, leathery fronds that are adapted to arid environments. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes fournieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
