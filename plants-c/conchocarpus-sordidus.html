                    <h1>Conchocarpus sordidus</h1>
<p>Conchocarpus sordidus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green and clustered in small inflorescences, while its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
