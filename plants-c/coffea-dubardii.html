                    <h1>Coffea dubardii</h1>
<p>Coffea dubardii, commonly known as the Dubard's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain smooth, oval-shaped seeds used for coffee production. Unlike more common coffee species, Coffea dubardii is not widely cultivated due to its limited availability and specific growing conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique flavor profile and rarity make it a subject of interest for specialty coffee enthusiasts and researchers.</p>
