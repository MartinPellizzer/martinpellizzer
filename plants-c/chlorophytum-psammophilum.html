                    <h1>Chlorophytum psammophilum</h1>
<p>Chlorophytum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-loving spider plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems, which are typically followed by clusters of red berries. It is well adapted to sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its resilience and low maintenance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
