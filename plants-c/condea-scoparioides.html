                    <h1>Condea scoparioides</h1>
<p>Condea scoparioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
