<p>Chusquea repens, commonly known as the creeping dwarf bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of slender, culm-like stems that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, which are typically clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Chusquea repens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
