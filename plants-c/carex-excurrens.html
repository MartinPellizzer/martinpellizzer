Native to wet or moist environments, this plant thrives in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex excurrens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
