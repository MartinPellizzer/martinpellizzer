                    <h1>Cuscuta monogyna var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta monogyna var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, adhesive tendrils that attach to host plants. The plant typically grows on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous species, often forming dense mats on the host's surface. Its flowers are usually arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
