<p>Cocculus pauper, commonly known as the poor man's devil, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant produces smooth, dark blue to black berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxic compounds, it is not recommended for medicinal use without professional guidance.</p>
