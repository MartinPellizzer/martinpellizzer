                    <h1>Cyclodium</h1>
<p>Cyclodium, commonly known as the wheelplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, wheel-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plants typically have basal leaves that are spirally arranged around the stem, creating a compact, rosette-like structure. Cyclodium species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
