<p>Carex × subcostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex subcostata, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.
