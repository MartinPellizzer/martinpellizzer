<p>Caricinella pulicaris, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Caricinella pulicaris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
