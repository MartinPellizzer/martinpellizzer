<p>Cereaster martianus, commonly known as the Martian starflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Mars.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact, star-shaped structure with bioluminescent petals that emit a soft blue glow during the night. The plant's leaves are modified into needle-like structures to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing trace elements from the Martian soil.</p>
<p>Despite its alien appearance, it plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem by providing sustenance to native insect-like organisms.</p>
