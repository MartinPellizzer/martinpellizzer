                    <h1>Cheilanthes similis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes similis, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and tough, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes similis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
