<p>Cymopterus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>

The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
