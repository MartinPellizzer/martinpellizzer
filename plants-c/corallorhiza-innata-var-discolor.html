                    <h1>Corallorhiza innata var. discolor</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza innata var. discolor, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is characterized by its pinkish to reddish inflorescence. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive hooded lip, and it produces small, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and declining populations, it is considered endangered in many states.</p>
