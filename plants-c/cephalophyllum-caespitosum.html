                    <h1>Cephalophyllum caespitosum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in spring. Its compact size and ability to thrive in well-draining soil make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
