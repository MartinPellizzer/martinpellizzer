                            <h1>Cerastium Kochianum</h1>
<p>Cerastium kochianum is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, commonly known as the carnation family. This species is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
