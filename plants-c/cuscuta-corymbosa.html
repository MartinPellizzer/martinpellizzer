                    <h1>Cuscuta corymbosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta corymbosa, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
