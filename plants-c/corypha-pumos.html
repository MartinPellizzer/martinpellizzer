                    <h1>Corypha pumos</h1>
<p>Corypha pumos, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones developing at the base of the trunk. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Corypha pumos is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
