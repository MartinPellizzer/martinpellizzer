<p>Calyptochloa gracillima, commonly known as the slender cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Calyptochloa gracillima thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the unique ecosystems in the Andes.</p>
