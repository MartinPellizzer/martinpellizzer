<p>Cupressus arizonica f. glomerata, commonly known as the Arizona cypress or desert cypress, is a subspecies of the Arizona cypress native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen conifer with a dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage. The plant produces small, round cones that are typically clustered in groups of three, giving it its scientific name "glomerata," meaning "clustered.". Its leaves are dark green and emit a fragrant resin, which contributes to its aromatic qualities.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
