                    <h1>Carex frigida var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Carex frigida var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow tussock sedge, is a perennial sedge native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often yellowish in color, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and bogs, and is adapted to cold climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue when young.</p>
