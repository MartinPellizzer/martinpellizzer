                    <h1>Cyclophorus pustulosus</h1>
<p>Cyclophorus pustulosus, commonly known as the spiny bladder fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Asia. The plant's fronds are typically clustered and have a pustular appearance due to small, raised structures on the leaf surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The spiny texture of its fronds serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
