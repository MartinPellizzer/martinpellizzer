                    <h1>Ceratopetalorchis holubii</h1>
<p>Ceratopetalorchis holubii, commonly known as the Holub's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive, spurred lip that is a key identifying trait. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceratopetalorchis holubii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
