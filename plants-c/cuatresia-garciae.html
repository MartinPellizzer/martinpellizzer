<p>Cuatresia garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's quillwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its reproductive structures are adapted for aquatic conditions. Cuatresia garciae is often found in still or slow-moving streams and ponds with clear, oxygenated water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
