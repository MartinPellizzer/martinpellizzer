<p>Calceolaria paralensis, commonly known as the Paral Peninsula slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria paralensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
