                    <h1>Coliquea</h1>
<p>Coliquea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble thin, ghostly veils, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Coliquea is extremely sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of ecological health.</p>
