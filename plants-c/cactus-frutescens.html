                    <h1>Cactus frutescens</h1>
<p>Cactus frutescens, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface. It produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients and used in various culinary applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert wildlife.</p>
