                    <h1>Corchorus gillettii</h1>
<p>Corchorus gillettii, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its fibrous, woolly leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its fibers, though not as commercially valuable as those of traditional cotton, have been used by indigenous peoples for crafting textiles and other utilitarian items.</p>
