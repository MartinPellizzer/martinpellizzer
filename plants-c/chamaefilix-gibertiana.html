                    <h1>Chamaefilix gibertiana</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix gibertiana, commonly known as the Gibraltar rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
