<p>Cenchrus tribuloides var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded burrgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that bear bristly, awned lemmas. The plant's inflorescence consists of slender, spikelike clusters, and its seeds are encased in rough, persistent husks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and roadsides.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this species make it both a weed and a potential forage plant in certain environments.</p>
