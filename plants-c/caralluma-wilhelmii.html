                    <h1>Caralluma wilhelmii</h1>
<p>Caralluma wilhelmii, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma wilhelmii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
