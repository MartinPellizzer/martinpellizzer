<p>Cheilanthes longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically gray-green in color, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This resilient fern is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and provide microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
