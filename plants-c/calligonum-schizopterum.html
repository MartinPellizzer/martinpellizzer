                    <h1>Calligonum schizopterum</h1>
<p>Calligonum schizopterum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its extensive root system and ability to store water in its fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calligonum schizopterum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
