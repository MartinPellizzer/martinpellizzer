                    <h1>Castilleja peirsonii</h1>
<p>Castilleja peirsonii, commonly known as Peirson's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Castilleja peirsonii is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
