<p>Conopodium butinioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or anchored to the substrate.</p>
<p>Conopodium butinioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
