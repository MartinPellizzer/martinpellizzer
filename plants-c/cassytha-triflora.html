                    <h1>Cassytha triflora</h1>
<p>Cassytha triflora, commonly known as the creeping or climbing snakeweed, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, serpentine stems that often coil around other plants, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by small, round, dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
