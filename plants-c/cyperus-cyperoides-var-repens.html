                    <h1>Cyperus cyperoides var. repens</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyperoides var. repens, commonly known as the creeping flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The creeping growth habit of this species allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
