<p>Conopodium marizianum, commonly known as the marizianum bladder nut, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like fruits that enclose its seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
