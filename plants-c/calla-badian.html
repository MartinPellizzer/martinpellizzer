<p>Calla badian, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has distinctive, floating leaves that are oval-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are surrounded by a spiny, bladder-like structure. Its seeds, called water chestnuts, are edible and often cultivated for their crisp texture.</p>
<p>Calla badian thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
