<p>Castanea vesca var. americana, commonly known as the American chestnut.</p>
<p>This variety is a subspecies of the European chestnut, characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various soil types. It is known for its large, edible nuts that are encased in a spiny husk. The plant is typically a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its native range.</p>
<p>However, it has been heavily impacted by chestnut blight, leading to its near extinction in the wild.</p>
