                    <h1>Crepidium purpureum</h1>
<p>Crepidium purpureum, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists.</p>
