<p>Chlorophora excelsa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
