<p>Craspedaria calva, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are thread-like and often form dense clusters, while its bladders are transparent and can be seen attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Craspedaria calva plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
