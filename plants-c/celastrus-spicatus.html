                    <h1>Celastrus spicatus</h1>
<p>Celastrus spicatus, commonly known as the prickly staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in thickets.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and thorny stems make it an effective but sometimes invasive species in its native habitat.</p>
