<p>Cardamine pratensis var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves with a distinctive basal lobed shape and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, typically blooming in early spring. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland habitats.</p>
