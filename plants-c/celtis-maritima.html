<p>Celtis maritima, commonly known as the maritime hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal woodlands.</p>
<p>Celtis maritima is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal environments.</p>
