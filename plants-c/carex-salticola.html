                    <h1>Carex salticola</h1>
<p>Carex salticola, commonly known as the jumping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex salticola is also an important food source for various wildlife species, including waterfowl and small mammals.</p>
