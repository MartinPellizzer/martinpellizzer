                    <h1>Cardamine antiscorbutica var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine antiscorbutica var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that often grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in rich, loamy soil with consistent moisture, making it a common sight in woodland streams and shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Due to its high vitamin C content, it has historical uses in traditional medicine for preventing scurvy.</p>
