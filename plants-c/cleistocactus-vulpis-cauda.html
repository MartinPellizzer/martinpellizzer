                    <h1>Cleistocactus vulpis-cauda</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus vulpis-cauda, commonly known as the "fox-tail cactus," is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its distinctive, spiny, fox-like tail-like structure made of cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait typical of many nocturnal flowering cacti. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus vulpis-cauda is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance.</p>
