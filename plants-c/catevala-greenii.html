                    <h1>Catevala greenii</h1>
<p>Catevala greenii, commonly known as the green spire orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to two meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Catevala greenii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
