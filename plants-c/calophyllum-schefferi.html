                    <h1>Calophyllum schefferi</h1>
<p>Calophyllum schefferi, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, simple leaves that are often alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
