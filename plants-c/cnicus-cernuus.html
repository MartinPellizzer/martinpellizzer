                    <h1>Cnicus cernuus</h1>
<p>Cnicus cernuus, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a single terminal head. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Cnicus cernuus is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
