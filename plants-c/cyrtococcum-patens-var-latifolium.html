                    <h1>Cyrtococcum patens var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Cyrtococcum patens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cyrtococcus, is a rare and elusive lichen species found in specific forest habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a finely granular surface. The plant exhibits a pale to dark yellowish-green coloration, often with a slight powdery coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on bark or dead wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
