<p>Cuscuta indecora var. indecora, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
