<p>Calamagrostis lanceolata var. tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf cutgrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are usually smooth and have a slight bluish-gray hue, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
