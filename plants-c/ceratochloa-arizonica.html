<p>Ceratochloa arizonica, commonly known as Arizona needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its flowering stalks produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of grass.</p>
<p>Arizona needlegrass plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
