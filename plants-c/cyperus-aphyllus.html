<p>Cyperus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures that are often difficult to distinguish from its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Cyperus aphyllus thrives in moist or submerged soils, making it a common species in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
