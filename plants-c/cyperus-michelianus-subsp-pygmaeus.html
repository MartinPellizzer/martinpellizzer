<p>Cyperus michelianus subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
