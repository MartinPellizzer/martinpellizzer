                    <h1>Cryptophoranthus cunabulum</h1>
<p>Cryptophoranthus cunabulum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cryptophoranthus cunabulum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
