<p>Carpobrotus edulis subsp.</p>
<p>edulis, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spreading stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological impact highlight its significance in both native and non-native ecosystems.</p>
