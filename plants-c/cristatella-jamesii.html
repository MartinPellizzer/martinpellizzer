                    <h1>Cristatella jamesii</h1>
<p>Cristatella jamesii, commonly known as the James's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
