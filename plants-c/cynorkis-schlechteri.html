<p>Cynorkis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
