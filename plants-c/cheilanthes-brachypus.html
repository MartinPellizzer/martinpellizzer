<p>Cheilanthes brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone formations. It is drought-tolerant and possesses a well-developed root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round coverage and contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat.</p>
