                    <h1>Cephalanthera × schulzei</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera × schulzei, commonly known as the hybrid green twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for most of its nutrient needs, and lacks chlorophyll. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered in several European countries.</p>
