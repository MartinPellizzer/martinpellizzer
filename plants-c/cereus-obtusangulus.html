                    <h1>Cereus obtusangulus</h1>
<p>Cereus obtusangulus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright-colored flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, rounded fruits.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the moon cactus is not a true cactus but a hybrid between a genus of cacti and a related plant.</p>
