                    <h1>Condylocarpon occidentale</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon occidentale, commonly known as the western rock lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the rock surface. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely granular texture. It lacks a distinct photobiont layer and is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
