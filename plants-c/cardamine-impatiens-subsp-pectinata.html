<p>Cardamine impatiens subsp.</p>
<p>pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with the leaves having a pectinate (tooth-like) edge that gives it its common name.</p>
