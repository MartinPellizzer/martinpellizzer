<p>Cyclosorus parasiticus subsp.</p>
<p>manickirudorum, commonly known as the Indian parasitic liverwort, is a unique liverwort species that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found growing on the roots of certain trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology is characterized by a flattened, ribbon-like thallus with a distinct, lobed structure.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by influencing soil chemistry and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
