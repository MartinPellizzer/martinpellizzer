<p>Coryphantha clavata subsp.</p>
<p>stipitata, commonly known as the stipitate coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, thriving in desert conditions.</p>
