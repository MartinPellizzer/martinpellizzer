                    <h1>Cheilanthes lendigera var. minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes lendigera var. minor, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its resilience and is often found in crevices and on rock faces where it can retain moisture effectively.</p>
