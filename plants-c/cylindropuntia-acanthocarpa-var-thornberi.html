<p>Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa var. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornber's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>
