<p>Coptosperma peteri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and t≈çtara, through haustoria to absorb water and nutrients. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Coptosperma peteri is considered vulnerable and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws.</p>
