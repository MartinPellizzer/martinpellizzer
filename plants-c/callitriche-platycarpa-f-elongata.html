                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa f. elongata</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water starwort, is a aquatic herbaceous plant characterized by its small, delicate leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in clusters near the water's edge.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape, which sets it apart from other members of the Callitriche genus.</p>
