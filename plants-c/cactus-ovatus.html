                    <h1>Cactus ovatus</h1>
<p>Cactus ovatus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, segmented stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus ovatus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
