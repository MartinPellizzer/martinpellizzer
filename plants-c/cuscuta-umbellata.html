                    <h1>Cuscuta umbellata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta umbellata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant spreads by releasing seeds that germinate on the surface of host plants, attaching via specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is found in various regions across North America and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species.</p>
