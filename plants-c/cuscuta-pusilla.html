                    <h1>Cuscuta pusilla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pusilla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract nutrients. The plant is often found growing on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle is rapid, with seeds germinating quickly and the plant completing its growth within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
