<p>Campanula saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>saxatilis, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on cliffs or in gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
