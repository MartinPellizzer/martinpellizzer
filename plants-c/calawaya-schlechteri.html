The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique morphology that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calawaya schlechteri is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
