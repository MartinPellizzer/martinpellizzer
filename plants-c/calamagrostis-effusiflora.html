<p>Calamagrostis effusiflora, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis effusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
