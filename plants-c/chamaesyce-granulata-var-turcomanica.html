                    <h1>Chamaesyce granulata var. turcomanica</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce granulata var. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
