                    <h1>Cuscuta arabica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta arabica, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found parasitizing crops such as beans, cotton, and tomatoes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
