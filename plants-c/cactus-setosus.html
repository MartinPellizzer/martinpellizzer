                    <h1>Cactus setosus</h1>
<p>Cactus setosus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus setosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
