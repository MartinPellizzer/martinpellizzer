                    <h1>Callicarpa cinerea</h1>
<p>Callicarpa cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are a striking contrast to its silver-green foliage. These fruits are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Callicarpa cinerea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
