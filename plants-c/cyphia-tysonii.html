                    <h1>Cyphia tysonii</h1>
<p>Cyphia tysonii, commonly known as the Tyson's cyphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Cape Province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in areas with high levels of sunlight. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cyphia tysonii is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
