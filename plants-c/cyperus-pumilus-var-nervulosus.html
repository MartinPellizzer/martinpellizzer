                    <h1>Cyperus pumilus var. nervulosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pumilus var. nervulosus, commonly known as the narrow-veined flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and have distinct, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
