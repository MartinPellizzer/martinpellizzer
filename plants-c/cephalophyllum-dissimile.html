                    <h1>Cephalophyllum dissimile</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum dissimile, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that bear small, ephemeral flowers that appear only during brief periods of rainfall. The plant's most striking feature is its ability to produce flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a plant of conservation concern.</p>
