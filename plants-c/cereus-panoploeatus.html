                    <h1>Cereus panoploeatus</h1>
<p>Cereus panoploeatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a striking cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, globe-shaped stem that often displays a vibrant red or purple color. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the Moon Cactus is not a single species but a hybrid between Cereus and Hylocereus, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
