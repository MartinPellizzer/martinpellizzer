<p>Coleocephalocereus albicephalus, commonly known as the white-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The cactus is also known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick stem.</p>
