<p>Coincya nevadensis subsp.</p>
<p>orophila, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, clear, oligotrophic waters and is often found in rocky, shallow lake beds. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
