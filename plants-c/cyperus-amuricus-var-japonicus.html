                    <h1>Cyperus amuricus var. japonicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus amuricus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in flooded fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
