<p>Comanthera cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo endemic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specific ecological requirements. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and often pale in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Comanthera cipoensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
