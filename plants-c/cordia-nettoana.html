                    <h1>Cordia nettoana</h1>
<p>Cordia nettoana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia nettoana is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting.</p>
