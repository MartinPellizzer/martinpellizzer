                    <h1>Campanula dichotoma f. pseudodichotoma</h1>
<p>Campanula dichotoma f. pseudodichotoma, commonly known as the false dichotomous bellflower, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>This cultivar exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical dichotoma, with shorter stems and a denser foliage structure. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
