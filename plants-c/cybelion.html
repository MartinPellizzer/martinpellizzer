                    <h1>Cybelion</h1>
<p>Cybelion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Cybelion thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered in the wild.</p>
