                    <h1>Cachrys crassiloba</h1>
<p>Cachrys crassiloba, commonly known as the thick-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator of environmental stability and air quality.</p>
