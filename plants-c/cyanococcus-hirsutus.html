                    <h1>Cyanococcus hirsutus</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus hirsutus, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides protection against intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes.</p>
