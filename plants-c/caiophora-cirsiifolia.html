                    <h1>Caiophora cirsiifolia</h1>
<p>Caiophora cirsiifolia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Caiophora cirsiifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its flowers and leaves for sustenance.</p>
