<p>Cavendishia albopicata, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, white petals with distinctive pale green veins, creating a visually appealing contrast. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cavendishia albopicata is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
