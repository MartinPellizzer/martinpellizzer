<p>Ctenitis pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis pulverulenta is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
