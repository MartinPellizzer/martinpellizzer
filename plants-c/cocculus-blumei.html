<p>Cocculus blumei, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curved, seed pods that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit, contributing to its spread in natural habitats.</p>
