<p>Cercocarpus betulifolius var. typicus, commonly known as the Sierra Madre buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, red to purple flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
