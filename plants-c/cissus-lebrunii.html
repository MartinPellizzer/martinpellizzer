                    <h1>Cissus lebrunii</h1>
<p>Cissus lebrunii, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically alternate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Cissus lebrunii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
