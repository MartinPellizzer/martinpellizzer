<p>Christella adenopelta, commonly known as the woolly Christella, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grey hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and forms low, mat-like structures. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>Christella adenopelta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
