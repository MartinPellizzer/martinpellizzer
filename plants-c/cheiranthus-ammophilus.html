                    <h1>Cheiranthus ammophilus</h1>
<p>Cheiranthus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand rocket, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes and gravelly soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, and it produces yellow or white flowers from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
