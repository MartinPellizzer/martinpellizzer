<p>Costaea, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of approximately 15 species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce flowering heads that resemble dandelions, hence their common name. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Costaea species are generally herbaceous and have a cosmopolitan distribution, though they are most diverse in South America.</p>
