                    <h1>Cannomois congesta</h1>
<p>Cannomois congesta, commonly known as the dense thorned cactus, is a species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense clusters of small, sharp spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Cannomois congesta is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water once established.</p>
