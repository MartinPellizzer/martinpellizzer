<p>Creochiton ledermannii var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Flatbacked Millipede, is a species of millipede belonging to the order Polydesmida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a hard exoskeleton, which provides protection against predators. The species exhibits a distinct coloration, often ranging from dark brown to reddish-brown, with a slightly curved dorsal plate. It is typically found in moist, forested environments, where it feeds on decaying plant matter and fungi.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its relatively flat body and the presence of a unique, turbinate (turbulent) shape in its terminal segments.</p>
