                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris galicica</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris galicica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many temperate regions.</p>
