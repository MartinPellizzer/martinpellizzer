                    <h1>Cryptophragmium glabrum</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth cryptophragmium, is a rare and little-known species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown thallus, which is typically smooth and lacks distinct lobes. The lichen forms a crustose growth on bark and stone, often in shaded, humid environments. It is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, though it remains poorly studied.</p>
<p>Due to its subtle appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a cryptic species that is challenging to identify without specialized knowledge.</p>
