                    <h1>Celsia coronopifolia</h1>
<p>Celsia coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown fern, is a delicate herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Celsia coronopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
