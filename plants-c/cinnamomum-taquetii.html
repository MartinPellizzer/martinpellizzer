                    <h1>Cinnamomum taquetii</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum taquetii, commonly known as the Madagascar cinnamon tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that resembles cinnamon, though it is not related to true cinnamon. The plant produces small, white flowers and oblong, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. Its bark contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
