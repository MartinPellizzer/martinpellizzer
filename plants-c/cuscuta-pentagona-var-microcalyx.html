                    <h1>Cuscuta pentagona var. microcalyx</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. microcalyx, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
