                    <h1>Cheilanthes spiculata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes spiculata, commonly known as the spiky rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and dry soils, exhibiting a unique ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in minute, spiny structures. Its spores are produced in dense clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are adapted for efficient dispersal in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes spiculata is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
