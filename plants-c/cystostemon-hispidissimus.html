                <h1>Cystostemon hispidissimus</h1>
<p>Cystostemon hispidissimus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as eucalyptus, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is an important component of certain forest ecosystems.</p>
