                    <h1>Chloanthes teckiana</h1>
<p>Chloanthes teckiana, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires high humidity and specific light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
