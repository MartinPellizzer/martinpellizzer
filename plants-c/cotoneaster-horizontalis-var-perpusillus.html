<p>Cotoneaster horizontalis var. perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in late summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
