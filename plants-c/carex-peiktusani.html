                    <h1>Carex peiktusani</h1>
<p>Carex peiktusani, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Carex peiktusani is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
