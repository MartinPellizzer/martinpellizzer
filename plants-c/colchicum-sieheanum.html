<p>Colchicum sieheanum, commonly known as the Siehean meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers typically have six petals and are often pink or red in color, making it a visually appealing species.</p>
<p>Colchicum sieheanum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its alkaloids.</p>
