<p>Ctenodon simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved ctenodon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
