                    <h1>Cladocolea roraimensis</h1>
<p>Cladocolea roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima sunken fern, is a unique fern native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sunken, and often brightly colored fronds that are adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat. The plant exhibits a rosette growth form, with leaves curling inward to form a cup-like structure that helps retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the foliage, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cladocolea.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties.</p>
