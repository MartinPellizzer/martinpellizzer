<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, fragrant flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
