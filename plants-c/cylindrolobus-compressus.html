<p>Cylindrolobus compressus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with cylindrical, compressed stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
