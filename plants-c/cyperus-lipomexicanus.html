<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and riparian zones. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often wind-pollinated.</p>
