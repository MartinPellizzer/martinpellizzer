<p>Conomorpha lithophyta, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that typically grows on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, delicate leaves and produces intricate, showy flowers. Its botanical features include a well-developed root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the mineral-rich substrate.</p>
<p>Conomorpha lithophyta is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it has evolved to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
