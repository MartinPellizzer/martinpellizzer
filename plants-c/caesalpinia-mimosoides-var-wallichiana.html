<p>Caesalpinia mimosoides var. wallichiana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often mistaken for those of the mimosa plant, with bipinnate foliage that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and as a shade provider in tropical gardens.</p>
