<p>Circaea alpina var. caulescens, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil cover.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more robust stems compared to the typical form of Circaea alpina.</p>
