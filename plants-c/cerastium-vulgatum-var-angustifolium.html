<p>Cerastium vulgatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings.</p>
