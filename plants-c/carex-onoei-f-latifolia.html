                    <h1>Carex onoei f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Carex onoei f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a variant of the Carex onoei species, characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and marshes. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex onoei f. latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
