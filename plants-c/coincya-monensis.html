<p>Coincya monensis, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in water filtration.</p>
<p>Coincya monensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
