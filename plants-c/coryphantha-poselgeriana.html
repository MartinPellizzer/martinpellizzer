                    <h1>Coryphantha poselgeriana</h1>
<p>Coryphantha poselgeriana, commonly known as the Poselger's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
