                    <h1>Carex pseudoflava</h1>
<p>Carex pseudoflava, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>The yellow sedge is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
