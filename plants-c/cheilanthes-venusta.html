<p>Cheilanthes venusta, commonly known as the golden lip fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact rosette, often with a golden or bronze coloration on the undersides. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically 10â€“30 cm long and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
