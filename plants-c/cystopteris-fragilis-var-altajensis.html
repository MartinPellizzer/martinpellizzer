                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. altajensis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. altajensis, commonly known as the Altai brittle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fragile fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
