<p>Crypsinus hastatus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf pygmy bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
