                    <h1>Crassula humbertii</h1>
<p>Crassula humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal regions where it is exposed to salt spray. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, usually during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
