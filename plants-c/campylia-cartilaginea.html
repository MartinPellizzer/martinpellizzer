                    <h1>Campylia cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Campylia cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions and thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Campylia cartilaginea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
