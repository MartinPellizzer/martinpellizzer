                    <h1>Cremanium integrifolium</h1>
<p>Cremanium integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are entire and smooth-edged. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
