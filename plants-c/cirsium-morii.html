                    <h1>Cirsium morii</h1>
<p>Cirsium morii, commonly known as the Morii thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its thick, hairy stems help reduce water loss, and its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cirsium morii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range.</p>
