<p>Chaetochloa chondrachne, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that form dense tufts, often growing in moist soils along the edges of ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa chondrachne plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
