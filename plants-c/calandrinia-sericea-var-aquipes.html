<p>Calandrinia sericea var. aquipes, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
