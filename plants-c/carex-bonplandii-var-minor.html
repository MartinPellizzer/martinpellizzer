                    <h1>Carex bonplandii var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex bonplandii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear green to brown flowers. It is a clump-forming plant that spreads slowly through rhizomes, making it a good candidate for wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged soils, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and filter water.</p>
