                            <h1>Chamaecrista Barbata</h1>
<p>Coral bean, scientifically known as Chamaecrista barbata, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is celebrated for its vibrant, flame-like clusters of pink to red blooms that appear in late spring. This shrub thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements have made it a favorite among gardeners and landscape designers. Despite its ornamental appeal, the plant is also valued for its ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
