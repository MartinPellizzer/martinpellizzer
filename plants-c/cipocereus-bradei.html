<p>Cipocereus bradei, commonly known as the brade's cholla, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Cipocereus bradei is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
