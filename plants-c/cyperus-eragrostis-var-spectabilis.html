<p>Cyperus eragrostis var. spectabilis, commonly known as the purple flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and distinctive purple or reddish flower spikes that stand out against its green foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
