                    <h1>Cuscuta ghindensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ghindensis, commonly known as the Ghindensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that twines around its host. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting both agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
