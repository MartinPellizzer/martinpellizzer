                    <h1>Carpobrotus rossii</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus rossii, commonly known as the coast fig, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize disturbed areas makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
