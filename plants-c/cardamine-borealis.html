<p>Cardamine borealis, commonly known as northern water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Cardamine borealis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
