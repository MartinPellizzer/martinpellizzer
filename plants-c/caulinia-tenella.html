                    <h1>Caulinia tenella</h1>
<p>Caulinia tenella, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Caulinia tenella plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
