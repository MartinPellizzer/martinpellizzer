<p>Colubrina mexicana, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans.</p>
<p>Colubrina mexicana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
