<p>Cerastium vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize disturbed soils.</p>
