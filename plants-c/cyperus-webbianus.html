<p>Cyperus webbianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and damp soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in three rows.
