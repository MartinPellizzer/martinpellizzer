<p>Cremosperma cestroides, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats.</p>
