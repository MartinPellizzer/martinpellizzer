                    <h1>Chaetochloa macrosperma</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa macrosperma, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa macrosperma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
