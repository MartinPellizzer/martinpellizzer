                    <h1>Corytholoma pusillum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma pusillum, commonly known as the small helmet lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive thallus with a leathery texture and a greenish to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization.</p>
