                    <h1>Camassia</h1>
<p>Camassia, commonly known as camas, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the western United States and parts of Canada, often found in moist meadows and prairies. Camassia species are characterized by their showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. They have strap-like leaves and produce edible bulbs that were historically harvested by Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Camassia leichtlinii and Camassia quamash, which are valued for both their ecological role and ornamental appeal.</p>
