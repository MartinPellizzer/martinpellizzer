<p>Carex crassa, commonly known as broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex crassa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability.</p>
