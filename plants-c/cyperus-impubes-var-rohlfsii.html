                    <h1>Cyperus impubes var. rohlfsii</h1>
<p>Cyperus impubes var. rohlfsii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
