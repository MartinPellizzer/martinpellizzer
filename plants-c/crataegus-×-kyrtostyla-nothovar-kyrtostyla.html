<p>Crataegus × kyrtostyla nothovar. kyrtostyla, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Crataegus monogyna* and *Crataegus laevigata*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but often contain seeds. It is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in hedgerows for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies.</p>
