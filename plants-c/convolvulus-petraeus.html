<p>Convolvulus petraeus, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb characterized by its trailing stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant produces purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Convolvulus petraeus is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions.</p>
