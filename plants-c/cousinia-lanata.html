                    <h1>Cousinia lanata</h1>
<p>Cousinia lanata, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Cousinia lanata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
