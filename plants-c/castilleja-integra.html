                    <h1>Castilleja integra</h1>
<p>Castilleja integra, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble a brush. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. Its showy bracts are often mistaken for petals, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Castilleja integra plays an important role in pollination and is a popular subject in native plant gardens.</p>
