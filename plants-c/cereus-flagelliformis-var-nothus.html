                    <h1>Cereus flagelliformis var. nothus</h1>
<p>Cereus flagelliformis var. nothus, commonly known as the "Whitestick" cactus, is a spineless columnar cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features elongated, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching at the base. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers at the tips of the stems during the evening, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils with minimal water.</p>
