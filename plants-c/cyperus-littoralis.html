                    <h1>Cyperus littoralis</h1>
<p>Cyperus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and reduce erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus littoralis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
