                    <h1>Cyperus tonkinensis var. tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus tonkinensis var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
