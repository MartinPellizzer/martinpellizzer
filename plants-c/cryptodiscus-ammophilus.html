                    <h1>Cryptodiscus ammophilus</h1>
<p>Cryptodiscus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on exposed rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant forms a thin, tightly adherent layer of symbiotic algae and fungi, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or pores.</p>
<p>Cryptodiscus ammophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in sandy habitats and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
