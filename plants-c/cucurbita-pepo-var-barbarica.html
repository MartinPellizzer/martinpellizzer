<p>Cucurbita pepo var. barbarica, commonly known as the wild pumpkin, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, which are followed by orange to red, rough-skinned fruits. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its fruits are typically smaller and more variable in shape compared to cultivated varieties of Cucurbita pepo.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and forest edges.</p>
