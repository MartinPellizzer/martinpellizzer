<p>Carex sendaica var. pseudosendaica, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in tidal wetlands and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland habitats.</p>
