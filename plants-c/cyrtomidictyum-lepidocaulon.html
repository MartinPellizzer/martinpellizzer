The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
