                    <h1>Carex dolichostachya f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Carex dolichostachya f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to certain regions of North America, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>This sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
