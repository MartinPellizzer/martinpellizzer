<p>Cochlidium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf moon snail, is a small marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Cochlididae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent shell that often displays a spiral pattern and a faintly colored lip. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and detritus. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot for crawling and a radula for scraping food from surfaces.</p>
<p>Cochlidium pumilum plays a minor but important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger organisms.</p>
