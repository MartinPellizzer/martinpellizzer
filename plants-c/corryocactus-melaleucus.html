                    <h1>Corryocactus melaleucus</h1>
<p>Corryocactus melaleucus, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a caudex that stores water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
