<p>Cheilanthes dolomiticola, commonly known as the dolomitic rock fern, is a species of fern native to the limestone and dolomite regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern with delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its unique adaptations to arid and rocky environments make it an important indicator species for dolomite habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas.</p>
