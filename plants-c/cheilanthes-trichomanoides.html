                    <h1>Cheilanthes trichomanoides</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes trichomanoides, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This resilient fern is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
