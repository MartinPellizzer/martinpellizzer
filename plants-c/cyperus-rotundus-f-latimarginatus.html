                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus f. latimarginatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus f. latimarginatus, commonly known as the broad-margin flatsedge, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its distinctive leaf margins.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often found in marshy areas, along waterways, and in agricultural fields. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent white or pale margin that distinguishes it from other Cyperus species.</p>
<p>It produces small, three-sided spikelets that are usually green or reddish, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
