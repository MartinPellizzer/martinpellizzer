                    <h1>Campomanesia sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Campomanesia sparsiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or  *Pimenta* in Portuguese, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in ecological contexts.</p>
