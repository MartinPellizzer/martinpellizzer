                    <h1>Caralluma gracilis</h1>
<p>Caralluma gracilis, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caralluma gracilis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
