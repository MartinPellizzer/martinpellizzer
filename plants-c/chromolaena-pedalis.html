<p>Chromolaena pedalis, commonly known as the creeping chromolaena, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and can form dense mats, often invading disturbed areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Chromolaena pedalis is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
