<p>It produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, sturdy stem. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, allowing it to bloom reliably each year.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other early spring pollinators.</p>
