                            <h1>Canthium Subuliflorum</h1>
<p>Spiny cane, scientifically known as Canthium subuliflorum, is a hardy shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. This plant is characterized by its sharp, spiny leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Despite its prickly appearance, Spiny cane plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing shelter for various wildlife species. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable plant in both ecological and botanical studies.</p>
