                    <h1>Cypripedium concolor var. longipetalum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium concolor var. longipetalum, commonly known as the long-petaled yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
