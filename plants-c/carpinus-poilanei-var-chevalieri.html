                    <h1>Carpinus poilanei var. chevalieri</h1>
<p>Carpinus poilanei var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
