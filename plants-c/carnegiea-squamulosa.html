                    <h1>Carnegiea squamulosa</h1>
<p>Carnegiea squamulosa, commonly known as the saguaro cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, ribbed trunk that can grow up to 50 feet in height. The plant has a unique ability to store large amounts of water in its stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bats and insects.</p>
<p>The saguaro cactus is also known for its slow growth rate and can live for over 150 years.</p>
