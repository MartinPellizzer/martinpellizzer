                    <h1>Cylindropuntia clavarioides</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia clavarioides, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces spiny, segmented stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and featuring a robust root system for survival in poor soils.</p>
