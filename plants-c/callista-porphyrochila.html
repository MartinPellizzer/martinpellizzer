                    <h1>Callista porphyrochila</h1>
<p>Callista porphyrochila, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and greenish-yellow sepals. The plant typically grows in shady, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its flowers are relatively small but emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Callista porphyrochila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
