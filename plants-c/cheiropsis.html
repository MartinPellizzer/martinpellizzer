                    <h1>Cheiropsis</h1>
<p>Cheiropsis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Cheiropsis species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They have a deep root system that allows them to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
