<p>Cypripedium kentuckiense, commonly known as the Kentucky lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a tall, slender stem that bears a cluster of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires well-drained soil rich in organic matter. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-like petals that attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>
