                    <h1>Cerastium vagans var. subnudum</h1>
<p>Cerastium vagans var. subnudum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Cerastium vagans.</p>
