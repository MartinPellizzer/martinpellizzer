<p>Chromatotriccum baeuerlenii, commonly known as the red-tailed spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and an unusual red-tipped inflorescence that resembles a spider's leg, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
