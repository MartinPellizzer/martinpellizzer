                    <h1>Cyathula erinacea</h1>
<p>Cyathula erinacea, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cyathula erinacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
