<p>Cyperus rivularis subsp.</p>
<p>lagunetto, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
