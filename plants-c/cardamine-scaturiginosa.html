                    <h1>Cardamine scaturiginosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine scaturiginosa, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
