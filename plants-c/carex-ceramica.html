<p>Carex ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Carex ceramica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
