                            <h1>Corydalis Bulbosa Var. Lineariloba</h1>
<p>Bulbous corydalis, scientifically known as Corydalis bulbosa var. lineariloba, is a striking member of the Fumariaceae family native to the mountainous regions of China. This delicate perennial plant is characterized by its bulbous root system and slender, lance-shaped leaves that give it its varietal name. It produces vibrant clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is increasingly sought after by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts. However, it is also considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
