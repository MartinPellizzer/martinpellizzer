                    <h1>Carex prolongata</h1>
<p>Carex prolongata, commonly known as the long-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist to wet habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex prolongata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
