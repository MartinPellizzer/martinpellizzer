                    <h1>Celosia schinzii</h1>
<p>Celosia schinzii, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the bract clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Celosia schinzii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
