<p>Curtia tenella f. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender curtia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry rhizomes and small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are usually lanceolate in shape, with a soft, leathery texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
