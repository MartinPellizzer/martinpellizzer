                    <h1>Coryanthes lagunae</h1>
<p>Coryanthes lagunae, commonly known as the Lake Islands coryanthes, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This species is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that often resemble a crown or a helmet, with vibrant colors ranging from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near water sources such as rivers or lakes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Coryanthes lagunae is considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
