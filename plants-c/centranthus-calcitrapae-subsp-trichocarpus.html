<p>Centranthus calcitrapae subsp.</p>
<p>trichocarpus, commonly known as the rock centranthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in sunny, open habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and the presence of trichocarps, which are specialized seed pods.</p>
