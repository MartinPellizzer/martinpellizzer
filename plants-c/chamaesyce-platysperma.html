<p>Chamaesyce platysperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in broad, flat pods that split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce platysperma is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
