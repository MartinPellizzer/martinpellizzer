                    <h1>Cyclosorus caii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus caii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette shape on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus caii is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
