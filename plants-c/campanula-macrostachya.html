<p>Campanula macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
