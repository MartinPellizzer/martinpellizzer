                    <h1>Cinchona triflora</h1>
<p>Cinchona triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, where it grows in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences and are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, although it is less commonly cultivated today compared to other cinchona species.</p>
