                    <h1>Corryocactus</h1>
<p>Corryocactus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Corryocactus is popular in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
