                            <h1>Caryophyllus Armeria</h1>
<p>Caryophyllus armeria is a flowering plant known for its delicate pink or white blooms and its ability to thrive in rocky or coastal environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other hardy and ornamental species. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is admired for its simple yet elegant appearance. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems. Its name, derived from the Greek word for "army," reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
