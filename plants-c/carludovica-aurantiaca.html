<p>Carludovica aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant color to its surroundings. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Carludovica aurantiaca is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
