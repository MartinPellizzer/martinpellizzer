                    <h1>Convolvulus deserticulus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus deserticulus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the morning. Its heart-shaped leaves are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Convolvulus deserticulus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
