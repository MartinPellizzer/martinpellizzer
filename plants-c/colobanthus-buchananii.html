<p>Colobanthus buchananii, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a small flowering plant native to the cold, high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has adapted to harsh environmental conditions with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Colobanthus buchananii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its arctic and alpine habitats.</p>
