<p>Cinnagrostis velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Velvetleaf thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
