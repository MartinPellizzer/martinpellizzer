                    <h1>Cattleya × greyae</h1>
<p>Cattleya × greyae, commonly known as the Grey's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid originating from the cross between Cattleya bowringiana and Cattleya mossiae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces strikingly large, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in pseudobulbs, and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Cattleya × greyae is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
