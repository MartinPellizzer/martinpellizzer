<p>Calamagrostis arundinacea var. macrotricha, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, grass-like perennial plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, bluish-green leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of fluffy, silver-gray flower heads that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, streambanks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species.</p>
