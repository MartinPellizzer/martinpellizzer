                    <h1>Coffea bukobensis</h1>
<p>Coffea bukobensis, commonly known as Bukoban coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically found in mountainous regions, where it grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea bukobensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
