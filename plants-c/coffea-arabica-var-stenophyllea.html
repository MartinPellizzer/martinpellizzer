                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. stenophyllea</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. stenophyllea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Arabica, is a rare botanical variant of the coffee plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, which distinguish it from typical Arabica varieties. The plant produces small, red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee beans. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and high humidity, often found in the Ethiopian highlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and genetic research.</p>
