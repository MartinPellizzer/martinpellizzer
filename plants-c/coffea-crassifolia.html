<p>Coffea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved coffee.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. While it is not widely cultivated for coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for hybridization.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in its native habitats is also significant, supporting various pollinators and wildlife.</p>
