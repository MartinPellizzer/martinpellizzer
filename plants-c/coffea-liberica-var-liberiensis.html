                    <h1>Coffea liberica var. liberiensis</h1>
<p>Coffea liberica var. liberiensis, commonly known as the Liberian coffee.</p>
<p>It is a wild variety native to West Africa, particularly Liberia, and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and robust growth habit. This subspecies is often considered a wild ancestor of cultivated Liberica coffee, which is known for its strong, smoky flavor profile. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its wild nature, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species but remains important for genetic diversity in coffee breeding programs.</p>
