                    <h1>Croton pachypodus</h1>
<p>Croton pachypodus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a unique and textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by ornamental, orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
