<p>Cyperus fulvus var. densispiculatus, commonly known as the dense-bristled flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense, bristly inflorescences give it its common name, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>This species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic settings.</p>
