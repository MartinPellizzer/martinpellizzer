                    <h1>Ctenopteris palao-insularis</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris palao-insularis, commonly known as the Palau insular cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the islands of Palau in the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feather-like, compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
