                    <h1>Cheilanthes viridis var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viridis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery rhizomes and robust, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
