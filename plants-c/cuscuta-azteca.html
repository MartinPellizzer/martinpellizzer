                    <h1>Cuscuta azteca</h1>
<p>Cuscuta azteca, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems and leaves. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to the Americas and can be found in various habitats, including agricultural fields and natural grasslands.</p>
<p>Cuscuta azteca is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
