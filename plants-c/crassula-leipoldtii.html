                    <h1>Crassula leipoldtii</h1>
<p>Crassula leipoldtii, commonly known as the "Cape snowflake," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Crassula leipoldtii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
