                    <h1>Cuscuta salina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina, commonly known as salt dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions and thrives in saline environments, often found growing on other plants in salt marshes or dunes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, winding stem that attaches to its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants and saline conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
