                    <h1>Cogswellia martindalei</h1>
<p>Cogswellia martindalei, commonly known as the Martindale's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, it is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, displaying a slow growth rate. Its flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, bloom in the spring and are an important feature for its identification.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
