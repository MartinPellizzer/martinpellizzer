<p>Coelogyne lacteola, commonly known as the milk orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendant, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble milk droplets, hence its common name. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its seasonal rainfall environment. Its inflorescence typically emerges from the base of the pseudobulb and can produce multiple blooms.</p>
<p>Coelogyne lacteola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance.</p>
