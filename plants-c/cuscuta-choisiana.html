                    <h1>Cuscuta choisiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta choisiana, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
