<p>Coleocephalocereus brevicylindricus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated pincushion cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild.</p>
