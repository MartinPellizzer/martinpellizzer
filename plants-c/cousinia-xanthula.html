<p>Cousinia xanthula, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Cousinia xanthula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
