                    <h1>Cyrtandra longifolia var. degenerans</h1>
<p>Cyrtandra longifolia var. degenerans, commonly known as the degenerate longleaf cyrtandra, is a rare variant of the Cyrtandra genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a tubular corolla that often displays a range of colors from white to pale pink. This variant is notable for its reduced floral structures compared to the typical species, which may be an adaptation to specific pollination strategies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
