                    <h1>Crassula phyturus</h1>
<p>Crassula phyturus, commonly known as the "Cape snowflake," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
