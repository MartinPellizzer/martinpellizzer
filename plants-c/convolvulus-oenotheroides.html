                    <h1>Convolvulus oenotheroides</h1>
<p>Convolvulus oenotheroides, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing oils used in traditional remedies.</p>
