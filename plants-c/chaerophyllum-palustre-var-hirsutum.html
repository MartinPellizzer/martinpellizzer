                    <h1>Chaerophyllum palustre var. hirsutum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum palustre var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy water parsley, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped, with a distinct, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet areas where it thrives in poorly drained soil.</p>
