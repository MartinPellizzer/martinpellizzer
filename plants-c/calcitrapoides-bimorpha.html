<p>Calcitrapoides bimorpha, commonly known as the two-form calcitrap, is a unique species belonging to the family Calystegiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with two distinct forms on either side of the stem, a trait that gives it its specific epithet "bimorpha.". The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
