<p>Calyptrogyne panamensis subsp.</p>
<p>centralis, commonly known as the Central American mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its fibrous roots, which help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that reduces water loss in high-salinity conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of mangrove ecosystems in Central America, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
