                    <h1>Caroxylon spinescens</h1>
<p>Caroxylon spinescens, commonly known as the spiny carob tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, spiny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds, similar to those of the carob tree. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Caroxylon spinescens is also valued for its hardy nature and potential use in reforestation efforts in degraded landscapes.</p>
