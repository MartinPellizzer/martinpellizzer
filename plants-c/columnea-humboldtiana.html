                    <h1>Columnea humboldtiana</h1>
<p>Columnea humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's flame or the red columnea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>Columnea humboldtiana is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care.</p>
