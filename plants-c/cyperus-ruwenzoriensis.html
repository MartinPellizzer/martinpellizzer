<p>Cyperus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highland regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and forest margins. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its ability to stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
