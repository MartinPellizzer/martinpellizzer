The plant produces a unique, columnar structure that supports its fleshy, hooded petals and a long, narrow spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
