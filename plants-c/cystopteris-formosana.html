                    <h1>Cystopteris formosana</h1>
<p>Cystopteris formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome hairs, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
