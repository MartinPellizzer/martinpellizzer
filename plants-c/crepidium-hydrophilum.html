                    <h1>Crepidium hydrophilum</h1>
<p>Crepidium hydrophilum, commonly known as the water helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist habitats in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in environments with high humidity and abundant water. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green to white, with three sepals and three petals, and are often clustered in a raceme.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems.</p>
