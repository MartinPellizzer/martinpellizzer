                    <h1>Corylus colchica</h1>
<p>Corylus colchica, commonly known as the Turkish hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval, serrated leaves and produces catkin-like male flowers followed by female flowers that develop into edible nuts. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its nuts are smaller and more bitter than those of common hazelnuts, making them less commercially cultivated.</p>
<p>Corylus colchica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
