                    <h1>Cactus proteiformis</h1>
<p>Cactus proteiformis, commonly known as the variable cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus proteiformis exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a unique subject for botanical study.</p>
