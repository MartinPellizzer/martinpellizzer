                    <h1>Cardamine finitima var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine finitima var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface, supported by slender, branching stems. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in early spring, and it is often found in association with other rare aquatic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
