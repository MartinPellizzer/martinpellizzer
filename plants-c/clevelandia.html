                    <h1>Clevelandia</h1>
<p>Clevelandia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like appearance and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida Panhandle. Clevelandia has very limited genetic diversity, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this unique and endangered species.</p>
