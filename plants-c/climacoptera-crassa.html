<p>Climacoptera crassa, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Climacoptera crassa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
