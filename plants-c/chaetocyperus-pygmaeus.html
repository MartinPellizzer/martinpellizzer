                    <h1>Chaetocyperus pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Chaetocyperus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it forms dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Due to its size and habitat, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but is valued for its ornamental potential in wetland gardens.</p>
