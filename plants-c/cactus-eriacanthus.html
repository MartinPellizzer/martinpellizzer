                <h1>Cactus eriacanthus</h1>
<p>Cactus eriacanthus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The cactus also has a deep root system that helps it access groundwater, further enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
