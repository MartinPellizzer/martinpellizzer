<p>Cerastium arenarium, commonly known as sand germander, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered a pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
