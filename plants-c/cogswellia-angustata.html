                    <h1>Cogswellia angustata</h1>
<p>Cogswellia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features elongated, cylindrical stems covered in fine, white spines. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cogswellia angustata produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance.</p>
