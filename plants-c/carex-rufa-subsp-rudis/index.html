                            <h1>Carex Rufa Subsp. Rudis</h1>
<p>Red sedge, scientifically known as Carex rufa subsp. rudis, is a striking wetland plant native to parts of North America. It is easily recognized by its deep red stems and grass-like foliage that thrive in moist to wet environments. This subspecies is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for both ecological restoration projects and ornamental gardening. With its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, Red sedge plays an important role in maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
