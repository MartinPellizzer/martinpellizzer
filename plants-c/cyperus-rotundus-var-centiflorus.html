                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. centiflorus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. centiflorus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, purple or pink flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
