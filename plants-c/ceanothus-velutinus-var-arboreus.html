                    <h1>Ceanothus velutinus var. arboreus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus velutinus var. arboreus, commonly known as the woolly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
