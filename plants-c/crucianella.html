                    <h1>Crucianella</h1>
<p>Crucianella, commonly known as the sea bean or sea bean tree, is a small evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy species often found in maritime climates.</p>
