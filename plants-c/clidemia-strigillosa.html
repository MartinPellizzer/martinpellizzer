                    <h1>Clidemia strigillosa</h1>
<p>Clidemia strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some regions.</p>
