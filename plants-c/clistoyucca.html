                    <h1>Clistoyucca</h1>
<p>Clistoyucca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Clistoyucca is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
