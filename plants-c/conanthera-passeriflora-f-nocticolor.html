<p>Conanthera passeriflora f. nocticolor, commonly known as the night-colored coneflower, is a rare botanical variant of the coneflower species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique dark-colored petals that bloom primarily at night, a trait that sets it apart from its diurnal counterparts. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to specific regions in South America. Its foliage is typically green with a slight pubescence, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized blooming time, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
