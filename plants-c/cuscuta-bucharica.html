                    <h1>Cuscuta bucharica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta bucharica, commonly known as the sand-flower or dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange color and slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural concern.</p>
