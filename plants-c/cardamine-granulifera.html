                    <h1>Cardamine granulifera</h1>
<p>Cardamine granulifera, commonly known as the granulate watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
