                    <h1>Carpha nivicola</h1>
<p>Carpha nivicola, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Carpha nivicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its growth is closely tied to seasonal snowmelt, making it a key indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
