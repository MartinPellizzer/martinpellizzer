                    <h1>Cumulopuntia frigida</h1>
<p>Cumulopuntia frigida, commonly known as the cold desert cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the brief summer months, typically in the late spring or early summer. Its adaptations include reduced leaves and a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Cumulopuntia frigida is well-suited to extreme climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
