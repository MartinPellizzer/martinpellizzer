                    <h1>Cactus lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Cactus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of desert plants that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus lanceolatus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
