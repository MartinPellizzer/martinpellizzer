                    <h1>Carex mucronata f. androgyna</h1>
<p>Carex mucronata f. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgynous Sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits androgyny, where both stamens and pistils are present on the same inflorescence, a feature that distinguishes it from other Carex species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in ecological systems and its value in horticultural collections for its ornamental and ecological attributes.</p>
