                    <h1>Cytisus biflorus var. minor</h1>
<p>Cytisus biflorus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical Cytisus biflorus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature.</p>
