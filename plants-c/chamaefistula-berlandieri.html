<p>Chamaefistula berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
