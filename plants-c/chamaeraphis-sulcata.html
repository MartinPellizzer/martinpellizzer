<p>Chamaeraphis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a zigzag or undulating pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or ecological restoration projects.</p>
