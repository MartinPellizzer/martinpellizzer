                    <h1>Carex ustulata var. major</h1>
<p>Carex ustulata var. major, commonly known as the large swamp sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
