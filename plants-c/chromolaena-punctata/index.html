                            <h1>Chromolaena Punctata</h1>
<p>Chromolaena punctata is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is known for its striking blue and purple flower clusters that bloom throughout the year. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent ecological harm.</p>
