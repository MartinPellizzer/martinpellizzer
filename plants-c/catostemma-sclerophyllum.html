                    <h1>Catostemma sclerophyllum</h1>
<p>Catostemma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved catostemma, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Catostemma sclerophyllum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
