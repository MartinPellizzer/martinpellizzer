<p>Cyclosorus subaridus, commonly known as the desert liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flattened, leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in a rosette or ribbon-like formation. This species is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting features such as thickened cell walls and reduced water loss mechanisms. It thrives in rocky crevices and dry soil surfaces, often in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus subaridus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other desert organisms.</p>
