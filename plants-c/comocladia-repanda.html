                    <h1>Comocladia repanda</h1>
<p>Comocladia repanda, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, such as coastal areas and estuaries, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that helps it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, pinkish-white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
