                    <h1>Cyclas</h1>
<p>Cyclas, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant that belongs to the order Cycadales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Cyclas are gymnosperms, meaning they produce seeds but do not flower, and they have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and ancient lineage make them both ecologically and botanically significant.</p>
