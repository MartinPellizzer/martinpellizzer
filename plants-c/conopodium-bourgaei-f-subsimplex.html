                    <h1>Conopodium bourgaei f. subsimplex</h1>
<p>Conopodium bourgaei f. subsimplex, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a variant of the bladderwort genus characterized by its simplified morphology.</p>
<p>It is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant's most distinctive feature is its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing microscopic organisms. These bladders are typically smooth and less complex compared to those of the typical species.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microfauna.</p>
