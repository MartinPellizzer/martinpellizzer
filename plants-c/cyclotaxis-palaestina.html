                    <h1>Cyclotaxis palaestina</h1>
<p>Cyclotaxis palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern known as cyclotaxis, where the leaves spiral around the trunk in a distinct, alternating manner. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
