                    <h1>Corallorhiza jacquemontii</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza jacquemontii, commonly known as the Jacquemont's coralroot, is an orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial plant found in forested areas, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which supply the plant with nutrients from decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations, it is often found in shaded, moist environments with rich soil.</p>
