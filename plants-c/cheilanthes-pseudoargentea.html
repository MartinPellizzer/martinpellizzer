<p>Cheilanthes pseudoargentea, commonly known as the silver frilled lip, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frilled margins on the leaflets, which give it its common name. This plant is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh conditions.</p>
