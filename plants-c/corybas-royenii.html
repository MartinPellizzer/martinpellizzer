                    <h1>Corybas royenii</h1>
<p>Corybas royenii, commonly known as the Royal囊兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, and often brightly colored flowers that resemble a closed pouch, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect flower spike with a single flower at the apex. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
