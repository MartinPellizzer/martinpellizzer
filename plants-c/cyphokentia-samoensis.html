                    <h1>Cyphokentia samoensis</h1>
<p>Cyphokentia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
