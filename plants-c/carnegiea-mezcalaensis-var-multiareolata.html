                    <h1>Carnegiea mezcalaensis var. multiareolata</h1>
<p>Carnegiea mezcalaensis var. multiareolata, commonly known as the multiareolata variant of the Mexican barrel cactus, is a distinctive species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and a spiny, glochidiate covering. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its areoles, which are the small, raised structures from which spines and flowers emerge, are notably clustered and give it its specific name.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
