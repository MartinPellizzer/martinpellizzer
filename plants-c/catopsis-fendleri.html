<p>Catopsis fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, helping it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Catopsis fendleri is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indirect light and minimal water.</p>
