                    <h1>Cyperus tenax var. sabulicola</h1>
<p>Cyperus tenax var. sabulicola, commonly known as sand flats sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or brackish habitats, such as marshes, tidal flats, and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers.
