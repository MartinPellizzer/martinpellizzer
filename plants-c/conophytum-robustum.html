<p>Conophytum robustum, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, barrel-shaped stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Conophytum robustum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
