                    <h1>Chaetogastra lasiophylla</h1>
<p>Chaetogastra lasiophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, giving it its scientific name "lasiophylla," meaning "rough leaves.". The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive as a partial parasite.</p>
