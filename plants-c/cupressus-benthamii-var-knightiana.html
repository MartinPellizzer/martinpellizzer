The plant produces small, spherical cones and has scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
