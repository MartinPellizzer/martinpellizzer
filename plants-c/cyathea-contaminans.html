                    <h1>Cyathea contaminans</h1>
<p>Cyathea contaminans, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody rhizome that serves as a base for the fronds and helps anchor it to trees or rocks. Cyathea contaminans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of other plants.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to form dense foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
