                    <h1>Cheirinia syrticola</h1>
<p>Cheirinia syrticola, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fibrous stems were historically used by local communities for making ropes and textiles.</p>
<p>Cheirinia syrticola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
