<p>Cladium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine sawgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and inland swampy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cladium philippinense plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
