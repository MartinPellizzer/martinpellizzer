                    <h1>Ceratolacis pedunculatum</h1>
<p>Ceratolacis pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered horned lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive growth pattern with clustered, horn-like structures that give it its common name. The thallus is typically greenish-gray, with a dense, velvety surface that helps it retain moisture. It often grows on tree trunks and soil in temperate forests, forming symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for environmental conditions, reflecting air quality and humidity levels in its habitat.</p>
