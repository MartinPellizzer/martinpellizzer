<p>Coniandra pinnatisecta, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are deeply pinnatisected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses.</p>
