<p>Chilocarpus malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological value, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
