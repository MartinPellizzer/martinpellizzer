                    <h1>Chamaeraphis setosa var. macrostachya</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis setosa var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stemmed glassworts, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal mudflats and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, opposite leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often reddish in color.</p>
