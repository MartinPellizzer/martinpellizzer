<p>Cousinia trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Cousinia trachyphylla is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing fragile ecosystems.</p>
