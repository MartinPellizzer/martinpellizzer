<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 1.5 meters, characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
