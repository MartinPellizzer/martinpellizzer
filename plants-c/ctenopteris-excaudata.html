<p>Ctenopteris excaudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
