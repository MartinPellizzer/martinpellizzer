                    <h1>Carex incurva var. arctica</h1>
<p>Carex incurva var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and often covered with a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh climates.</p>
