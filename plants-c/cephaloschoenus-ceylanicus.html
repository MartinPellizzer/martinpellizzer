                    <h1>Cephaloschoenus ceylanicus</h1>
<p>Cephaloschoenus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form a dense network beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The Ceylon water fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
