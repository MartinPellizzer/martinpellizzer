                    <h1>Centaurea lutea</h1>
<p>Centaurea lutea, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are surrounded by spiny, blue to purple bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Centaurea lutea is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
