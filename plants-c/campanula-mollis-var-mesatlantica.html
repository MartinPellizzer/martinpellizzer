                    <h1>Campanula mollis var. mesatlantica</h1>
<p>Campanula mollis var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, often with a waxy coating to withstand maritime conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal meadows.</p>
