<p>Calceolaria arachnoidea subsp.</p>
<p>nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink or white, with intricate patterns resembling lace.</p>
