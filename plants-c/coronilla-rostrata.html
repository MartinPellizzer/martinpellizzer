<p>Coronilla rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
