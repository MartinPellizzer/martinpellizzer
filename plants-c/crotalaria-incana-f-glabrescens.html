                    <h1>Crotalaria incana f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Crotalaria incana f. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf cowpea, is a variant of the Crotalaria genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, though the 'glabrescens' form is generally less hairy than the typical species. The plant produces yellow, spurred flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in oblong, leathery pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a potential forage plant in certain environments.</p>
