                    <h1>Cuscuta boldinghii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta boldinghii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
