                    <h1>Convolvulus praelongus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and can persist in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Convolvulus praelongus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly in disturbed soils.</p>
