                    <h1>Ceropegia nephroloba</h1>
<p>Ceropegia nephroloba, commonly known as the kidney-leafed ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are often green with a bluish tinge, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
