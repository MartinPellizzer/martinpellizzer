                    <h1>Callisia elegans</h1>
<p>Callisia elegans, commonly known as the silver spider plant, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features trailing stems with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Callisia elegans is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing growth habit.</p>
