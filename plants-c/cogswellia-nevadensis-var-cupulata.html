                    <h1>Cogswellia nevadensis var. cupulata</h1>
<p>Cogswellia nevadensis var. cupulata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the high elevations of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in rocky soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
