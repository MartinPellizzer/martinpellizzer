                    <h1>Clidemia clandestina</h1>
<p>Clidemia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. Its berries are small and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
