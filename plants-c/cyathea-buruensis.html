<p>Cyathea buruensis, commonly known as the Buru tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the island of Buru in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyathea buruensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
