                    <h1>Clidemia linearis</h1>
<p>Clidemia linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, using its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Clidemia linearis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds, while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
