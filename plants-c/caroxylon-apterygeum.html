                    <h1>Caroxylon apterygeum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon apterygeum, commonly known as the desert shrub or desert sage, is a low-growing, woody plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Caroxylon apterygeum is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
