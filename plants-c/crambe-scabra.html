<p>Crambe scabra, commonly known as rough crambe, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Crambe scabra is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has been studied for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high oil content.</p>
