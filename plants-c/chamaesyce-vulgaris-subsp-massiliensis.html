<p>Chamaesyce vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in dry gardens.</p>
