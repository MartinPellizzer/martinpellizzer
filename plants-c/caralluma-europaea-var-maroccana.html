                    <h1>Caralluma europaea var. maroccana</h1>
<p>Caralluma europaea var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
