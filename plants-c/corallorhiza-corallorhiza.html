<p>Corallorhiza corallorhiza, commonly known as the coralroot orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is found in forested areas across North America. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique structure includes a branched, tuberous root system that attaches to the roots of host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific hosts, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
