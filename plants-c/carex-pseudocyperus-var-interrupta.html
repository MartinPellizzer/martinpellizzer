                    <h1>Carex pseudocyperus var. interrupta</h1>
<p>Carex pseudocyperus var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and somewhat hairy, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
