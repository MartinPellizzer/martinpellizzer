<p>Cephalanthera damasonium subsp.</p>
<p>caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
