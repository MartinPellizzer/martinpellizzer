                    <h1>Cynometra pervilleana</h1>
<p>Cynometra pervilleana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, brown seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
