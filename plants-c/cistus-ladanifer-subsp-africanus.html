<p>Cistus ladanifer subsp.</p>
<p>africanus, commonly known as the African rockrose, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive resinous scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to other Cistus species found in the Mediterranean region but is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
