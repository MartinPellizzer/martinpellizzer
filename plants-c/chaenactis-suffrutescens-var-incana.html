<p>Chaenactis suffrutescens var. incana, commonly known as the woolly mouseear cicutaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is adapted to withstand drought and full sun.</p>
