                    <h1>Coburgia reticulata</h1>
<p>Coburgia reticulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is typically clumping, with each rosette producing new fronds over time.</p>
<p>Coburgia reticulata is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas.</p>
