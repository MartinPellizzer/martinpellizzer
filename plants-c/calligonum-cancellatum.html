                    <h1>Calligonum cancellatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum cancellatum, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and have a rugged texture, adapted for survival in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum cancellatum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
