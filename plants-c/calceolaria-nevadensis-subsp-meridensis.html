<p>Calceolaria nevadensis subsp.</p>
<p>meridensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health.</p>
