                    <h1>Cereus pfeifferi</h1>
<p>Cereus pfeifferi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to its scent and nocturnal blooming pattern.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Cereus pfeifferi is remarkably resilient and can thrive in extreme environments.</p>
