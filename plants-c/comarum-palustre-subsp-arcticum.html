<p>Comarum palustre subsp.</p>
<p>arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in wet, boggy environments and has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
