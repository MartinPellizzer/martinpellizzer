<p>Coelogyne sulawesiensis, commonly known as the Sulawesi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and green coloration.

Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the wet season, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
