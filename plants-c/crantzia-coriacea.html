                    <h1>Crantzia coriacea</h1>
<p>Crantzia coriacea, commonly known as coastal crantzia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in coastal gardens.</p>
