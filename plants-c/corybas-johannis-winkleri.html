<p>Corybas johannis-winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's helmet orchid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that resembles a small, closed cup. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rainforest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually dark in color, ranging from deep purple to black, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
