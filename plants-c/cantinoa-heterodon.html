                    <h1>Cantinoa heterodon</h1>
<p>Cantinoa heterodon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, white, and often translucent leaves that give it its ethereal appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Cantinoa heterodon is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
