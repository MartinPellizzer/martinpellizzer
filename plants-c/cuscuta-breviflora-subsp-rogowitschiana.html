<p>Cuscuta breviflora subsp.</p>
<p>rogowitschiana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often covering its host quickly.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to parts of Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
