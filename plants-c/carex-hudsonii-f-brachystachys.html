<p>Carex hudsonii f. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of closely packed spikes, with the lower spike often shorter than the upper one, a trait that defines the 'brachystachys' form.</p>
