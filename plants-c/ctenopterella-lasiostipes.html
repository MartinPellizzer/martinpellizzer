<p>Ctenopterella lasiostipes, commonly known as the hairy feather fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ctenopterella lasiostipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities.</p>
