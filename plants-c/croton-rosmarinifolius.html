                    <h1>Croton rosmarinifolius</h1>
<p>Croton rosmarinifolius, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved croton, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, spiky seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
