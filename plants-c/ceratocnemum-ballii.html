                    <h1>Ceratocnemum ballii</h1>
<p>Ceratocnemum ballii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind pollination. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ceratocnemum ballii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
