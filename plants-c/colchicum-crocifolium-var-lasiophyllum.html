                    <h1>Colchicum crocifolium var. lasiophyllum</h1>
<p>Colchicum crocifolium var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the woolly autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. Its flowers consist of six petal-like segments that form a cup-shaped structure, with a central spathaceous structure that houses the true flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust foliage and slightly different flowering behavior compared to the typical form of Colchicum crocifolium.</p>
