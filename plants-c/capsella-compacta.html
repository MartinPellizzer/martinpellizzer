<p>Capsella compacta, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, compact rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed pod that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Capsella compacta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
