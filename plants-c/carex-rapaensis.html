<p>Carex rapaensis, commonly known as the Rapa Island sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the remote Rapa Island in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, Carex rapaensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
