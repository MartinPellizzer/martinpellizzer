                    <h1>Cochlearia arctica var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Cochlearia arctica var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the Arctic horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and oblong, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger, more elongated leaves compared to other Cochlearia species.</p>
