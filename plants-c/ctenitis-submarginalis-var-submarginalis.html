                    <h1>Ctenitis submarginalis var. submarginalis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis submarginalis var. submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
