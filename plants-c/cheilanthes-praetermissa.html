                    <h1>Cheilanthes praetermissa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes praetermissa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern with a rosette-like arrangement of leathery, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or granite.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry landscapes.</p>
