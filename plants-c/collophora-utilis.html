                    <h1>Collophora utilis</h1>
<p>Collophora utilis, commonly known as the useful lichen, is a crustose lichen that grows on bark and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Collemataceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi for nutrition. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
