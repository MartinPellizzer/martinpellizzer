                    <h1>Chamaesyce torralbasii</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce torralbasii, commonly known as the Torralbas's sandmat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of yellow or green, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce torralbasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes.</p>
