                    <h1>Cirsium maackii var. vulcani</h1>
<p>Cirsium maackii var. vulcani, commonly known as the Maack's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and upright, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with rough, hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
