                    <h1>Callitropsis funebris</h1>
<p>Callitropsis funebris, commonly known as the mourning pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and a conical shape that gives it a somber appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the coniferous family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Callitropsis funebris is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
