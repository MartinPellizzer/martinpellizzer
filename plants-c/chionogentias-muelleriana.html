                    <h1>Chionogentias muelleriana</h1>
<p>Chionogentias muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale blue, bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the snowy landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
