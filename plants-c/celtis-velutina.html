<p>Celtis velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree or silky tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to reveal three to four seeds. Celtis velutina is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals.</p>
