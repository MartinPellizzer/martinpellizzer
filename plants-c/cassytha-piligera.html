                    <h1>Cassytha piligera</h1>
<p>Cassytha piligera, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has slender, twining stems that can cover large areas. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies entirely on its hosts for survival.</p>
<p>Cassytha piligera is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
