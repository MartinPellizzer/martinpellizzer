                    <h1>Cyclosorus oppositipinnus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus oppositipinnus, commonly known as the opposite-pinnate cyclosorus, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are arranged in an opposite-pinnate pattern, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus oppositipinnus is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
