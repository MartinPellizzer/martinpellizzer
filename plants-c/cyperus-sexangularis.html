                    <h1>Cyperus sexangularis</h1>
<p>Cyperus sexangularis, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Cyperus sexangularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
