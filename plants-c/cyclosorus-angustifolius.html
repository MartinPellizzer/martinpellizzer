<p>Cyclosorus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cyclosorus, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
