<p>Colobanthus squarrosus subsp.</p>
<p>drucei, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
