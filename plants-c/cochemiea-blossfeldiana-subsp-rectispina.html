<p>Cochemiea blossfeldiana subsp.</p>
<p>rectispina, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and clusters of white, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring.</p>

<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
