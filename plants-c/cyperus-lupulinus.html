                    <h1>Cyperus lupulinus</h1>
<p>Cyperus lupulinus, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread in moist environments. Cyperus lupulinus thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions contributes to its ecological versatility.</p>
