                    <h1>Cyperus laetus var. elatior</h1>
<p>Cyperus laetus var. elatior, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential weed in aquatic habitats.</p>
