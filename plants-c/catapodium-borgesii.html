<p>Catapodium borgesii, commonly known as the desert grass or borge's catapodium, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
