                    <h1>Carex pallescens var. subsilvatica</h1>
<p>Carex pallescens var. subsilvatica, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist forested areas of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its pale green to silver-gray foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
