<p>Calandrinia liniflora, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
