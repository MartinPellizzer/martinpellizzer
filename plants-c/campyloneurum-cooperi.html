<p>Campyloneurum cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its flat, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid growth form, with a distinct upper and lower surface that is often covered in small, rounded structures called gemmae. It thrives in rocky or soil substrates, often in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying bryophyte diversity and adaptation.</p>
