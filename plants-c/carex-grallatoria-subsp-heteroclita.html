                    <h1>Carex grallatoria subsp. heteroclita</h1>
<p>Carex grallatoria subsp.</p>
<p>heteroclita, commonly known as the heterogeneous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its morphological variations, particularly in leaf and inflorescence structures compared to other Carex species.</p>
