                    <h1>Calyptranthes tessmannii</h1>
<p>Calyptranthes tessmannii, commonly known as the mossy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, using haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
