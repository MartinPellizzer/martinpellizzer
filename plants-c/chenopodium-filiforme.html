                    <h1>Chenopodium filiforme</h1>
<p>Chenopodium filiforme, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, thread-like stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
