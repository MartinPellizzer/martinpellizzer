<p>congesta, commonly known as the marsh cineraria, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in damp, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for wetland biodiversity.</p>
