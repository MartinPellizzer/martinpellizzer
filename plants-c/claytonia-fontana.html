                    <h1>Claytonia fontana</h1>
<p>Claytonia fontana, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to wetland and clay-rich soils.</p>
