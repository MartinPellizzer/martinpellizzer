                    <h1>Calligonum alatum var. involutum</h1>
<p>Calligonum alatum var. involutum, commonly known as the curled saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, leaf-like stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline conditions, making it an important component of desert and steppe ecosystems.</p>
