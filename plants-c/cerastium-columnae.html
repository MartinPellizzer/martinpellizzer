<p>Cerastium columnae, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
