                    <h1>Chamaecladon ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Chamaecladon ovalifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chamaecladon, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, clustered manner. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of its branches. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens.</p>
