                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. longiloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. longiloba, commonly known as the longstem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white to yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to California and thrives in dry, disturbed habitats. It is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and lack of roots make it a unique and sometimes invasive species in its ecosystem.</p>
