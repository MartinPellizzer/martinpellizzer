                    <h1>Cactus fascicularis</h1>
<p>Cactus fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical or slightly branched stems, which are often covered in spines for protection. The plant produces yellow or white flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring or summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus fascicularis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
