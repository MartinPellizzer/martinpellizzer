                    <h1>Cerastium dasyphyllum</h1>
<p>Cerastium dasyphyllum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
