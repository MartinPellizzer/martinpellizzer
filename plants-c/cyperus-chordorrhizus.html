<p>Cyperus chordorrhizus, commonly known as the threadroot sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Cyperus chordorrhizus is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
