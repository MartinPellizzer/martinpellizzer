                    <h1>Culcitium karstenii</h1>
<p>Culcitium karstenii, commonly known as the Karstenâ€™s culcitium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
