<p>Cousinia egregia, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia egregia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
