<p>Cattleya nevesiana, commonly known as the Nevesian orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, with a distinctive red lip. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cattleya nevesiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display.</p>
