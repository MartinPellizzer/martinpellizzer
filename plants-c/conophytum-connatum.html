<p>Conophytum connatum, commonly known as the "Cape Hareâ€™s foot," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum connatum is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
