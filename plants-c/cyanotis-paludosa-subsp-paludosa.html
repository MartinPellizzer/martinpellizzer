<p>Cyanotis paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for aquatic insects and as an indicator of wetland health.</p>
