The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Cephaloseris species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa.</p>
<p>They are adapted to survive in harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and deep root systems.</p>
