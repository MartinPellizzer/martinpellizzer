                    <h1>Ctenopteris circumvallata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris circumvallata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is more commonly observed in related ferns.</p>
