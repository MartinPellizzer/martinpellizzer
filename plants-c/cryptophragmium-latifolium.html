                    <h1>Cryptophragmium latifolium</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cryptophragmium, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often clustered growth habit.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broad and flat, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range.</p>
