<p>Campanula algida, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Campanula algida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
