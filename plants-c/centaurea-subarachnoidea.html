                    <h1>Centaurea subarachnoidea</h1>
<p>Centaurea subarachnoidea, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Centaurea subarachnoidea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
