<p>Callitriche palustris subsp.</p>
<p>pedunculata, commonly known as the aquatic starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters and can form dense mats on the waterâ€™s surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support its flowering stems above the water.</p>
