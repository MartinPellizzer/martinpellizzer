                    <h1>Citrus × nipis</h1>
<p>Citrus × nipis, commonly known as the kaffir lime.</p>
<p>This hybrid citrus plant is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its aromatic, rough, and segmented green fruit. The fruit has a distinctively wrinkled rind and a strong, pungent aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils. It is widely used in culinary applications, particularly in Thai and other Southeast Asian cuisines.</p>
<p>The plant is typically grown for its fruit rather than its juice, as the pulp is less acidic and more aromatic compared to other citrus varieties.</p>
