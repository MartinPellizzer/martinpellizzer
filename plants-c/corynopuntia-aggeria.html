                    <h1>Corynopuntia aggeria</h1>
<p>Corynopuntia aggeria, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Its root system is adapted to absorb water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Corynopuntia aggeria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
