                    <h1>Carex pilulifera var. bastardiana</h1>
<p>Carex pilulifera var. bastardiana, commonly known as the bastard sedge, is a variant of the sedge genus Carex native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikes, a feature common in many sedges.</p>
