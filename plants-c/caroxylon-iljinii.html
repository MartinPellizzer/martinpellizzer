                    <h1>Caroxylon iljinii</h1>
<p>Caroxylon iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's carob tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, though it is less commonly cultivated than other carob species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon iljinii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
