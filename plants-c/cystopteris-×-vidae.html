                    <h1>Cystopteris × vidae</h1>
<p>Cystopteris × vidae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species that results from the cross between Cystopteris bulbifera and Cystopteris fragilis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant.</p>
