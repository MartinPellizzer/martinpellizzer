<p>Clermontia samuelii subsp.</p>
<p>hanaensis, commonly known as Hana Mountain ginger, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, dark red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforest understories and streamside areas. It has lance-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
