<p>Collania andimarcana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collania andimarcana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
