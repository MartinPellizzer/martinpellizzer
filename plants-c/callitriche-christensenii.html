<p>Callitriche christensenii, commonly known as the Christensen's water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its slender, branching stems. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in moist, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
