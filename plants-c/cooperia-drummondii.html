                    <h1>Cooperia drummondii</h1>
<p>Cooperia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's cooperia, is a species of grass found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Cooperia drummondii is often found in association with other native grasses in dryland ecosystems.</p>
