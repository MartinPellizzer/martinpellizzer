                    <h1>Corispermum macrocarpum var. rubrum</h1>
<p>Corispermum macrocarpum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red-seeded sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, red, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
