<p>Cycas cantafolia, commonly known as the Borneo cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a thick, waxy texture that helps it survive in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Cycas cantafolia is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 280 million years.</p>
