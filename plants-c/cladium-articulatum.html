                    <h1>Cladium articulatum</h1>
<p>Cladium articulatum, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor the plant in the muddy substrate.</p>
<p>Sawgrass plays a crucial role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
