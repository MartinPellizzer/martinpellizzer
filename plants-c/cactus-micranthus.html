                    <h1>Cactus micranthus</h1>
<p>Cactus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus micranthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
