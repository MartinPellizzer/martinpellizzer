                    <h1>Cyperus pohlii</h1>
<p>Cyperus pohlii, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, spirally arranged leaves that help it float on the water's surface while anchoring itself to the substrate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus pohlii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
