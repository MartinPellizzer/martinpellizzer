                    <h1>Carex buxbaumii subsp. mutica</h1>
<p>Carex buxbaumii subsp.</p>
<p>mutica, commonly known as the Buxbaumâ€™s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The subspecies mutica is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of C. buxbaumii.</p>
