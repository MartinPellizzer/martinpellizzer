                    <h1>Cardamine nivea</h1>
<p>Cardamine nivea, commonly known as the snowdrop fern or white water-cress, is a delicate perennial herb native to cool, moist environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wet, shaded habitats. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems, forming dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Cardamine nivea is often found in stream banks, woodland floors, and rocky crevices where it thrives in partial shade and consistent moisture.</p>
