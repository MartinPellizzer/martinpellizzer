<p>Crepis foetida subsp.</p>
<p>glandulosa, commonly known as the stinking hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and spiky, bract-covered seed heads.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The subspecies glandulosa is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of these glandular structures.</p>
