<p>Cymbocarpum marginatum, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cymbocarpum marginatum is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
