                    <h1>Cyphomandra macrophylla</h1>
<p>Cyphomandra macrophylla, commonly known as the giant purple potato, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet flowers. The plant produces tubers that are often larger than those of the common potato, though they are not typically cultivated for food.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its robust growth habit and its role in the evolution of cultivated potatoes.</p>
