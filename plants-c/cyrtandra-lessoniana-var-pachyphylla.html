                    <h1>Cyrtandra lessoniana var. pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Cyrtandra lessoniana var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved cyrtandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid coastal habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by native pollinators. It grows primarily in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
