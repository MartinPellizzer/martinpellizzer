<p>Cyathea kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea kuhnii typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and facilitates the absorption of nutrients from the soil.</p>
