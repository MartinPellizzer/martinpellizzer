                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. gracilis, commonly known as slender water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetlands.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
