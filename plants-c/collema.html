                    <h1>Collema</h1>
<p>Collema, commonly known as the "liverwort moss," is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green or yellowish in color. Collema species often grow in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions. The plant's structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an important component of many ecosystems.</p>
