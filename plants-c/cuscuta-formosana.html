                    <h1>Cuscuta formosana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta formosana, commonly known as the Taiwanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia, including Taiwan, and is often found on various host species such as grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
