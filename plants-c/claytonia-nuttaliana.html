<p>Claytonia nuttaliana, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
