<p>Correlliana chamaephyta, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its wetland habitat.</p>
