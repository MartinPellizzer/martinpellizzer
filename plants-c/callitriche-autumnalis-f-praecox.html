<p>Callitriche autumnalis f. praecox, commonly known as early water starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, and is characterized by its small, floating or submerged leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often clustered in groups of three, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common sight in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
