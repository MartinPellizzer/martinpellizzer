                    <h1>Cordia passa</h1>
<p>Cordia passa, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany or red cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia passa is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss.</p>
