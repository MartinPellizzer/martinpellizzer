                    <h1>Cuscuta pulchella var. afghana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pulchella var. afghana, commonly known as the Afghan dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, thread-like stem that wraps around its host plant. The plant is native to regions of Central and South Asia, including Afghanistan, and is often found on various herbaceous plants. It has a short life cycle, flowering and setting seed within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
