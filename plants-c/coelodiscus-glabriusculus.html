                    <h1>Coelodiscus glabriusculus</h1>
<p>Coelodiscus glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced sand mat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
