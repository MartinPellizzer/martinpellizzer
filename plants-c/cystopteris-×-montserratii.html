                    <h1>Cystopteris × montserratii</h1>
<p>Cystopteris × montserratii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Caribbean, particularly Montserrat.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
