                    <h1>Cactus purpureus</h1>
<p>Cactus purpureus, commonly known as the purple cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant purple flowers, typically during the spring or early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its spiny exterior provides protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>Cactus purpureus plays an important ecological role by offering shelter and food to various desert animals.</p>
