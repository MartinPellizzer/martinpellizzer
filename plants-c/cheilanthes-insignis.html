                    <h1>Cheilanthes insignis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes insignis, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes insignis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in harsh environments.</p>
