<p>Carex minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the plant.
