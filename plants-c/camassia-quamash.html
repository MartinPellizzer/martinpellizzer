<p>Camassia quamash, commonly known as camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often forming dense clumps. Its leaves are long and grass-like, and it produces edible bulbs that have been historically harvested by Indigenous peoples.</p>
