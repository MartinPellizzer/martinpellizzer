                    <h1>Cenchrus ciliaris f. rigidifolius</h1>
<p>Cenchrus ciliaris f. rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf buffalo grass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to warm climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
