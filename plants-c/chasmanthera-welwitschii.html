<p>Chasmanthera welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest surviving seed plant species, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and a single or multiple pairs of large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It has adapted to extreme arid conditions by developing a deep root system and a CAM photosynthetic pathway to conserve water.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology and resilience make it a significant subject in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
