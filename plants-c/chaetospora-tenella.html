<p>Chaetospora tenella, commonly known as the slender thread moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often curved and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophytes are short and have a single, elongated capsule that opens by a longitudinal slit.</p>
<p>Chaetospora tenella is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
