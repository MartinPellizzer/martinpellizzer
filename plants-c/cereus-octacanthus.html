                    <h1>Cereus octacanthus</h1>
<p>Cereus octacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
