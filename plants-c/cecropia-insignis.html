                    <h1>Cecropia insignis</h1>
<p>Cecropia insignis, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which provide stability in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has large, palmate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its rapid spread in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Cecropia insignis plays an important ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and facilitating forest regeneration.</p>
