                    <h1>Cedrela paraguariensis var. hassleri</h1>
<p>Cedrela paraguariensis var. hassleri, commonly known as the Paraguayan rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions.</p>
