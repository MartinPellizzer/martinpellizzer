<p>Castilleja rhizomata, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It possesses a short, rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients from its host plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble brush strokes, hence its common name. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies.</p>
<p>Castilleja rhizomata plays an important ecological role by influencing the composition of plant communities through its parasitic relationships.</p>
