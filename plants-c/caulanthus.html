                    <h1>Caulanthus</h1>
<p>Caulanthus, commonly known as the "meadow vetchling," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Caulanthus species are often short-lived annuals or biennials, and they play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 50 species, many of which are adapted to temperate climates.</p>
