                    <h1>Crocus zohrabii</h1>
<p>Crocus zohrabii, commonly known as the Zohrab's crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Iraq, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are small and adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
