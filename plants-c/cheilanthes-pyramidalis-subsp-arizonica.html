<p>Cheilanthes pyramidalis subsp.</p>
<p>arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona cliff brake, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
