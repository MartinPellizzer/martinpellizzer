                    <h1>Celastrus aphyllus</h1>
<p>Celastrus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless bindweed, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with instead modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
