<p>Cylicomorpha parviflora var. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stemmed sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
