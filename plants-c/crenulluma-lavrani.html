                    <h1>Crenulluma lavrani</h1>
<p>Crenulluma lavrani, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its unique thallus structure.</p>
<p>It forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Its chemical composition includes secondary metabolites that aid in protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Crenulluma lavrani plays a significant role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in rocky habitats.</p>
