                    <h1>Cyrtogonium crispatulum</h1>
<p>Cyrtogonium crispatulum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a delicate and rare aquatic fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyrtogonium crispatulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
