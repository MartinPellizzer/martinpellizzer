                    <h1>Cephalophyllum baylissii</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum baylissii, commonly known as the baylissii sunflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, large, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers, with tightly packed ray florets surrounding a central disc. Native to the high Andes of Peru, this plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophyllum baylissii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
