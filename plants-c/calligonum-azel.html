<p>Calligonum azel, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Calligonum azel is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments.</p>
