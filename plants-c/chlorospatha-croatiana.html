<p>Chlorospatha croatiana, commonly known as the Croatian green fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Croatia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Chlorospatha croatiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
