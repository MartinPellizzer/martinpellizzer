                    <h1>Cypripedium × delicatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × delicatum, commonly known as the fragrant lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a long, slender rhizome. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
