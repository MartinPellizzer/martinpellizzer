                    <h1>Corybas epiphyticus</h1>
<p>Corybas epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, hood-like structure. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
