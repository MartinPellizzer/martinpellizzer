                    <h1>Cactus elongatus</h1>
<p>Cactus elongatus, commonly known as the slender cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, adapted for storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant has spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or white, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
