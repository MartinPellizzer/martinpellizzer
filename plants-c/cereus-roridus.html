<p>Cereus roridus, commonly known as the rainy night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
<p>Cereus roridus is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
