<p>Cornopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rice paddies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal to new aquatic habitats.</p>
