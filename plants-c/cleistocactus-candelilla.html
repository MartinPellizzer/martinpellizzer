                    <h1>Cleistocactus candelilla</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus candelilla, commonly known as the candle bush, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus candelilla is also valued for its historical use in traditional practices and as a source of natural wax.</p>
