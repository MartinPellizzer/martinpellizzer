<p>Cephalosorus leptocladus, commonly known as the slender-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cephalosorus leptocladus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
