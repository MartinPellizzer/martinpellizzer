<p>Cereus vargasianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and open only during the evening hours.</p>
<p>Cereus vargasianus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking floral display.</p>
