<p>Ceropegia pallens, commonly known as the silver leaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems and waxy, silver-green leaves that reflect light, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Ceropegia pallens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
