<p>Cissus macropa, commonly known as the large-leafed arrowroot or the climbing devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits that turn red when mature. Its stems are woody and can climb using adventitious roots, allowing it to grow along trees or walls.</p>
<p>Cissus macropa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
