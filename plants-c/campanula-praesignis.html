                    <h1>Campanula praesignis</h1>
<p>Campanula praesignis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Campanula praesignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine environments.</p>
