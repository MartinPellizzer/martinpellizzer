                    <h1>Candollea subvaginata</h1>
<p>Candollea subvaginata, commonly known as the narrow sheath fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, supporting the growth of its pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
