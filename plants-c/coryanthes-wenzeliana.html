                    <h1>Coryanthes wenzeliana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes wenzeliana, commonly known as the Wenzel's pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often colorful inflorescences that resemble pitchers, which are used to trap insects. The plant's flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that includes a nectar-secreting lid and a slippery inner surface to aid in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to maintain its delicate structure.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
