<p>Corrigiola crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry gardens.</p>
