                    <h1>Cyathea acanthopoda</h1>
<p>Cyathea acanthopoda, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, compound fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Cyathea acanthopoda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
