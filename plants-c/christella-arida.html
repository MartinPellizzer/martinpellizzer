<p>Christella arida, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Christella arida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
