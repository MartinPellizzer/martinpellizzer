                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris nylandica</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris nylandica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers and hairy, alternate leaves that are typically oval or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, round, seed-containing pods that are often referred to as "purses" due to their shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, gardens, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
