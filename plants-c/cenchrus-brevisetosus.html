                    <h1>Cenchrus brevisetosus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus brevisetosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy soils with low moisture availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
