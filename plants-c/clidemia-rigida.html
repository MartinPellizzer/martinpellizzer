                    <h1>Clidemia rigida</h1>
<p>Clidemia rigida, commonly known as roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Clidemia rigida plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects, although it can also negatively impact its host trees by drawing nutrients and water.</p>
