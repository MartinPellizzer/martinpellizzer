<p>Cystopteris pellucida, commonly known as the translucent water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
