                    <h1>Carex infuscata var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Carex infuscata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to wet conditions.</p>
