                    <h1>Cereus virens</h1>
<p>Cereus virens, commonly known as the green night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus virens thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
