<p>Ceradenia dendrodoxa, commonly known as the tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
