                    <h1>Cicuta sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Cicuta sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant native to the Far East, including regions of Russia and Japan. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters. It is particularly dangerous due to its highly toxic sap and seeds, which contain cicutoxin.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes found in wetland areas and can be mistaken for edible plants.</p>
