<p>Clusianthemum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough clusia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas where it can tolerate saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
