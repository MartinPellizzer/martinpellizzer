                    <h1>Castilleja vreelandii</h1>
<p>Castilleja vreelandii, commonly known as Vreeland's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense spikes, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja vreelandii plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the biodiversity found in arid ecosystems.</p>
