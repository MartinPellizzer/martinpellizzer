<p>Caricinella rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
