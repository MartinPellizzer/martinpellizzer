                            <h1>Catha Articulata</h1>
<p>Khat, scientifically known as Catha articulata, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is widely cultivated for its stimulant properties, with its leaves being chewed or brewed into a tea. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids such as cathine and cathinone, which contribute to its stimulating effects. Due to its psychoactive nature, Khat has been classified as a controlled substance in many countries. Despite legal restrictions, it remains culturally significant in certain regions where it is traditionally used for social and ceremonial purposes.</p>
