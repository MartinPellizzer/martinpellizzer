                    <h1>Cajuputi pubescens</h1>
<p>Cajuputi pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soil and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and covered with fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cajuputi pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
