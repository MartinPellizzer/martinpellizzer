                    <h1>Caropodium haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Caropodium haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausseckner's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls around its slender, branching stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Caropodium haussknechtii is primarily found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it prefers shallow, nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
