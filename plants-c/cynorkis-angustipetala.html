<p>Cynorkis angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
