<p>Cyathea ramisora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea ramisora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and growth pattern make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
