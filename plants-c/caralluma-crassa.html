                    <h1>Caralluma crassa</h1>
<p>Caralluma crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma crassa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
