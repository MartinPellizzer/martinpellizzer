                    <h1>Cyclea scyphigera</h1>
<p>Cyclea scyphigera, commonly known as the "Cape gooseberry" or "physic nut," is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits resembling tiny tomatoes, which contain a single large seed. Cyclea scyphigera is notable for its medicinal properties, with the fruit being used in traditional medicine for its laxative and antispasmodic effects.</p>
<p>However, the plant is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
