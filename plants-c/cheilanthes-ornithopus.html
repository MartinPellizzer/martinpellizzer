                    <h1>Cheilanthes ornithopus</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's beak fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a rosette of leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. Its unique leaf shape resembles a bird's beak, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes ornithopus is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
