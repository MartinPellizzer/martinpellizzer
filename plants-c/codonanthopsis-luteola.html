The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
