                    <h1>Cyperus lacustris</h1>
<p>Cyperus lacustris, commonly known as the water papyrus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus lacustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing shoreline soils.</p>
