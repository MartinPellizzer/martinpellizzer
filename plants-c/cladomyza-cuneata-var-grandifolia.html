                    <h1>Cladomyza cuneata var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Cladomyza cuneata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leafed cliffweed, is a variant of the Cladomyza cuneata species native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
