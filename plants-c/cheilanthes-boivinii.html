<p>Cheilanthes boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a smooth, glossy surface, and its spores are produced in dense clusters on the underside of the leaves. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, often thriving in crevices and on exposed rock faces.</p>
<p>This fern is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and morphological features.</p>
