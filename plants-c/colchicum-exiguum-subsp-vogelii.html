<p>Colchicum exiguum subsp.</p>
<p>vogelii, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Colchicaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which has historically been used in medicine and research.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
