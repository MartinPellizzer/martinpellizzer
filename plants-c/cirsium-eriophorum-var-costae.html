<p>It features a rosette of stiff, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear purple to pink flowers with prominent, bristly rays. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
