<p>Cyathea singularis, commonly known as the singular tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyathea singularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, tropical environments.</p>
