<p>Cupaniopsis, commonly known as the ghost gum or cupaniopsis acuata, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often pale green or white foliage. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Cupaniopsis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fruiting structures known as cupules, which give the plant its genus name.</p>
