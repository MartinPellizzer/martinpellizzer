                    <h1>Carpodinus exserens</h1>
<p>Carpodinus exserens, commonly known as the spiral fruit or spiral seed plant, is a unique member of the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped fruits that twist as they mature, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or shaded environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface that reflects light.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Carpodinus exserens lies in its unusual morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
