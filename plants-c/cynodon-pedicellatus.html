<p>Cynodon pedicellatus, commonly known as the slender buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
