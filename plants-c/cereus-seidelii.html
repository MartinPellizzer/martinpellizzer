                    <h1>Cereus seidelii</h1>
<p>Cereus seidelii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Cereus seidelii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
