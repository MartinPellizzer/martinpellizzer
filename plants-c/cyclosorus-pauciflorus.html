                    <h1>Cyclosorus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the undersides of its fertile leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where humidity levels are high.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus pauciflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
