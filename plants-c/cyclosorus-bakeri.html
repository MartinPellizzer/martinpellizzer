                    <h1>Cyclosorus bakeri</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus bakeri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
