                    <h1>Ctenopteris hymenophylloides</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris hymenophylloides, commonly known as the Hymenophylloides fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which is a unique feature among ferns. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
