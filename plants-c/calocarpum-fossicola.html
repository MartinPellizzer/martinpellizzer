                    <h1>Calocarpum fossicola</h1>
<p>Calocarpum fossicola, commonly known as the rock calocarpum, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in rocky and limestone habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
