<p>Caladenia transitoria, commonly known as the transient spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single, slender stem bearing a single, highly fragrant orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its blooming period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it is known for its ephemeral nature, as the flower often fades quickly.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
