<p>Cynorkis kassneriana subsp.</p>
<p>tenuior, commonly known as the slender leaf cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that grow in a dense, compact rosette.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
