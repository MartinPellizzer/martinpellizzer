                    <h1>Cymation</h1>
<p>Cymation, commonly known as the cymose inflorescence, is a type of plant growth pattern characterized by a central axis from which branches arise.</p>
<p>This structure typically forms a compact, rounded shape with flowers or buds at the ends of the branches. In cymation, the terminal bud grows first, followed by lateral buds that develop in a hierarchical manner. This growth pattern is common in many flowering plants, including species like the dandelion and sunflower.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of cymation lies in its role in optimizing light capture and resource allocation in plant development.</p>
