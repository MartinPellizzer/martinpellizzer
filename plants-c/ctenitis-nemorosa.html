                    <h1>Ctenitis nemorosa</h1>
<p>Ctenitis nemorosa, commonly known as the forest holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>Ctenitis nemorosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
