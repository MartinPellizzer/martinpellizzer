                    <h1>Cheilanthes resistens</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes resistens, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a resilient fern native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant features a compact, creeping rhizome system that allows it to colonize crevices and rocky outcrops effectively. Its fronds are typically grayish-green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes resistens plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is a hardy example of xerophytic adaptation.</p>
