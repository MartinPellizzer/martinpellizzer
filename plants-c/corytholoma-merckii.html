<p>Corytholoma merckii, commonly known as the Merck's cupressus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Cupressaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and conical shape, which resemble those of a pine tree. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Corytholoma merckii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
