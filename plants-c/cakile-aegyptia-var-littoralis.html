<p>Cakile aegyptia var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal knotweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
