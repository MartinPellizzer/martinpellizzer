<p>Clermontia kahuaensis, commonly known as the Kahoʻolawe clermonthe, is an endemic plant species found exclusively on the Hawaiian island of Kahoʻolawe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the island. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and ecological significance make it a valuable component of Hawaii's native flora.</p>
