<p>Chondrilla insolens, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chondrilla insolens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
