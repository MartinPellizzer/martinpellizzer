<p>Conophytum corculum, commonly known as the "Crowned Stone" or "Coral Stone," is a member of the Aizoaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant features a short, thick stem covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, are small and borne in clusters, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage.</p>
<p>Conophytum corculum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky outcrops or sandy soils.</p>
