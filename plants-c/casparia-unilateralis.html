<p>Casparia unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided casparia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, with one side of the leaf exhibiting a different coloration or texture compared to the other. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Casparia unilateralis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to plant taxonomists and conservationists.</p>
