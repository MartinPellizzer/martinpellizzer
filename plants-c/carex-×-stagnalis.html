                    <h1>Carex × stagnalis</h1>
<p>Carex × stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, characterized by its grass-like appearance and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of green to brown flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex × stagnalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
