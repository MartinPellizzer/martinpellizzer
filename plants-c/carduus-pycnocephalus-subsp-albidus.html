<p>Carduus pycnocephalus subsp.</p>
<p>albidus, commonly known as the alpine sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiky achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
