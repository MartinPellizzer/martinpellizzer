                    <h1>Colutea arborescens var. nepalensis</h1>
<p>Colutea arborescens var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows as a shrub with branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
