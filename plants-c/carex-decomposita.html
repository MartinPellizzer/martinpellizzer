                    <h1>Carex decomposita</h1>
<p>Carex decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex decomposita plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
