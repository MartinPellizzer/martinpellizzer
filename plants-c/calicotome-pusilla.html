<p>Calicotome pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf burr bush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
