                    <h1>Cyperus hillebrandii var. mauiensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus hillebrandii var. mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
