                    <h1>Cypripedium × buchanianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × buchanianum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-like lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
