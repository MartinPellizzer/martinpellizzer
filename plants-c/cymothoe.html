The larvae of Cymothoe species typically feed on plants in the legume family, such as those in the genus *Pterocarpus*. The plants host to these caterpillars play a crucial role in the life cycle and population dynamics of the genus.</p>
<p>Botanically, the study of these plants helps in understanding the ecological relationships and conservation needs of Cymothoe butterflies.</p>
