<p>Cryptoloma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>

The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Cryptoloma has small, fern-like leaves and produces a mild, aromatic scent that is most noticeable at night.</p>
