                    <h1>Claytonia parviflora var. depressa</h1>
<p>Claytonia parviflora var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender stems rising from the leaf rosette. Its botanical structure is adapted to survive in rocky or sandy soils, with a compact growth form that minimizes exposure to harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Claytonia species and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
