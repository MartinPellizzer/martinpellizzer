                    <h1>Caccinia glauca var. typica</h1>
<p>Caccinia glauca var. typica, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune systems and coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
