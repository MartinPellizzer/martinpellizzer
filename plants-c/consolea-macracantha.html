                <h1>Consolea macracantha</h1>
<p>Consolea macracantha, commonly known as the giant rat-tail cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a distinctive red or orange coloration. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Consolea macracantha is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
