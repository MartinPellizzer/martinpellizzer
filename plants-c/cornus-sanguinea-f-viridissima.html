                    <h1>Cornus sanguinea f. viridissima</h1>
<p>Cornus sanguinea f. viridissima, commonly known as the green-stem dogwood, is a variant of the common dogwood characterized by its distinctive green stems rather than the typical red or yellow hues.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
