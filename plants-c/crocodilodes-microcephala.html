<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and unique, intricate floral structures that resemble miniature crocodiles, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant produces fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of beetles and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native ecosystem.</p>
