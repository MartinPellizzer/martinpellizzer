<p>Cordyline sulcata, commonly known as the mountain cordyline, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy, or sulcate, margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>Cordyline sulcata is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and moderate drought.</p>
