                    <h1>Cheilanthes leucopoda</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes leucopoda, commonly known as the white-haired rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds with a dense covering of white, silky hairs. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes leucopoda is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in full sun and minimal water.</p>
