                    <h1>Cereus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Cereus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfall. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
