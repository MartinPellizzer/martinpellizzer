<p>Calycosia pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy calycosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Calycosia pubiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
