                    <h1>Cereus margaritensis</h1>
<p>Cereus margaritensis, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick base, and it produces white or pink flowers at night. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
