                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris rhombea</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris rhombea, commonly known as the common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, followed by heart-shaped, lobed seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in many regions.</p>
