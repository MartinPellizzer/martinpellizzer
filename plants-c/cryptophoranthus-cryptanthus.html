<p>Cryptophoranthus cryptanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small, ghostly faces, giving it its common name. The plant produces its flowers in dense clusters, often emerging from a basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves. Its botanical features include a short, fibrous root system and a compact growth habit adapted to its harsh, mountainous environment.</p>
<p>Cryptophoranthus cryptanthus is notable for its ephemeral blooming cycle, which occurs during the brief wet season, making it a rare and fascinating species in botanical studies.</p>
