                    <h1>Cuscuta decora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta decora, commonly known as the decorative dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans, causing potential agricultural damage. Its life cycle involves germination from seeds, attachment to a host, and then the development of a complex network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Cuscuta decora is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
