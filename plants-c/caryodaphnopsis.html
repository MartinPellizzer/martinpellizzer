                    <h1>Caryodaphnopsis</h1>
<p>Caryodaphnopsis, commonly known as the golden cupress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves and distinctive, elongated cones that resemble small cups. The plant is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. Caryodaphnopsis has a limited natural range and is considered a relict species, surviving from the Tertiary period.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native habitat.</p>
