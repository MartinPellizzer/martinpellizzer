<p>Cerastium effusum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Cerastium effusum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
