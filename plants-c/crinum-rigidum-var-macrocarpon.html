<p>Crinum rigidum var. macrocarpon, commonly known as the large-fruited crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces striking, fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in summer. Its bulbs are large and fleshy, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
