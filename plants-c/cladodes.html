                    <h1>Cladodes</h1>
<p>Cladodes, commonly known as leaf-like stems, are modified stems that function as leaves in certain plants.</p>
<p>They are typically found in arid environments where water conservation is essential. These structures perform photosynthesis, just like true leaves, and often have a reduced number of stomata to minimize water loss. Cladodes are characteristic of plants such as cacti and some species of euphorbias.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology allows them to thrive in harsh, dry conditions while maximizing light absorption.</p>
