                    <h1>Calycorectes</h1>
<p>Calycorectes, commonly known as the "sac-like flower" or "sac flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, where the calyx and corolla are fused into a single, sac-like structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. Calycorectes species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their specialized morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
