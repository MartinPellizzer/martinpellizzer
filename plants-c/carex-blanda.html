                    <h1>Carex blanda</h1>
<p>Carex blanda, commonly known as smooth bluegrass sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex blanda is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
