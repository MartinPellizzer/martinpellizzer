                    <h1>Calathea nidulans</h1>
<p>Calathea nidulans, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often change color in response to light conditions. The plantâ€™s leaves fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is a unique adaptation for conserving moisture. Calathea nidulans thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
