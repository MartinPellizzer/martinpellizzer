                    <h1>Crenidium spinescens</h1>
<p>Crenidium spinescens, commonly known as the spiny crenidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
