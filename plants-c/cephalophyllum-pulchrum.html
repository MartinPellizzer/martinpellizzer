                    <h1>Cephalophyllum pulchrum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum pulchrum, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or crown-of-thorns cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of spiny, fleshy leaves that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branched stalks. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
