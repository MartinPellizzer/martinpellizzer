<p>Coccocypselum pumilo, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that protects it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly resilient and adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
