                    <h1>Corrigiola telephiifolia var. imbricata</h1>
<p>Corrigiola telephiifolia var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its tightly overlapping leaves, giving it the species name "imbricata," which means "overlapping like tiles.".</p>
