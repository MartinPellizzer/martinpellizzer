                    <h1>Cenchrus brownii</h1>
<p>Cenchrus brownii, commonly known as the brown lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in semi-arid regions.</p>
