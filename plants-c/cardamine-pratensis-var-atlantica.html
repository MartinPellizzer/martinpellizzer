<p>Cardamine pratensis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic watercress, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are pinnately veined and often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
