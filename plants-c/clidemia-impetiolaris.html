                    <h1>Clidemia impetiolaris</h1>
<p>Clidemia impetiolaris, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and has opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii, where it can outcompete native flora.</p>
