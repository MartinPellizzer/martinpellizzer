                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. spadiceus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. spadiceus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, triangular stems with small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of pale purple or brown spikelets. The plant is often found in wet or disturbed soils, such as along waterways, marshes, and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. spadiceus is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
