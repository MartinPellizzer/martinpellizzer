<p>Cerastium kasbek, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Cerastium kasbek is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
