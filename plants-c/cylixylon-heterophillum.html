                    <h1>Cylixylon heterophillum</h1>
<p>Cylixylon heterophillum, commonly known as the silverleaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role contribute to its importance in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
