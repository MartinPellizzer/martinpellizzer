                    <h1>Cyperus ovularis var. robustus</h1>
<p>Cyperus ovularis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils.</p>
