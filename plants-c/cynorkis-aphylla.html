                    <h1>Cynorkis aphylla</h1>
<p>Cynorkis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, which is a rare trait among flowering plants. Instead of leaves, it possesses a slender, leafless stem that supports its single, showy flower. The plant is native to certain regions of Africa and thrives in specific microhabitats with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptations to nutrient-poor environments and its role in ecological studies of plant morphology.</p>
