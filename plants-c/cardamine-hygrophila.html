                    <h1>Cardamine hygrophila</h1>
<p>Cardamine hygrophila, commonly known as water cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in stream banks, marshes, and damp woodlands. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in wet soils and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Cardamine hygrophila is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary use, as it has a peppery flavor similar to garden cress.</p>
