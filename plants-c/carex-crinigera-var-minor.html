                    <h1>Carex crinigera var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex crinigera var. minor, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a sedge species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
