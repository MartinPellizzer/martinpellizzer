<p>Crataegus monogyna f. biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flowers, which have two or more florets per flower head, giving it a more showy appearance than the typical single-flowered form. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>
