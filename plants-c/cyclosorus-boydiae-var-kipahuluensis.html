                    <h1>Cyclosorus boydiae var. kipahuluensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus boydiae var. kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu cyclosorus, is a rare fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
