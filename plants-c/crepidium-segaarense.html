                    <h1>Crepidium segaarense</h1>
<p>Crepidium segaarense, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate, greenish-yellow inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
