                    <h1>Cuscuta fruticum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta fruticum, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. Dodder can infest a wide range of plants, including crops, ornamentals, and wild vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence often weakens the host plant, reducing its growth and yield.</p>
