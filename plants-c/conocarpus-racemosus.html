                    <h1>Conocarpus racemosus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus racemosus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, fleshy, red fruits that contain a single seed. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soil, and it plays a crucial role in coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
