                    <h1>Carphobolus sessiliflorus</h1>
<p>Carphobolus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower grass, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with sessile flowers, meaning the flowers are attached directly to the stem without stalks. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
