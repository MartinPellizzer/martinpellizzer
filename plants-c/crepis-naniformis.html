<p>Crepis naniformis, commonly known as the dwarf hawk's-beard, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitats. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Crepis naniformis is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
