                    <h1>Cereus pentlandii var. marginatus</h1>
<p>Cereus pentlandii var. marginatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink spines and a swollen, rounded stem that often displays a variegated or marginated appearance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a trait common in many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system suited for dry conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'marginatus' refers to the unique coloration patterns along the edges of its stem.</p>
