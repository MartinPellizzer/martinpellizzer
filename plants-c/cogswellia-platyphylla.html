                    <h1>Cogswellia platyphylla</h1>
<p>Cogswellia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, leathery leaves that form a dense rosette around the trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate. Its thick, fibrous trunk helps it store water, adapting it to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat.</p>
