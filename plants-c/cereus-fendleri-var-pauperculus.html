<p>Cereus fendleri var. pauperculus, commonly known as the "Moon Cactus," is a low-growing cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with spiny areoles and produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not a true cactus but a type of euphorbia, which contributes to its distinctive features.</p>
