<p>Cheilanthes ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that are typically less than a foot in length. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and unique morphology make it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
