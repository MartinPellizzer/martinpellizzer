<p>Cirsium jorullense subsp.</p>
<p>lanosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy purple to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage and spiny structure serve as adaptations for deterring herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
