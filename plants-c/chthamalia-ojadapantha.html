<p>Chthamalia ojadapantha, commonly known as the rockweed, is a marine algae belonging to the family Cystophycaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to brown color and its ability to thrive in rocky coastal environments. This species forms dense mats on the seabed, providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms. Chthamalia ojadapantha is typically found in shallow, tide-pool areas where it can absorb nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a thallus with branching filaments, which aid in photosynthesis and attachment to substrates.</p>
