                    <h1>Cyperus setiformis</h1>
<p>Cyperus setiformis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed aquatic areas.</p>
<p>Cyperus setiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
