<p>Cereus calcirupicola subsp.</p>
<p>cabralensis, commonly known as the Cabral's rock cactus, is a species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a ribbed structure that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in xerophytic flora.</p>
