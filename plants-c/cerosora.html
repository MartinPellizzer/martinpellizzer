                    <h1>Cerosora</h1>
<p>Cerosora, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Cerosora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
