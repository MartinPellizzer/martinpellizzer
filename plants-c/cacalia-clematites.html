                    <h1>Cacalia clematites</h1>
<p>Cacalia clematites, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing habit with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Cacalia clematites is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
