                    <h1>Cenchrus latifolius</h1>
<p>Cenchrus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with broad, flat leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its fibrous structure and resilience make it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
