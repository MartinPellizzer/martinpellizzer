<p>Cyperus cuspidatus var. burchellii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, three-lobed flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
