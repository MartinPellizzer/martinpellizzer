                    <h1>Cheilanthes hirta var. watermeyeri</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes hirta var. watermeyeri, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, leathery fronds that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
