<p>Capsella subseleniaca, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Capsella subseleniaca is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat.</p>
