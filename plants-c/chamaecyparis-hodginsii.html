                    <h1>Chamaecyparis hodginsii</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis hodginsii, commonly known as the Townsend's cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and slender, pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It has shallow roots and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
