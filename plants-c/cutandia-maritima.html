<p>Cutandia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats along the shoreline. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Cutandia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal habitats.</p>
