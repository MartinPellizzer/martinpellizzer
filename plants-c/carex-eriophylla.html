<p>Carex eriophylla, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in disturbed or open habitats such as sandy soils or rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Carex eriophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
