                    <h1>Cheirolepis kotschyi</h1>
<p>Cheirolepis kotschyi, commonly known as the mountain cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact, pyramidal growth habit. The plant exhibits remarkable adaptations to cold and arid conditions, including a slow growth rate and thick, waxy foliage. Its cones are small and clustered, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cheirolepis kotschyi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
