                    <h1>Cerasus transarisanensis</h1>
<p>Cerasus transarisanensis, commonly known as the Transarisan cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use.</p>
<p>The Transarisan cherry is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for hybridization with other cherry species.</p>
