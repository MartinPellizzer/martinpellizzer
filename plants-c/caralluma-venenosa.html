                    <h1>Caralluma venenosa</h1>
<p>Caralluma venenosa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, and its leaves are typically reduced to spines. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and rockeries.</p>
