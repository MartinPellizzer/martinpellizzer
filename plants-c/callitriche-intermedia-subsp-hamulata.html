<p>Callitriche intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>hamulata, commonly known as the hooked water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>The plant has small, green flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. Its stems are often branched and can bear small, translucent stipules.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hooked structures on the leaves, which aid in anchoring it in aquatic environments.</p>
