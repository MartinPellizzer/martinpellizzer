                    <h1>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliffbrake, is a fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a narrow, linear shape that gives the plant its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
