                            <h1>Crataegus Cotoneaster</h1>
<p>Common hawthorn, scientifically known as Crataegus cotoneaster, is a versatile shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is widely recognized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink flowers in spring and vibrant red berries in autumn. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. Its historical use in herbal medicine for heart health has earned it a place in traditional remedies. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, making it a plant of both ecological significance and caution.</p>
