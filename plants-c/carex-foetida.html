                    <h1>Carex foetida</h1>
<p>Carex foetida, commonly known as stinking sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Carex foetida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the unpleasant odor emitted by its leaves when crushed.</p>
