                    <h1>Coelogyne carnea var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Coelogyne carnea var. parviflora, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant inflorescences with pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are typically smaller than those of the typical Coelogyne carnea, hence the varietal name *parviflora*, meaning "small-flowered.".</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
