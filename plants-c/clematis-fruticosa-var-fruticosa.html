<p>Clematis fruticosa var. fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly Clematis, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, hooked thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth.</p>
