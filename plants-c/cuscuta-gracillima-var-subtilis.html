                    <h1>Cuscuta gracillima var. subtilis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gracillima var. subtilis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found on various herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of host plants and establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host.</p>
