                <h1>Calonema evanescens</h1>
<p>Calonema evanescens, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, translucent hairs, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calonema evanescens is considered a conservation concern.</p>
