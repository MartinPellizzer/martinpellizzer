                    <h1>Candollea bulbifera</h1>
<p>Candollea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered, bulb-like rhizomes from which its common name is derived. The plant produces fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
