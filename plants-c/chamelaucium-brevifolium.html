<p>Chamelaucium brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce yellow to orange flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils and dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Chamelaucium brevifolium plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is a valuable component of the region's biodiversity.</p>
