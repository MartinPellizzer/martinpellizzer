                    <h1>Campylospermum vogelii</h1>
<p>Campylospermum vogelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
