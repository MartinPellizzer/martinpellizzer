                    <h1>Cerastium vulgatum var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Cerastium vulgatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
