                    <h1>Calcearia kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Calcearia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean star-flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Calceariaceae family and is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats within montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Calcearia kinabaluensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
