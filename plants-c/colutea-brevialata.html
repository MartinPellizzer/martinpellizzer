                    <h1>Colutea brevialata</h1>
<p>Colutea brevialata, commonly known as the short-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
