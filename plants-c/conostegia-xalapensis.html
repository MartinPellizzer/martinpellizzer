<p>Conostegia xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
