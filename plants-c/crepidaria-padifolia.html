<p>Crepidaria padifolia, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Crepidaria padifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
