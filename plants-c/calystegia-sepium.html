                <h1>Calystegia sepium</h1>
<p>Calystegia sepium, commonly known as bindweed, is a climbing vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, persistent root system that allows it to spread aggressively and become invasive in many regions. Its stems are hairy and can twine around other plants or structures.</p>
<p>Calystegia sepium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can form dense mats.</p>
