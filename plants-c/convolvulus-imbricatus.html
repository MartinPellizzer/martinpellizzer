<p>Convolvulus imbricatus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a trailing perennial with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it an effective ground cover.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
