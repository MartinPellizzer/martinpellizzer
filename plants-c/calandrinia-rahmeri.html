<p>Calandrinia rahmeri, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Calandrinia rahmeri is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often found in disturbed or rocky soils.</p>
