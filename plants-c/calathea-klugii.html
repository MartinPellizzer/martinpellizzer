<p>Calathea klugii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns in shades of green, white, and pink. The leaves exhibit nyctinasty, folding upward at night and unfolding in the morning, a trait that gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Calathea klugii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
