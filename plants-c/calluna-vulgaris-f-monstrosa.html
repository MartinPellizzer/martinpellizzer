                    <h1>Calluna vulgaris f. monstrosa</h1>
<p>Calluna vulgaris f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant heather, is a variant of the common heather characterized by its enlarged, showy flowers.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more vigorous growth habit compared to typical Calluna vulgaris, with larger, more clustered blooms that can reach up to 5 cm in diameter. The plant is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in heathlands and moorlands. It produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
