<p>Cyclosorus repandulus, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving water, often in shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
