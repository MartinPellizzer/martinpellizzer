                    <h1>Cycas × multifrondis</h1>
<p>Cycas × multifrondis, commonly known as the multi-leaf cycad, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cycas revoluta and Cycas circinalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a striking, palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in horticultural displays. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as a decorative specimen plant.</p>
