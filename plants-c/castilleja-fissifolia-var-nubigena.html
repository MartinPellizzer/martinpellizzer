<p>Castilleja fissifolia var. nubigena, commonly known as the Sierra redroot.</p>
<p>This variant is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It typically grows in high-elevation habitats, such as open grasslands and rocky slopes, in the western United States. The plant has a reddish stem and produces showy, red or orange flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its ecological niche in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
