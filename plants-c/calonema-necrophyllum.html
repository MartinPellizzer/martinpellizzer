                    <h1>Calonema necrophyllum</h1>
<p>Calonema necrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Ascomycetes, which includes fungi rather than typical ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghost-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Calonema necrophyllum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting various microorganisms.</p>
