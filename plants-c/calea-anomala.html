<p>Calea anomala, commonly known as the "flower of the night," is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It features showy, violet-blue flowers that open at night and close by dawn, a characteristic that gives it its common name. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reflect light and retain moisture. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
<p>Calea anomala is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
