                    <h1>Cynoxylon melanotrichum</h1>
<p>Cynoxylon melanotrichum, commonly known as the black-haired ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, fibrous stems that are highly resistant to fire and drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and extreme climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in restoration projects and as a windbreak in arid landscapes.</p>
