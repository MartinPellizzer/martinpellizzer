<p>Carex echinata subsp.</p>
<p>hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to submerged conditions, making it a common species in marshes, ponds, and stream margins. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems.</p>
