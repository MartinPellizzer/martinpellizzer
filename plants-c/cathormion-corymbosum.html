                    <h1>Cathormion corymbosum</h1>
<p>Cathormion corymbosum, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and its distinctive star-like arrangement of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant features small, waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, rounded form. It produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter.</p>
<p>Cathormion corymbosum is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils.</p>
