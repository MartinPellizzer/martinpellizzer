                    <h1>Cucumis sativus var. ennemis</h1>
<p>Cucumis sativus var. ennemis, commonly known as the enemy cucumber, is a variant of the common cucumber with distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a more elongated and spiky fruit compared to standard cucumbers, with a thicker, often hairy rind. The plant has robust, trailing vines that produce small, yellow flowers, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated due to its aggressive growth habit and reduced commercial appeal.</p>
