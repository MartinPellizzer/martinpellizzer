                    <h1>Cenchrus ciliaris var. pallens</h1>
<p>Cenchrus ciliaris var. pallens, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with silver or pale green, giving it its varietal name "pallens.". Its foliage is typically narrow and blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Buffelgrass is widely used for forage and soil stabilization in regions with poor soil quality.</p>
