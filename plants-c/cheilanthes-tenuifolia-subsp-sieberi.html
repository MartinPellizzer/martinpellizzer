<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>sieberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
