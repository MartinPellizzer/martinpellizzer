<p>Cryptocoryne × lucens, commonly known as the hybrid cryptocoryne, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cryptocoryne balansae and Cryptocoryne wrightii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length, often with a waxy texture and a distinct midrib. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires stable water parameters to prevent stress and leaf decay.</p>
<p>Cryptocoryne × lucens is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
