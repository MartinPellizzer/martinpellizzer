                    <h1>Cycas arenicola</h1>
<p>Cycas arenicola, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a unique species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red sarcotesta, which is an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Cycas arenicola is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
