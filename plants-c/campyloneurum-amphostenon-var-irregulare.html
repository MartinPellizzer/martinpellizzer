                    <h1>Campyloneurum amphostenon var. irregulare</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum amphostenon var. irregulare, commonly known as the irregular fronded water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Campyloneurum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often deeply divided and exhibit a unique branching pattern. This plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, typically in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological niche.</p>
