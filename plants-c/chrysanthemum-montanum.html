<p>Chrysanthemum montanum, commonly known as the mountain chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange, during the late summer and autumn months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
