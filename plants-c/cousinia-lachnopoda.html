<p>Cousinia lachnopoda, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Cousinia lachnopoda plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
