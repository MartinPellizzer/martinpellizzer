                    <h1>Cardamine macrophylla var. sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine macrophylla var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim broad-leaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for water absorption, allowing it to thrive in moist or aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
