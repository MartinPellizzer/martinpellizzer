                    <h1>Coffea liberica var. indeniensis</h1>
<p>Coffea liberica var. indeniensis, commonly known as the Indeniensis Liberica, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the Liberica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is native to the highlands of western Africa, particularly in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia. This plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and can grow to significant heights, often reaching over 10 meters in height. The berries are typically larger than those of other coffee species, and the beans are usually processed through wet methods to enhance flavor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low cultivation, it is considered a rare and valuable species in the coffee world.</p>
