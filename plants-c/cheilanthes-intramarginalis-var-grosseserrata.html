                    <h1>Cheilanthes intramarginalis var. grosseserrata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes intramarginalis var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the broad-toothed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds with serrated margins. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats.</p>
