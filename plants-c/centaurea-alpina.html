<p>Centaurea alpina, commonly known as alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, which are surrounded by red or purple bracts, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Centaurea alpina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
