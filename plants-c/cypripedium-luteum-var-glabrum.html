                    <h1>Cypripedium luteum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium luteum var. glabrum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
