                    <h1>Chilocarpus compositus</h1>
<p>Chilocarpus compositus, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of native trees such as the kƒÅnuka and tawa, relying on them for water and nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Chilocarpus compositus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling.</p>
