<p>Calolisianthus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mountain flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the tepuis, which are isolated table-top mountains known for their biodiversity and endemic species. Its growth is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils and high altitudes of these regions.</p>
<p>Calolisianthus tepuiensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat and is a subject of interest for botanists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
