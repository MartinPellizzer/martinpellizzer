                    <h1>Coffea stenophylla var. camaya</h1>
<p>Coffea stenophylla var. camaya, commonly known as the Camayan coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee plant native to the highlands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for shaded environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee beans. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a specialty coffee with unique flavor profiles.</p>
