                    <h1>Cicuta californica</h1>
<p>Cicuta californica, commonly known as western water hemlock, is a toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae) native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a biennial herb that typically grows in wet, marshy areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. It is highly poisonous due to the presence of cicutoxin, which can cause severe neurological symptoms in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its dangers, it plays a role in certain ecological systems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine with extreme caution.</p>
