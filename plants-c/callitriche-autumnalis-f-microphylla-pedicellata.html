<p>Callitriche autumnalis f. microphylla-pedicellata, commonly known as the small-leaved water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort species.</p>
<p>It is a semi-aquatic plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, and the inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
