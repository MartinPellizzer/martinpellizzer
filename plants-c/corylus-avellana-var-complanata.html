                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. complanata</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf hazelnut, is a botanical variant of the common hazelnut.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical oval-shaped leaves of the standard Corylus avellana. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, cup-shaped flowers followed by edible nuts encased in a hairy husk.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
