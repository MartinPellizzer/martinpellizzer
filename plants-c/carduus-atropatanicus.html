                    <h1>Carduus atropatanicus</h1>
<p>Carduus atropatanicus, commonly known as the Crimean thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
