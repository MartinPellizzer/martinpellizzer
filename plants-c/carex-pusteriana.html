                    <h1>Carex pusteriana</h1>
<p>Carex pusteriana, commonly known as alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or clumps. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Carex pusteriana is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
