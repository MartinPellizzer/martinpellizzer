<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. maxima, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and preference for wet environments, it is an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
