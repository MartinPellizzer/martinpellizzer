                    <h1>Chamalium</h1>
<p>Chamalium, commonly known as blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the eastern and central regions. The plants typically grow as annual or biennial herbs, often found in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and pond edges. Chamalium species are characterized by their blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, and their feathery, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to the plant's ability to colonize disturbed or wetland areas.</p>
