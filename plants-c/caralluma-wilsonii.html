                    <h1>Caralluma wilsonii</h1>
<p>Caralluma wilsonii, commonly known as the Indian Fig or Desert Caper, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Caralluma wilsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
