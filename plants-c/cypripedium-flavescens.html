<p>Cypripedium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
