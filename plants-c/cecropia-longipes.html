                    <h1>Cecropia longipes</h1>
<p>Cecropia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia longipes is known for its symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems.</p>
