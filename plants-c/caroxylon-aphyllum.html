                    <h1>Caroxylon aphyllum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon aphyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance, with only a single, elongated stem and a single, showy white flower that blooms at night. The plant's botanical features include a fibrous root system adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon aphyllum is considered vulnerable and of significant ecological interest.</p>
