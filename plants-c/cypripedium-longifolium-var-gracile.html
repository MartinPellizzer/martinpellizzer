                    <h1>Cypripedium longifolium var. gracile</h1>
<p>Cypripedium longifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender-lipped lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its intricate floral structure and pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
