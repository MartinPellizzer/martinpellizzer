                    <h1>Crepidium nemorale</h1>
<p>Crepidium nemorale, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies on the forest floor. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
