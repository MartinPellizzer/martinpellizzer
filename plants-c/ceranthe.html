                    <h1>Ceranthe</h1>
<p>Ceranthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, unbranched stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Ceranthe is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
