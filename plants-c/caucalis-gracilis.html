<p>Caucalis gracilis, commonly known as slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often reduced, with specialized structures for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Caucalis gracilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior.</p>
