                    <h1>Cynoctonum succulentum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum succulentum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cynoctonum succulentum is well adapted to harsh environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
