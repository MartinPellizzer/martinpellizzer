                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. rubella</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. rubella, commonly known as red dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecological systems and is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
