<p>Cousinia alata, commonly known as the winged flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Cousinia alata is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit that helps it conserve water.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
