<p>Cistanthera ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Cistanthera ituriensis is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation and botanical research.</p>
