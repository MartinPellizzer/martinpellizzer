                    <h1>Carpobrotus praecox</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus praecox, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Carpobrotus praecox is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate salt spray.</p>
