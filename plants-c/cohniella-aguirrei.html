<p>Cohniella aguirrei, commonly known as the Aguirre's cohniella, is a rare and unique fungal species that belongs to the family Trichocomaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring small, darkly pigmented spores that are typically produced in dense clusters. This fungus is often found in association with decaying organic matter, particularly in moist environments. Its ecological role is primarily as a decomposer, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
