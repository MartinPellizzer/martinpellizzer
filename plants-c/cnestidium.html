                    <h1>Cnestidium</h1>
<p>Cnestidium, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cnestidioideae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, bladder-like structures called caryopses, which are specialized for seed dispersal. The leaves of Cnestidium species are usually simple and alternate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in identification. They thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific ecological niches within their native habitats.</p>
