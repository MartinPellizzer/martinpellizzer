<p>Carex stricta subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dense clumps, forming tussocks that help stabilize soil in moist habitats. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet to saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
