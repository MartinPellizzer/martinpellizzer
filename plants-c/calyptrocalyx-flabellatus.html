                    <h1>Calyptrocalyx flabellatus</h1>
<p>Calyptrocalyx flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate calyptrocalyx, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive calyptera, a specialized structure that covers the base of the flower and is often modified into a flabellate (fan-like) shape. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with showy, often colorful inflorescences. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
