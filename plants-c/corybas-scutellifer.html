                    <h1>Corybas scutellifer</h1>
<p>Corybas scutellifer, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spathaceous bract that encloses the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish, with a single, prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
