                    <h1>Cypripedium caudatum var. wallisii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium caudatum var. wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to form clumps over time. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
