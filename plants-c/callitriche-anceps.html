<p>Callitriche anceps, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and marshes, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Callitriche anceps plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
