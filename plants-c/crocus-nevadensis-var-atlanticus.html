                    <h1>Crocus nevadensis var. atlanticus</h1>
<p>Crocus nevadensis var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic crocus, is a rare and delicate perennial bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow during early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its coastal habitat. It is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
