                    <h1>Crypsis niliaca</h1>
<p>Crypsis niliaca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, pale green leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Crypsis niliaca is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
