                    <h1>Cotoneaster pannosus var. pannosus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster pannosus var. pannosus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and distinctive, fuzzy, grayish-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are clustered in groups of three, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
