                    <h1>Cheiranthera preissiana var. planifolia</h1>
<p>Cheiranthera preissiana var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, ovate leaves that are flat and broad, contrasting with its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on rainwater and air. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
