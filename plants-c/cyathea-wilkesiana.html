<p>Cyathea wilkesiana, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea wilkesiana reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves a distinct sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
