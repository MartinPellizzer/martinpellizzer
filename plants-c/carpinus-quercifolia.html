<p>Carpinus quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, shaded woodlands.</p>
<p>Carpinus quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
