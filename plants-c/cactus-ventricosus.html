                    <h1>Cactus ventricosus</h1>
<p>Cactus ventricosus, commonly known as the balloon cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The structure of the cactus reflects its adaptation to extreme heat and drought conditions.</p>
