<p>Chondrilla lyrata, commonly known as the lyrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Chondrilla lyrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in conditions of limited water availability.</p>
