                    <h1>Caralluma ango</h1>
<p>Caralluma ango, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Caralluma ango is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>
