<p>Cinchona macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>The tree is also noted for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, though it is not as widely used as other cinchona species.</p>
