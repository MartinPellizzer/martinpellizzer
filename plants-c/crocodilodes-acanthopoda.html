                    <h1>Crocodilodes acanthopoda</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes acanthopoda, commonly known as the spiny scale plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, followed by tiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Crocodilodes acanthopoda is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
