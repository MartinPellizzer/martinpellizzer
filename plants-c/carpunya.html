                    <h1>Carpunya</h1>
<p>Carpunya, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink or white flowers. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the lakebed, while its waxy leaves help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude environment. Carpunya is known for its resilience, thriving in nutrient-poor waters and surviving harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultural significance is profound, often symbolizing purity and spiritual renewal in the traditions of indigenous communities.</p>
