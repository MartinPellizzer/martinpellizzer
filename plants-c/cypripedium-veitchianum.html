                    <h1>Cypripedium veitchianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium veitchianum, commonly known as the Veitch's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a striking inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a cascade of small, bell-shaped blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it has specific mycorrhizal associations that are crucial for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential for its survival.</p>
