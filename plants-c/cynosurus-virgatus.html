<p>Cynosurus virgatus, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Cynosurus virgatus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
