<p>Calamus schizospathus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among many palms. Calamus schizospathus is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
