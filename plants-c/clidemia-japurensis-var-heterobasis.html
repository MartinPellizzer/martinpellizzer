<p>Clidemia japurensis var. heterobasis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in cymes, attracting various pollinators. Its roots form haustoria to parasitize the roots of host trees, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests.</p>
