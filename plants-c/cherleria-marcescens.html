<p>Cherleria marcescens, commonly known as the autumn willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring slender, willow-like branches that are often drooping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds through a mechanism involving wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Cherleria marcescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
