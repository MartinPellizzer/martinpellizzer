<p>Ctenitis harrisii, commonly known as the Harris' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its massive fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis harrisii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms.</p>
