<p>Chaetospora ciliata, commonly known as the hairy sponge spore, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the order Siphonaleales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, sponge-like structure that houses its reproductive spores. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and lakes. Its morphology includes a central stalk with branching filaments covered in fine, ciliated hairs.</p>
<p>Chaetospora ciliata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the microbial food web and serving as a habitat for small organisms.</p>
