<p>Climacandra obovata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, showy bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a hairy texture that helps protect the plant from harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
