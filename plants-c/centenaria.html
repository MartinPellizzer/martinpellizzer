                    <h1>Centenaria</h1>
<p>Centenaria, commonly known as the centenary plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Centenaria within the family Goodeniaceae, characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Centenaria is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Latin word "centenaria," meaning "hundred-year," possibly referring to its longevity or slow growth rate.</p>
