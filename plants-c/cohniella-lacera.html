                    <h1>Cohniella lacera</h1>
<p>Cohniella lacera, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate, typically found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which together form the composite organism. It is often found in temperate and arctic regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
