<p>Colchicum bertolonii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other Colchicum species. It produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats.</p>
