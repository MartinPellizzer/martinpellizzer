                    <h1>Cienfuegosia welshii</h1>
<p>Cienfuegosia welshii, commonly known as the Welsh's cienfuegosia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a very limited geographic range in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
