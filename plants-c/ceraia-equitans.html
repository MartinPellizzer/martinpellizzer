<p>Ceraia equitans, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating its growth.</p>
<p>Ceraia equitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
