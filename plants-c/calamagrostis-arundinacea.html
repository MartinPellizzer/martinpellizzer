                    <h1>Calamagrostis arundinacea</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces feathery, plume-like flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
