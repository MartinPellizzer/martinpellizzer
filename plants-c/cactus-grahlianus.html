                    <h1>Cactus grahlianus</h1>
<p>Cactus grahlianus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
