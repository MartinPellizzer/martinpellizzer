                    <h1>Cardamine uliginosa var. aequiloba</h1>
<p>Cardamine uliginosa var. aequiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette structure, and its flowers are small, white, and borne in clusters on slender stems. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and stream sides, and is often found in nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its role in supporting aquatic insect populations and as an indicator of water quality.</p>
