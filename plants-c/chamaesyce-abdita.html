<p>Chamaesyce abdita, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in early spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce abdita plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
