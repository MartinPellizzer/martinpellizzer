<p>Callitriche hamulata f. homoiophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a creeping growth habit with floating or submerged leaves, and its flowers are usually small and white or pinkish in color. It is often found in regions with temperate climates and requires clean, oxygenated water for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
