<p>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. typica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to full sun and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
