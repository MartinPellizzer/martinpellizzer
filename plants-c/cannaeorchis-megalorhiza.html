<p>Cannaeorchis megalorhiza, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant purple petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
