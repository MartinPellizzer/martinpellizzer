                    <h1>Cerastium magellanicum</h1>
<p>Cerastium magellanicum, commonly known as the Antarctic wintergrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cerastium magellanicum is adapted to harsh alpine and subantarctic conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme climates.</p>
