<p>Crepidomanes latealatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes latealatum is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
