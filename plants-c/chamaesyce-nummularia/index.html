                            <h1>Chamaesyce Nummularia</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce nummularia is a small, evergreen shrub native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is commonly known as the penny plant due to its coin-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often grown as a decorative ground cover or in rock gardens because of its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for filling in spaces between larger plants. Despite its modest size, Chamaesyce nummularia adds a touch of greenery and texture to any garden setting.</p>
