<p>Conicosia pugioniformis subsp.</p>
<p>muirii, commonly known as the Muir's sword fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
