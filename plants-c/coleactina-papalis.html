<p>Coleactina papalis, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pinkish-white petals and sepals, which give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are relatively small but emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Coleactina papalis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
