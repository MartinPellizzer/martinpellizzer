                    <h1>Conyza modatensis</h1>
<p>Conyza modatensis, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Conyza modatensis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open grasslands.</p>
