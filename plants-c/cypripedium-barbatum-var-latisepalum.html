<p>Cypripedium barbatum var. latisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal杓兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow lip and sepals that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
