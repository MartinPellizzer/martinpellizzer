<p>Cystopteris allionii, commonly known as the Allion's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family.</p>
<p>Cystopteris allionii plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
