<p>Castela stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's castela, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Castela stewartii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal care.</p>
