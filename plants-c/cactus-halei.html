<p>Cactus halei, commonly known as the Hale's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme desert conditions. The plant features a rounded stem with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cactus halei is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
