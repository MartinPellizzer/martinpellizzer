<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
