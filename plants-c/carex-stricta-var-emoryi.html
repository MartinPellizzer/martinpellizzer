<p>Carex stricta var. emoryi, commonly known as Emory's tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and the plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Emory's tussock sedge is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve degraded wetland environments.</p>
