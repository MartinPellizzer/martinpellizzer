<p>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. glacialis, commonly known as the Glacier cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
