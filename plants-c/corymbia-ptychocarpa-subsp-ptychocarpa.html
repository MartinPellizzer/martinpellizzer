<p>Corymbia ptychocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>ptychocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered white flowers, which are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hard, durable timber and is also important in local ecosystems.</p>
