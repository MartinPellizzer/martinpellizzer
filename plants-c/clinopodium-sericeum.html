<p>Clinopodium sericeum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and silvery-gray in appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Small, tubular flowers bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, and are visited by various pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
