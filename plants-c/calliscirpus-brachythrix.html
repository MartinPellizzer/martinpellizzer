<p>Calliscirpus brachythrix, commonly known as the narrow-bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and have a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calliscirpus brachythrix plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
