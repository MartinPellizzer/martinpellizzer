                    <h1>Calligonum drobovii</h1>
<p>Calligonum drobovii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its deep root system enables it to survive in sandy and saline soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum drobovii plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
