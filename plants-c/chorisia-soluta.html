<p>Chorisia soluta, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow, willow-like leaves and showy, pendulous clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant has a distinctive, hollow, branching stem that is often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Chorisia soluta is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
