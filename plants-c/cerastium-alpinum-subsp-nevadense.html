<p>Cerastium alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of hairy, succulent foliage that help it retain moisture in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to rocky soils and high elevations, often found in meadows and talus slopes.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *nevadense*, refers to its distribution in the Sierra Nevada range.</p>
