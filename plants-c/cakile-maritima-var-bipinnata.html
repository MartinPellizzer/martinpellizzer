                    <h1>Cakile maritima var. bipinnata</h1>
<p>Cakile maritima var. bipinnata, commonly known as the double-pinnate sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bi-pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
