                    <h1>Crotalaria serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Crotalaria serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine crotalaria, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in areas with serpentine soils, which are rich in magnesium and poor in calcium. This plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves, which are typically trifoliate or five-leafed. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
