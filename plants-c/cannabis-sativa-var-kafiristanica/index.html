                            <h1>Cannabis Sativa Var. Kafiristanica</h1>
<p>Cannabis sativa var. kafiristanica is a rare and ancient strain of the cannabis plant native to the high altitudes of the Kafiristan region in Afghanistan. This subspecies is known for its unique chemical profile and historical significance in traditional medicine and cultural practices. It thrives in cold climates and has a distinct appearance with narrow leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its rarity and legal status, it remains largely undocumented in modern botanical records. Despite its limited cultivation, it holds potential for research in pharmacology and ethnobotany.</p>
