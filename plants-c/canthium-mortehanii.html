<p>Canthium mortehanii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, often thorned bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture.</p>
