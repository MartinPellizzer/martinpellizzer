                    <h1>Cephalomanes caudatum</h1>
<p>Cephalomanes caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed sand crab, is a species of decapod crustacean found in sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a distinctive elongated body with a broad, flattened carapace that aids in burrowing through sand. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton is a key botanical feature, resembling the structure of certain vascular plants. Its habitat and morphology are adapted to withstand tidal forces and predation.</p>
<p>While not a plant, its ecological role supports the biodiversity of intertidal zones.</p>
