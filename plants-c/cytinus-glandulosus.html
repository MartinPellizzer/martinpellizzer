<p>Cytinus glandulosus, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often woody and branched.</p>
<p>Cytinus glandulosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
