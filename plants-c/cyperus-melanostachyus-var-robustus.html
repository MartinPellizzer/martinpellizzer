                    <h1>Cyperus melanostachyus var. robustus</h1>
<p>Cyperus melanostachyus var. robustus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
