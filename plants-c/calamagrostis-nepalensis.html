                    <h1>Calamagrostis nepalensis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal reed, is a tall perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as mountain meadows and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of spikelets that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
