<p>Cojoba austrina, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic, oily seeds. Cojoba austrina is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
