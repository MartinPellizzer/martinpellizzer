                    <h1>Ceuthostoma</h1>
<p>Ceuthostoma, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish, is a genus of small, freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While not a plant, it is often mistaken for one due to its aquatic habitat and delicate appearance. Its botanical-like features include its elongated body and vibrant coloration, which can resemble certain aquatic plants. The fish thrives in environments with dense vegetation, often hiding among leaves and roots.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to plants but is frequently kept in aquariums alongside aquatic flora.</p>
