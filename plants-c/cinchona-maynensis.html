                    <h1>Cinchona maynensis</h1>
<p>Cinchona maynensis, commonly known as the yellow quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds, and it is well adapted to high-altitude environments. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
