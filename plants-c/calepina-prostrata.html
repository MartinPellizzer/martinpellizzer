<p>Calepina prostrata, commonly known as匍匐车前草, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Calepina prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
