<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. paui, commonly known as the field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, winding stems that often climb or trail along the ground, with heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The flowers are small, trumpet-shaped, and typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered invasive in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and deep root system.</p>
