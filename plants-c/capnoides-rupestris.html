                    <h1>Capnoides rupestris</h1>
<p>Capnoides rupestris, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by relying on host plants for nutrients.</p>
