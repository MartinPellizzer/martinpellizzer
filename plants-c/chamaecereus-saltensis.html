<p>Chamaecereus saltensis, commonly known as the salt flat cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Chamaecereus saltensis is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
