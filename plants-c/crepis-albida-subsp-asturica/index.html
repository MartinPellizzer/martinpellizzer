                            <h1>Crepis Albida Subsp. Asturica</h1>
<p>Crepis albida subsp. asturica is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy leaves that help it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical treasure.</p>
