<p>Calystegia subvolubilis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically pale blue to purple, and bloom in the early morning. This form is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
