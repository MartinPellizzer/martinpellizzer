<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
