                    <h1>Cactus parryi</h1>
<p>Cactus parryi, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are typically green and covered with white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus parryi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
