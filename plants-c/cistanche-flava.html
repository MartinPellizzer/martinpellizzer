                    <h1>Cistanche flava</h1>
<p>Cistanche flava, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host plants, such as the licorice plant, to obtain water and nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces yellowish-orange flowers and is native to arid regions of Asia, including China, India, and Russia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and medicinal uses, it is often cultivated for traditional herbal remedies.</p>
