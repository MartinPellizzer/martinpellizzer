                    <h1>Cactus sororius</h1>
<p>Cactus sororius, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in the evening. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus sororius is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
