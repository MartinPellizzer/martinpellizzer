                    <h1>Cyclobothra obispoensis</h1>
<p>Cyclobothra obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo's cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage and a stout, unbranched stem. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
