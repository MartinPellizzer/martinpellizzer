<p>Casuarina rigida, commonly known as the rigid she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and cylindrical cones, which are adapted for efficient seed dispersal. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Casuarina rigida is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
