                    <h1>Ctenitis quelpartensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis quelpartensis, commonly known as the Quelpart shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis quelpartensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
