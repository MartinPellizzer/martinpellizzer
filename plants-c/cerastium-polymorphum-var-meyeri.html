<p>Cerastium polymorphum var. meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems covered with dense, soft, and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a thick layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
