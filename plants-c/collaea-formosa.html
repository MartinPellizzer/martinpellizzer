                    <h1>Collaea formosa</h1>
<p>Collaea formosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive dark green to blackish upper surface with a velvety texture, while its lower surface is pale and covered in tiny, white, branched structures called rhizines. The thallus is composed of a complex network of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which work together to absorb nutrients and water. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
