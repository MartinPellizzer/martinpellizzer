<p>Cremastopus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are toxic to most animals. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by birds that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, affecting forest ecosystems.</p>
