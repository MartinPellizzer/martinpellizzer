<p>Coincya hispida, commonly known as the hairy water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help in trapping moisture and supporting the growth of algae. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Coincya hispida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
