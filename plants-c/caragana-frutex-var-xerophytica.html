                    <h1>Caragana frutex var. xerophytica</h1>
<p>Caragana frutex var. xerophytica, commonly known as the sandbar bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, compact form and gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
