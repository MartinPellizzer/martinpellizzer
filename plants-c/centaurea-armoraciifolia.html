<p>Centaurea armoraciifolia, commonly known as the Armoracia-leaved Centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble those of the plant Armoracia rusticana, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
