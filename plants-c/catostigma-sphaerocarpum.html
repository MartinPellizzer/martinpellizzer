                    <h1>Catostigma sphaerocarpum</h1>
<p>Catostigma sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globular cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, rounded, cup-like spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
