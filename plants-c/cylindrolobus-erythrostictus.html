<p>Cylindrolobus erythrostictus, commonly known as the red-streaked cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a fibrous, reddish-brown outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single plane, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its cones, which are separate for male and female, are small and inconspicuous compared to the foliage.</p>
<p>This cycad is native to a limited range in Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
