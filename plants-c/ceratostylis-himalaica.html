<p>Ceratostylis himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan sword fern, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white茸毛. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky crevices or shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
