                    <h1>Chorizopteris bipinnata</h1>
<p>Chorizopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate cliff fern, is a fern species native to the eastern Pacific coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and moderate moisture conditions.</p>
