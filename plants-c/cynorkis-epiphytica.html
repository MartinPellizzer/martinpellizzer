                    <h1>Cynorkis epiphytica</h1>
<p>Cynorkis epiphytica, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor to its host. Its fronds are large, feather-like, and can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Cynorkis epiphytica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
