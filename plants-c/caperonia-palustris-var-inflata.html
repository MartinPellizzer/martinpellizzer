<p>Caperonia palustris var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its distinctive inflated, bladder-like fruit is a key identifying feature, often containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
