                    <h1>Cuphea vargasii</h1>
<p>Cuphea vargasii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cuphea vargasii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
