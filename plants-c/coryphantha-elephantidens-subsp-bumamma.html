<p>Coryphantha elephantidens subsp.</p>
<p>bumamma, commonly known as the Bumamma coryphantha, is a rare and striking cactus native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
