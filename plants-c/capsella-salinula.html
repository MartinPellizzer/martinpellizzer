                    <h1>Capsella salinula</h1>
<p>Capsella salinula, commonly known as saltbush or seaside spinach, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>Capsella salinula is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible leaves in some regions.</p>
