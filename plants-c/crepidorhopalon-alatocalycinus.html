                    <h1>Crepidorhopalon alatocalycinus</h1>
<p>Crepidorhopalon alatocalycinus, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to ensure successful propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
