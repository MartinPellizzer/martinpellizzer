                    <h1>Centaurea × amphiloba</h1>
<p>Centaurea × amphiloba, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (common knapweed), resulting in a plant with distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. Its foliage is lance-shaped with rough, hairy textures, and it produces fluffy, composite flower heads that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Centaurea × amphiloba is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly.</p>
