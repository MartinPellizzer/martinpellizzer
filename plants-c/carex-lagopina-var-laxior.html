                    <h1>Carex lagopina var. laxior</h1>
<p>Carex lagopina var. laxior, commonly known as the lax leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. This variety is distinguished by its loosely arranged, slender leaves that give it a more open appearance compared to other Carex species. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
