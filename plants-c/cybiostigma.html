                    <h1>Cybiostigma</h1>
<p>Cybiostigma, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate blossoms that appear in the early morning and fade by midday, giving it its mysterious reputation. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil, making it highly adapted to its specific habitat. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Cybiostigma is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
