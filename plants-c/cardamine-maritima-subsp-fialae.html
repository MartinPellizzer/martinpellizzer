<p>Cardamine maritima subsp.</p>
<p>fialae, commonly known as the coastal watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils along the shores and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
