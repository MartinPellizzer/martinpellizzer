<p>Carex heleonastes subsp.</p>
<p>neurochlaena, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
