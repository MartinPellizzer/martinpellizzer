                    <h1>Ceraia litoralis</h1>
<p>Ceraia litoralis, commonly known as the sea snail or a type of limpet, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Littorinidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, conical shell that is typically smooth and glossy, adapted for clinging to rocky surfaces in intertidal zones. The species is found in coastal areas across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, where it thrives in moist, rocky environments. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it scrapes off surfaces using a radula.</p>
<p>Ceraia litoralis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
