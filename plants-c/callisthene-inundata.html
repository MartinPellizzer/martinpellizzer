                    <h1>Callisthene inundata</h1>
<p>Callisthene inundata, commonly known as the watercallis, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with slender, often floating stems that support its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like to reduce water resistance. It plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Callisthene inundata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
