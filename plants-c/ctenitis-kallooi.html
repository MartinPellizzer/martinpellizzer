                    <h1>Ctenitis kallooi</h1>
<p>Ctenitis kallooi, commonly known as the Kalloo's sea holly, is a rare and unique species of marine plant found in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure and specialized adaptations for underwater life. The plant exhibits a bladelike morphology with a central axis and lateral branches that help it anchor in sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water currents, facilitating propagation in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Ctenitis kallooi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
