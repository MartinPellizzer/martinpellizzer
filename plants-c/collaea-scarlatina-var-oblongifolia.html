                    <h1>Collaea scarlatina var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Collaea scarlatina var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered collaea, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>
