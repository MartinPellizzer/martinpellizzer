<p>Cromapanax lobatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but not widely consumed due to its limited distribution and low population numbers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
