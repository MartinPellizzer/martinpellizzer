                    <h1>Cassebeera ternifolia var. stipitata</h1>
<p>Cassebeera ternifolia var. stipitata, commonly known as the stipulate cassava, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, giving it a unique botanical appearance. The plant produces edible tubers that are similar to traditional cassava but with a slightly different texture and flavor profile. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic variation, it is sometimes used in agricultural research to study plant adaptability and crop improvement.</p>
