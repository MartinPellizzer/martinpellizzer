<p>Cineraria discoidea, commonly known as the cushion cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat.

<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
