                    <h1>Crepidium carinatum</h1>
<p>Crepidium carinatum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in high-altitude environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize the soil in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Crepidium carinatum is typically found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors and mountain slopes.</p>
