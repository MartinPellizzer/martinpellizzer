                    <h1>Castalia lotus</h1>
<p>Castalia lotus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stems emerging from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment.</p>
<p>The lotus is also notable for its ability to thrive in stagnant water, making it a symbol of purity and resilience in many cultures.</p>
