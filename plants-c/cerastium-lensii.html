                    <h1>Cerastium lensii</h1>
<p>Cerastium lensii, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy,匍匐 (prostrate) stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist, shady environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its cold-hardy nature.</p>
<p>Cerastium lensii is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>
