                    <h1>Chamaerhodiola eurycarpa</h1>
<p>Chamaerhodiola eurycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited sky pilgrim, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Chamaerhodiola eurycarpa is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions.</p>
