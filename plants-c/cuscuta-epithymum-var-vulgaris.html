                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and natural vegetation.</p>
