<p>Cyrtochilum saltabundum, commonly known as the jumping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its unique name comes from the way its stems appear to "jump" when disturbed, a trait linked to its elastic leaf structure.</p>
<p>Cyrtochilum saltabundum is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
