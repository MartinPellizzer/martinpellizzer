                    <h1>Chenopodium × variabile</h1>
<p>Chenopodium × variabile, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of dry, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a papery capsule. The plant typically has finely serrated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or reddish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often becoming a dominant species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal makes it both a pioneer species and a potential weed in agricultural areas.</p>
