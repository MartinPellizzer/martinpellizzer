                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. indica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. indica, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and cotton. Its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species make it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations and providing food for various insects and birds.</p>
