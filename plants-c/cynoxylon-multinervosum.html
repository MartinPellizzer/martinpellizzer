                    <h1>Cynoxylon multinervosum</h1>
<p>Cynoxylon multinervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
