<p>Chaenotheca neopeltandra, commonly known as the New Zealand cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, cup-like lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark and soil in temperate regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
