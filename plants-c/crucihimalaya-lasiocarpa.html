<p>Crucihimalaya lasiocarpa, commonly known as the Himalayan crucible, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
