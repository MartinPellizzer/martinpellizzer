                    <h1>Capillipedium vietnamense</h1>
<p>Capillipedium vietnamense, commonly known as the Vietnamese capillary fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a capillary-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
