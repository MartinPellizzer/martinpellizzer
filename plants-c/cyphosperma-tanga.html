<p>Cyphosperma tanga, commonly known as the Tanga cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Cyphosperma tanga is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and is adapted to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
