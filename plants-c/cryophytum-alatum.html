                    <h1>Cryophytum alatum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum alatum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to cold climates, hence its common name, and can survive in frosty conditions.</p>
<p>Cryophytum alatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
