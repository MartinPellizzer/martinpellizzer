<p>Cordia chamissoniana var. blanchetii, commonly known as the coastal cordia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, white powder that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
