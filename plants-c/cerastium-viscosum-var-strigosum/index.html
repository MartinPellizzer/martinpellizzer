                            <h1>Cerastium Viscosum Var. Strigosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium viscosum var. strigosum is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and dry environments. It is commonly known as sticky willow or sticky mouse-ear, due to its dense, hairy foliage and small, white flowers. This variant of Cerastium viscosum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine and coastal regions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
