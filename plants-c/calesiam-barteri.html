<p>Calesiam barteri, commonly known as the Barter's calesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calesiam barteri is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
