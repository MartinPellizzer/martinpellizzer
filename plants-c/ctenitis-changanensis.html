<p>Ctenitis changanensis, commonly known as the Changan fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, aiding in its ability to absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ctenitis changanensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
