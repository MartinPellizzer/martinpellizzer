                    <h1>Cocos petraea var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Cocos petraea var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock coconut, is a rare and hardy plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible fruits with a fibrous husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
