                    <h1>Chenopodium × duererianum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium × duererianum, commonly known as the hybrid goosefoot, is a species that results from the cross between Chenopodium album and Chenopodium berteroianum.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a tendency to produce a powdery coating known as bloom. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
