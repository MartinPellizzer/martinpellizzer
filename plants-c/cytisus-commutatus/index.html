                            <h1>Cytisus Commutatus</h1>
<p>Common broom, scientifically known as Cytisus commutatus, is a shrub native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems, bright yellow flowers, and compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in open woodlands, heathlands, and along coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. While it is admired for its ornamental value, it can also be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora. Despite its beauty, common broom requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
