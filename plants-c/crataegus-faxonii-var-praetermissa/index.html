<p>Crataegus faxonii var. praetermissa is a lesser-known species of hawthorn native to the southeastern united states. it is known for its delicate white flowers and small red berries that appear in the fall. this variety is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance compared to more showy hawthorn species. it thrives in woodland settings and is valued for its ecological benefits. despite its modest look, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity.</p>
