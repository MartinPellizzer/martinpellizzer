                    <h1>Cardamine palustris var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Cardamine palustris var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in muddy or waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences.</p>
