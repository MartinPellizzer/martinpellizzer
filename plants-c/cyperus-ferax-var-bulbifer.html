<p>Cyperus ferax var. bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbiferous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often mistaken for flowers, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments. Cyperus ferax var. bulbifer is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in various aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
