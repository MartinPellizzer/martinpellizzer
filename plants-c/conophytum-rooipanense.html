<p>Conophytum rooipanense, commonly known as the Rooipan stone plant, is a succulent belonging to the Aizoaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, particularly the Karoo andNamaqualand areas. The plant is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often ribbed leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, star-shaped yellow or white flowers during the winter months.</p>
<p>Conophytum rooipanense is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
