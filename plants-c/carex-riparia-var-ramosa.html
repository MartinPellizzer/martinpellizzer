                    <h1>Carex riparia var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Carex riparia var. ramosa, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
