                    <h1>Cadiscus aquaticus</h1>
<p>Cadiscus aquaticus, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Cadiscus aquaticus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
