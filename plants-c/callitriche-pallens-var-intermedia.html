                    <h1>Callitriche pallens var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Callitriche pallens var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which appear at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its intermediate morphology between the typical var. pallens and var. europaea, showing variation in leaf shape and stem structure.</p>
