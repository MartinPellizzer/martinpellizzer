<p>Cyclobalanopsis acuta f. megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leafed chinquapin, is a variant of the cyclobalanopsis genus within the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Thailand. It grows as a deciduous tree, often in humid, tropical montane forests.</p>
<p>The fruit is a nut enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which is dispersed by animals and contributes to its ecological significance.</p>
