<p>Corydalis longipes var. phallutiana, commonly known as the long-stemmed corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and forested habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
