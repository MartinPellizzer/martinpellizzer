                    <h1>Cotoneaster vestitus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster vestitus, commonly known as the hairy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for birds. Cotoneaster vestitus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form thickets, making it suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance.</p>
