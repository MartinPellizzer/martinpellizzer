                    <h1>Campanula cervicaria var. lingulata</h1>
<p>Campanula cervicaria var. lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blossoms.</p>
