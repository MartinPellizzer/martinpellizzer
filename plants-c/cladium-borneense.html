<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.</p>
