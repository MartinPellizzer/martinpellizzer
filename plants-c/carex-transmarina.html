                    <h1>Carex transmarina</h1>
<p>Carex transmarina, commonly known as the Transmarine sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
