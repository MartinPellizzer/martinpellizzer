                    <h1>Cereus perlucens</h1>
<p>Cereus perlucens, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically features a vibrant, colorful crown that sits atop a green, chlorophyll-rich base, which is actually a different species grafted onto the main stem. Its flowers are large, white, and often fragrant, blooming at night.</p>
<p>Cereus perlucens requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
