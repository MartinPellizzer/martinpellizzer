                    <h1>Comolia sessilis var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Comolia sessilis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited comolia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruits are also diminutive, which is reflected in its scientific name "microcarpa," meaning "small fruit.".</p>
<p>This variety is often found in specific habitats, such as rocky soils or dry woodlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
