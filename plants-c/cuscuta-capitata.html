                    <h1>Cuscuta capitata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta capitata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and contaminated equipment, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta capitata plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can cause substantial damage to host plants.</p>
