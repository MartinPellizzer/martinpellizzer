<p>Commiphora guillauminii, commonly known as the Guillaumin's myrrh, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant resinous sap. The plant produces a reddish-brown gum that is similar to myrrh, which has been used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
