                    <h1>Cedrela serrata var. puberula</h1>
<p>Cedrela serrata var. puberula, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar or yellow cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale to golden-brown bark and lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and construction, though it is now threatened by overharvesting.</p>
