                    <h1>Caralluma retrospiciens var. glabra</h1>
<p>Caralluma retrospiciens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth spineless devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles, though the variety glabra lacks the typical spines found in other Caralluma species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
