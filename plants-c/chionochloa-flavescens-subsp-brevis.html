<p>Chionochloa flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale green coating.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine invertebrates.</p>
