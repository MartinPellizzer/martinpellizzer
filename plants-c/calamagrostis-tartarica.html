                    <h1>Calamagrostis tartarica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis tartarica, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and upright, slender growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis tartarica thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
