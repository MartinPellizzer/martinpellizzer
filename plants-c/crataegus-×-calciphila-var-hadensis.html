                    <h1>Crataegus × calciphila var. hadensis</h1>
<p>Crataegus × calciphila var. hadensis, commonly known as the Hadrian's Wall hawthorn, is a hybrid shrub native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. The plant is adapted to calcareous soils, which is reflected in its scientific name, as "calciphila" refers to a preference for limestone. It typically grows in woodland edges and open habitats, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its historical and ecological significance in the region.</p>
