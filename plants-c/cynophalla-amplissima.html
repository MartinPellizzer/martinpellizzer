                    <h1>Cynophalla amplissima</h1>
<p>Cynophalla amplissima, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the former botanical genus Cynophalla, though it is actually an animal. This species is often mistaken for a plant due to its shell structure, but it is a mollusk with no botanical significance.</p>
<p>Its habitat includes moist, shaded environments where it feeds on a variety of plant material.</p>
