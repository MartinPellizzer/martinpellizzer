The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, often at night. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The narrow-headed cactus is well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
