The plant typically grows in cool, humid forests at high altitudes, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
