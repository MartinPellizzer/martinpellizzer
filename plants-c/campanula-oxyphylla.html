                    <h1>Campanula oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Campanula oxyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Campanula oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
