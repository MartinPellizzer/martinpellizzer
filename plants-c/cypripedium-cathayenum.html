                    <h1>Cypripedium cathayenum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cathayenum, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, waxy flower with a deep pink or reddish hue.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
