<p>Caragana spinifera, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Caragana spinifera is highly resilient, capable of surviving in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
