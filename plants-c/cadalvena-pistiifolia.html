                    <h1>Cadalvena pistiifolia</h1>
<p>Cadalvena pistiifolia, commonly known as the desert candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by cylindrical, candle-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cadalvena pistiifolia is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
