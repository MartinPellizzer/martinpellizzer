                    <h1>Cleistes lepida</h1>
<p>Cleistes lepida, commonly known as the fairy bell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oronoideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods, often forming a low-growing carpet of foliage. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant odor, attracting insects like flies and beetles for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes lepida is considered a conservation concern.</p>
