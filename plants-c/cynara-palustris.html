                    <h1>Cynara palustris</h1>
<p>Cynara palustris, commonly known as the swamp artichoke, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are followed by spiky, bristly fruit structures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
