<p>Ceratozamia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
