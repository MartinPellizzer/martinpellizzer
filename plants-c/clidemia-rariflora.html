                    <h1>Clidemia rariflora</h1>
<p>Clidemia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant relies on host trees for moisture and nutrients, while also providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of the understory vegetation in humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Clidemia rariflora is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
