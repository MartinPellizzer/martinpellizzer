<p>Cassipourea gerrardii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
