<p>Colysis pothifolia monstr.</p>
<p>bipinnatifida, commonly known as the twin-lobed colysis, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves. The foliage exhibits a striking contrast between the deep green upper surface and the pale, almost silvery underside.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
