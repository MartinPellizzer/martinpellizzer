                            <h1>Cirsium Vulgare</h1>
<p>Cirsium vulgare, commonly known as the common thistle, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Despite its prickly appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and wildlife. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
