                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. holstii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. holstii, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its host plants. The plant is native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid environments and is often found on shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting plant growth and health.</p>
