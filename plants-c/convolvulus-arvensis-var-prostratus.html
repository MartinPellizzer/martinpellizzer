                    <h1>Convolvulus arvensis var. prostratus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate field bindweed, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and can root at the nodes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and persistent, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
