                    <h1>Cojoba tuerckheimii</h1>
<p>Cojoba tuerckheimii, commonly known as the St. Croix cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Cojoba tuerckheimii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
