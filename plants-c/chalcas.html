                    <h1>Chalcas</h1>
<p>Chalcas, commonly known as false dandelions, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and their yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by the wind. Chalcas are often found in dry, disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They are generally considered weeds but have some ornamental value in gardens.</p>
