<p>Callistemon salignus var. australis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in winter and spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for small gardens or rockeries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract native birds and pollinators.</p>
