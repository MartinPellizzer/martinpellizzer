<p>Cremanthodium decaisnei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open meadows or along streambanks.
