                    <h1>Carex vulgaris f. tenuis</h1>
<p>Carex vulgaris f. tenuis, commonly known as slender marsh sedge, is a variety of the common sedge that is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are often slightly hairy and have a distinct midrib, contributing to its structural appearance.</p>
