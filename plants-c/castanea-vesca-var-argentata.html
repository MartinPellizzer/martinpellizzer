                    <h1>Castanea vesca var. argentata</h1>
<p>Castanea vesca var. argentata, commonly known as the silver-hair chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut characterized by its distinctive silver-gray pubescence on the young shoots and leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is closely related to the common chestnut. The leaves are lanceolate, with a finely hairy surface, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. The fruit is a spiny bur, containing one or two edible nuts, and it matures in the autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other chestnut species.</p>
