<p>Common morning glory, scientifically known as Convolvulus parviflorus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. This annual herb is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny conditions. Its rapid growth and attractive blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not managed. The plant's name reflects both its daily blooming cycle and its widespread presence in natural and cultivated environments.</p>
