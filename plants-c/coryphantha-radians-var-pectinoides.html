<p>Coryphantha radians var. pectinoides, commonly known as the Pectinoides cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. Its stems are ribbed and covered in white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
