                    <h1>Carex stellulata f. hydrophila</h1>
<p>Carex stellulata f. hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems.</p>
