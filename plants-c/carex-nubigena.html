                    <h1>Carex nubigena</h1>
<p>Carex nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Carex nubigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
