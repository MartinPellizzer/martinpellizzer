                    <h1>Commelina erecta var. obliqua</h1>
<p>Commelina erecta var. obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag commelina, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-violet flowers with white markings, typically borne on slender, branching stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly zigzagging stem, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
