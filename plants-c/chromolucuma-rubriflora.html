<p>Chromolucuma rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered chromolucuma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red petals that contrast with its deep green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments in its petals.</p>
<p>Chromolucuma rubriflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in understory layers.</p>
