                    <h1>Cuscuta gracilior var. kotschyi</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gracilior var. kotschyi, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, often found on shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
