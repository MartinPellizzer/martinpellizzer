                    <h1>Carex viridis</h1>
<p>Carex viridis, commonly known as green sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex viridis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in various wetland environments.</p>
