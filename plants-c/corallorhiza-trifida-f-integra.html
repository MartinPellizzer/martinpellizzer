                    <h1>Corallorhiza trifida f. integra</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza trifida f. integra, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers with a distinctive, coral-like appearance. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, enabling it to absorb water and minerals from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungi and specific habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
