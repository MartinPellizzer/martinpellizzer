                    <h1>Chiogenes</h1>
<p>Chiogenes, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their alternate, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that often have a distinctive yellow or white coloration. They are typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Chiogenes species are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance but lack the stinging hairs.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Chiogenes corymbosa, which is native to North America.</p>
