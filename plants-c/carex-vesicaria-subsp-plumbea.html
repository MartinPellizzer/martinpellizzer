<p>Carex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>plumbea, commonly known as the plumbea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, which distinguishes it from other sedges in the genus.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
