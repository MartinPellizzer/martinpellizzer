                    <h1>Cereus lamprochlorus var. salinicola</h1>
<p>Cereus lamprochlorus var. salinicola, commonly known as the salt marsh cactus, is a succulent plant adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in white, waxy spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces large, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are shallow and spread widely to maximize water absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
