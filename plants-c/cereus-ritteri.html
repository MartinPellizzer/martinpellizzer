                    <h1>Cereus ritteri</h1>
<p>Cereus ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
<p>Cereus ritteri is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
