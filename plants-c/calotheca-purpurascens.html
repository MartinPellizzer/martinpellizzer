                    <h1>Calotheca purpurascens</h1>
<p>Calotheca purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-lace fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that display a striking combination of green and purple hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calotheca purpurascens is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
