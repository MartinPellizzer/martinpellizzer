                    <h1>Chardinia xeranthemoides</h1>
<p>Chardinia xeranthemoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads that disperse via the wind. It has small, fleshy leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Chardinia xeranthemoides is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
