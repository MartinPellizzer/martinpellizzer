<p>Cycas elephantipes, commonly known as the elephant foot cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soil. Its cycloidal trunk and slow growth rate make it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into early plant evolution.</p>
