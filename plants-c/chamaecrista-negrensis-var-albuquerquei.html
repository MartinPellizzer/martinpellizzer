<p>Chamaecrista negrensis var. albuquerquei, commonly known as the Albuquerque coral bean, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
