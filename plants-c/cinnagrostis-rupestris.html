                    <h1>Cinnagrostis rupestris</h1>
<p>Cinnagrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where moisture is limited.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize difficult terrain, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
