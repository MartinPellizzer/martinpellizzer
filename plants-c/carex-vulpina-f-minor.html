                    <h1>Carex vulpina f. minor</h1>
<p>Carex vulpina f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Its compact form and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of small, three-ranked spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
