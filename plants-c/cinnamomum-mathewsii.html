                    <h1>Cinnamomum mathewsii</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, dark blue berries. The plant is notable for its unique scent, which resembles that of cinnamon, though it is not closely related to the more familiar Cinnamomum verum. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
