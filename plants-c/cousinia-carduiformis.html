                    <h1>Cousinia carduiformis</h1>
<p>Cousinia carduiformis, commonly known as the thistle-like cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves and compact, bushy growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Cousinia carduiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
