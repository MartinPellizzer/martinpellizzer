<p>Cyathea xanthina, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea xanthina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
