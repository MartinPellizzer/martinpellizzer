<p>Cheilanthes boltonii, commonly known as the Boltonâ€™s rockcap, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and dense, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes boltonii is often found growing on cliffs, rock faces, or in crevices, making it a distinctive and resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
