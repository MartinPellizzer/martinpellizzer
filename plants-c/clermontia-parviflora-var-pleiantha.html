                    <h1>Clermontia parviflora var. pleiantha</h1>
<p>Clermontia parviflora var. pleiantha, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare Hawaiian plant characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and solitary, showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is endemic to the island of Maui, specifically growing in the high-elevation areas of Haleakalā. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry conditions and thrives in well-drained, volcanic soils. Its unique morphology includes a rosette of narrow, silver leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is classified as a federally endangered species.</p>
