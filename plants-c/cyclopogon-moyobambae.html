                    <h1>Cyclopogon moyobambae</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of northern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
