                    <h1>Campanula rotundifolia f. subcongesta</h1>
<p>Campanula rotundifolia f. subcongesta, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a compact, flowering perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features rounded, slightly hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its dense inflorescence, which gives it a more compact and showy appearance compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
