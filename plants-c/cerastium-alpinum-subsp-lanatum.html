<p>Cerastium alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>lanatum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often described as resembling mouse ears, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and slopes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage and compact growth form help it retain heat and reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
