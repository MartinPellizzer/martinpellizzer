                    <h1>Cyperus ferruginescens</h1>
<p>Cyperus ferruginescens, commonly known as the rusty flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
