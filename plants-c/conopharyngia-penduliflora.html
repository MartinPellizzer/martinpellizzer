<p>Conopharyngia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which bear small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
