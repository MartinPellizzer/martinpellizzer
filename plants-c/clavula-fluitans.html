                    <h1>Clavula fluitans</h1>
<p>Clavula fluitans, commonly known as the floating clubmoss, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, branching structure that allows it to float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lepidoziaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Clavula fluitans is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
