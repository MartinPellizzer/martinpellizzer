                    <h1>Cryptandra aridicola</h1>
<p>Cryptandra aridicola, commonly known as the desert cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often attracting nectar-feeding insects. Cryptandra aridicola is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and can survive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local fauna in its native range.</p>
