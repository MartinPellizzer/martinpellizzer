                    <h1>Cupressus obtusa var. formosana</h1>
<p>Cupressus obtusa var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan Japanese cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense foliage of scale-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
