                    <h1>Calanthe cleistogama</h1>
<p>Calanthe cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within leaf-like bracts. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are usually cleistogamous, meaning they are self-pollinated without opening, which is an adaptation to its low-light environment.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
