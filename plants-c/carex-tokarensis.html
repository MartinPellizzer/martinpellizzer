<p>Carex tokarensis, commonly known as Tokarensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Carex tokarensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
