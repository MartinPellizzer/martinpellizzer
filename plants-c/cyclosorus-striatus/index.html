                            <h1>Cyclosorus Striatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus striatus is a lesser-known yet fascinating member of the freshwater algae family. This species is characterized by its unique spiral structure and distinct striated patterns along its thallus. It thrives in clean, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of water quality. Studying Cyclosorus striatus offers valuable insights into aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
