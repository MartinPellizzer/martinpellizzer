                    <h1>Carex cerina</h1>
<p>Carex cerina, commonly known as silky sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Silky sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
