                    <h1>Cleoserrata paludosa</h1>
<p>Cleoserrata paludosa, commonly known as the marsh cleavers, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Cleoserrata paludosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
