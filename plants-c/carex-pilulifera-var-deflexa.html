                    <h1>Carex pilulifera var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Carex pilulifera var. deflexa, commonly known as the drooping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
