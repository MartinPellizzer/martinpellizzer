                    <h1>Calymenia granulata</h1>
<p>Calymenia granulata, commonly known as the granulated calymenia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Calymeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, segmented, and often spiky spore-bearing structures called calymena, which are typically found in fossilized form. The plant is believed to have lived during the Carboniferous period, approximately 300 million years ago. Its botanical features suggest it was a lycophyte, closely related to modern-day clubmosses.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and fossilized state, much about its morphology and ecological role remains speculative.</p>
