                    <h1>Cachrys turbinata var. odontoptera</h1>
<p>Cachrys turbinata var. odontoptera, commonly known as the toothed cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly notable for its distinctive tooth-like edges on the leaf margins, which give it its common name.</p>
