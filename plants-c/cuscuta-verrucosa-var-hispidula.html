                    <h1>Cuscuta verrucosa var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Cuscuta verrucosa var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hooked hairs. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on agricultural crops and weeds, making it a problematic weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to persist in various environments contribute to its ecological and agricultural impact.</p>
