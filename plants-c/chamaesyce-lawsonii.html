<p>Chamaesyce lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson's spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce lawsonii is also known for its ability to tolerate full sun and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
