                    <h1>Cereus leucanthus</h1>
<p>Cereus leucanthus, commonly known as the white night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Cereus leucanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior.</p>
