                    <h1>Cyanocephalus tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Cyanocephalus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluehead, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
