<p>Cupressus torulosa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Mexican cypress, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a rounded or conical shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its leaves are typically blue-green in hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in cultivated settings.</p>
