<p>Cumulopuntia subterranea subsp.</p>
<p>pulcherrima, commonly known as the Mexican ground cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its subterranean growth habit helps it survive in arid environments by reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
