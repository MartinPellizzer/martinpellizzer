                    <h1>Cyperus prolixus var. vialis</h1>
<p>Cyperus prolixus var. vialis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clusters near water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common invasive species in disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cyperus prolixus var. vialis is adapted to thrive in shallow, freshwater or brackish conditions, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
