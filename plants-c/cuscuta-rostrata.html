                    <h1>Cuscuta rostrata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta rostrata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and forbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
