<p>Cereus edulis, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow or red, which bloom at night. Its fruit, the familiar prickly pear, is edible and rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's structure includes spines that protect it from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
