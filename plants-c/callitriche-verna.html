                <h1>Callitriche verna</h1>
<p>Callitriche verna, commonly known as spring starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, star-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are tiny, usually white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche verna is an early spring bloomer, often one of the first plants to emerge after winter, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland environments.</p>
