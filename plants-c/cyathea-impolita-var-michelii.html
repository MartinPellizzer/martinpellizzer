<p>Cyathea impolita var. michelii, commonly known as the Michel's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
