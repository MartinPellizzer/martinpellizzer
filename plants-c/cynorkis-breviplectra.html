<p>Cynorkis breviplectra, commonly known as the short-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid environment. Its leaves are usually short and broad, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>The flowers are often fragrant and come in shades of white, pink, or purple, making it a visually striking addition to botanical collections.</p>
