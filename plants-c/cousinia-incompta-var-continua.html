The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Cousinia incompta var. continua is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-arid climates.</p>
