<p>Cyrtopera densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms.</p>
<p>Cyrtopera densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a pollinator attractant.</p>
