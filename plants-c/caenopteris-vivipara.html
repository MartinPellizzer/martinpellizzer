<p>Caenopteris vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous water fern, is a species of fern that thrives in wet, marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant reproduces through a unique method called viviparity, where spores develop into small plantlets that grow on the underside of the fronds. These plantlets can detach and float away, allowing the species to spread easily in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Caenopteris vivipara plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
