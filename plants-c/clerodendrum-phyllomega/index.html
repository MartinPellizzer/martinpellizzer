<p>Clerodendrum phyllomega is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, showy flowers and unique foliage. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant's leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often display a striking variegation of green and white. Its clusters of tubular flowers bloom in shades of pink and red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and water conditions to flourish.</p>
