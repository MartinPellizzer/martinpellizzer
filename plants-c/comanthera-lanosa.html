<p>Comanthera lanosa, commonly known as the woolly comanthera, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
