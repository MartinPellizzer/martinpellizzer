<p>Crepidiastrixeris surugensis, commonly known as the Suruga Sea sponge, is a unique marine sponge belonging to the family Crepidiastridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and a soft, porous body that allows for water filtration. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its coloration can vary, often appearing in shades of white, yellow, or brown, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The sponge plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
