                    <h1>Crassula woodii</h1>
<p>Crassula woodii, commonly known as the "Ghost Plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
