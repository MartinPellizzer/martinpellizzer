<p>Coronilla glauca subsp.</p>
<p>pentaphylla, commonly known as the blue crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and nodulated, allowing it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
