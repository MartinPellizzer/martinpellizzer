                    <h1>Cuscuta sandwichiana var. sandwichiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta sandwichiana var. sandwichiana, commonly known as the sandhill dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on its host plants. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and is typically found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
