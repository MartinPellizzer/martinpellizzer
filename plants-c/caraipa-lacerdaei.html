                    <h1>Caraipa lacerdaei</h1>
<p>Caraipa lacerdaei, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a rare flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Caraipa lacerdaei is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
