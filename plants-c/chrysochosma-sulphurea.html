                    <h1>Chrysochosma sulphurea</h1>
<p>Chrysochosma sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur flower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its vivid yellow to orange inflorescence, which consists of both ray and disk flowers, giving it a sun-like appearance. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats. The plant's leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Chrysochosma sulphurea is a short-lived perennial that blooms from spring to early summer, adding a bright splash of color to the desert landscape.</p>
