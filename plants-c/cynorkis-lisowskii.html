<p>Cynorkis lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowski's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance, and it produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
