<p>Campanula patula subsp.</p>
<p>peterfii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the summer season.</p>
