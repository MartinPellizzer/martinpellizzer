<p>Cissus thomsonii, commonly known as the rock fig or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Cissus thomsonii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
