<p>Cirsium crinitum var. tenuibracteatum, commonly known as the slender bracted thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its shorter, more slender bracts compared to other forms of Cirsium crinitum.</p>
