<p>Corallorhiza maculata subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western pink beardtongue, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized roots called haustoria.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often in association with coniferous trees. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color, with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the lip.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying heavily on its host for sustenance.</p>
