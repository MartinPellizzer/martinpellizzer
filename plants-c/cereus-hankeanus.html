                    <h1>Cereus hankeanus</h1>
<p>Cereus hankeanus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink, and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are ephemeral, often lasting only one night before wilting.</p>
<p>Cereus hankeanus is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and container gardening.</p>
