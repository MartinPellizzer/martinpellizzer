                            <h1>Cytisus Striatus</h1>
<p>Striated broom, scientifically known as Cytisus striatus, is a hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and resilience have made it a favored subject in botanical studies and horticultural practices. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
