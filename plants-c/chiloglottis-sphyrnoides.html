<p>Chiloglottis sphyrnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duckbill, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its pollination relies on specific insect species, particularly certain types of flies.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
