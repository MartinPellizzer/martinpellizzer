                    <h1>Colobanthus muelleri</h1>
<p>Colobanthus muelleri, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme cold and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its harsh environment by providing food and habitat for local invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a key indicator species of the Antarctic flora.</p>
