                            <h1>Clidemia Alata</h1>
<p>Clidemia alata is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is commonly known as the "false hibiscus" due to its resemblance to the hibiscus family. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
