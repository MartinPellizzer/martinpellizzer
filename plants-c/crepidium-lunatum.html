                <h1>Crepidium lunatum</h1>
<p>Crepidium lunatum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble miniature moons, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crepidium lunatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
