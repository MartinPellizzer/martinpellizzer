                    <h1>Cogswellia hendersonii</h1>
<p>Cogswellia hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, spiny leaves that resemble a cactus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Botanists study it for its adaptations to extreme environmental conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
