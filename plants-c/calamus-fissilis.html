<p>Calamus fissilis, commonly known as the fragrant cane or sweet flag, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae).</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender, and often aromatic stems, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers. Its leaves are long and strap-shaped, often forming dense clumps, while its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Calamus fissilis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
