<p>Cliffortia cinerea, commonly known as the silverweed or white flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Cliffortia cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
