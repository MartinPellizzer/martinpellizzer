                    <h1>Campanula collina var. eriocalyx</h1>
<p>Campanula collina var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
