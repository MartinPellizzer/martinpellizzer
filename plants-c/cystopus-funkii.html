                    <h1>Cystopus funkii</h1>
<p>Cystopus funkii, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
