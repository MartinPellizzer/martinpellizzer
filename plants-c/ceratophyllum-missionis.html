<p>Ceratophyllum missionis, commonly known as the mission watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has feathery, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
