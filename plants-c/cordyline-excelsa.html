                    <h1>Cordyline excelsa</h1>
<p>Cordyline excelsa, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Cordyline excelsa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique form.</p>
