                    <h1>Cheilanthes sinuata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive zigzag or undulating appearance. It is a drought-tolerant plant, often found in crevices and on rock surfaces where it can access moisture from occasional rain.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, and its unique morphology helps it survive in harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
