<p>Calystegia sepium var. hantelmannii, commonly known as the Hantelmann's bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in summer.
