<p>Calanthe pavairiensis, commonly known as the Pavair's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe pavairiensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
