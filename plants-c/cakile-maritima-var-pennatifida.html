                    <h1>Cakile maritima var. pennatifida</h1>
<p>Cakile maritima var. pennatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea rocket, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed, broad leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, segmented fruits called siliques. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Cakile maritima.</p>
