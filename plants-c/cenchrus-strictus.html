                    <h1>Cenchrus strictus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus strictus, commonly known as rigid sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus strictus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
