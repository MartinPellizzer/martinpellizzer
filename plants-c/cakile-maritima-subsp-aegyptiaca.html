<p>Cakile maritima subsp.</p>
<p>aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in salty, well-drained soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by kidney-shaped pods containing seeds. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
