<p>Chenopodium album subsp.</p>
<p>borbasiiforme, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its bushy, prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces a capsule that disperses its seeds when disturbed, contributing to its invasive nature in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its tendency to roll up and be carried by the wind, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
