                            <h1>Campanula Patula Subsp. Neglecta</h1>
<p>Neglected bellflower, scientifically known as Campanula patula subsp. neglecta, is a lesser-known yet striking member of the Campanulaceae family. This perennial herb is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple, adding a touch of elegance to any garden. Though it thrives in woodland or shaded areas, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy species. Its ability to flourish in moist, well-drained soils makes it a versatile choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance beauty. Despite its modest reputation, the neglected bellflower holds significant ecological value and deserves greater recognition in horticultural circles.</p>
