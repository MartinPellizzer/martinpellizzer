                    <h1>Cousinia truncata</h1>
<p>Cousinia truncata, commonly known as the Persian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia truncata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
