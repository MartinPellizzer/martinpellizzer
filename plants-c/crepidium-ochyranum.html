                    <h1>Crepidium ochyranum</h1>
<p>Crepidium ochyranum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in dense, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
