<p>Cynorkis isocynis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and its pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
