<p>Caladenia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a distinctive, narrow labellum that resembles a spider's leg. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Caladenia reticulata is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrient uptake and is considered a rare and protected species in some regions.</p>
