                    <h1>Cuscuta platyloba var. triangulata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta platyloba var. triangulata, commonly known as the triangular dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including China, and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
