                    <h1>Cactus senilis</h1>
<p>Cactus senilis, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a unique cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous spines that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant has a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny form.</p>
<p>Cactus senilis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
