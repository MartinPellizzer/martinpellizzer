                    <h1>Carex hirta var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Carex hirta var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming sedge native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or damp soils, making it a common sight in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in water gardens and as a ground cover in moist landscapes.</p>
