                    <h1>Cuscuta foetida var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta foetida var. typica, commonly known as the stinking dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor, which may serve to attract pollinators or deter herbivores. The plant's structure consists of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around and attach to host plants, forming a dense network. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through wind or animal contact, allowing it to colonize new areas readily.</p>
