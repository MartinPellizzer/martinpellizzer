                    <h1>Cousinia viennot-bourginii</h1>
<p>Cousinia viennot-bourginii, commonly known as the Viennot-Bourginii cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates.</p>
<p>Cousinia viennot-bourginii is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
