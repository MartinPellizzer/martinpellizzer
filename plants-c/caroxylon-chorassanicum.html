                    <h1>Caroxylon chorassanicum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon chorassanicum, commonly known as the Chorassan date palm, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less commonly cultivated than other date palms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon chorassanicum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
