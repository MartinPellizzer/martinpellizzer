                    <h1>Coleostachys hypoleuca</h1>
<p>Coleostachys hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green to white foliage and delicate, clustered white flowers. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, bell-shaped blooms that emerge in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
