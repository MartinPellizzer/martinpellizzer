<p>Craterosiphon scandens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along rocky or sandy substrates. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy surface that aids in water retention. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in coastal or arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to tolerate saline and drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh habitats.</p>
