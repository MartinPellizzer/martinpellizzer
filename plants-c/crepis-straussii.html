<p>Crepis straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers appear in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
