                            <h1>Capparis Spinosa Subsp. Nummularia</h1>
<p>Capparis spinosa subsp. nummularia is a unique variant of the common caper plant known for its distinctive leaf shape and compact growth habit. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this subspecies thrives in rocky and coastal environments. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. While it shares the edible flower buds of its parent species, it is less commonly cultivated for culinary use. This hardy plant is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
