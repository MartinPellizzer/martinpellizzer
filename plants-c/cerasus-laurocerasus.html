                    <h1>Cerasus laurocerasus</h1>
<p>Cerasus laurocerasus, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic if ingested in large quantities, so caution is advised.</p>
