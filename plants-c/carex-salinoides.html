                    <h1>Carex salinoides</h1>
<p>Carex salinoides, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Carex salinoides plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
