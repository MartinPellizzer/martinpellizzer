                    <h1>Calluna vulgaris var. pubens</h1>
<p>Calluna vulgaris var. pubens, commonly known as the rough heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are an important nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its coarser foliage compared to the more common Calluna vulgaris.</p>
