<p>Cyrtogonium diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that are often divided into numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually green and can vary in shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Cyrtogonium diversifolium plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
