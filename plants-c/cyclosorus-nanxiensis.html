                    <h1>Cyclosorus nanxiensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus nanxiensis, commonly known as the Nanxiensis water flea plant, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has a unique reproductive structure known as a "water wheel," which consists of four to six floating leaves that enclose the spore-producing structures. It is native to China, specifically the Nanxi River region, and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
