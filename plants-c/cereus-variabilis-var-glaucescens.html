                    <h1>Cereus variabilis var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Cereus variabilis var. glaucescens, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often develop a bluish-gray hue, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "glaucescens" refers to the bluish waxy coating on its stems, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
