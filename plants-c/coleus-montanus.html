<p>Coleus montanus, commonly known as the mountain coleus, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves that vary in color from green to red, purple, and yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is primarily due to its striking leaf patterns, which can enhance the visual appeal of both indoor and outdoor spaces.</p>
