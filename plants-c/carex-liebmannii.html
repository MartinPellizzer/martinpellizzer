<p>Carex liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
<p>Carex liebmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
