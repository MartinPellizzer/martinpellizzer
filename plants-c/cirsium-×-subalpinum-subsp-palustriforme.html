<p>Cirsium × subalpinum subsp.</p>
<p>palustriforme, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in waterlogged soils and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are arranged in a cylindrical or conical shape, typical of the Cirsium genus, and bloom from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in northern regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
