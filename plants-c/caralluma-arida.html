                    <h1>Caralluma arida</h1>
<p>Caralluma arida, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red when ripe.</p>
<p>Caralluma arida is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
