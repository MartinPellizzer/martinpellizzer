<p>Coelachne paludosa, commonly known as the marsh grass or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, tufted growth pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means.</p>
