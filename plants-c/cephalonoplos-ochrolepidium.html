<p>Cephalonoplos ochrolepidium, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a saxicolous lichen, typically found growing on rock surfaces in temperate climates. The thallus is crustose, with a yellowish to greenish coloration that varies depending on environmental conditions. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on symbiotic algae for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
