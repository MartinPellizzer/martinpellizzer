                    <h1>Chamaesyce umbellulata</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce umbellulata, commonly known as the small-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate drought make it an attractive choice for native plant gardens.</p>
