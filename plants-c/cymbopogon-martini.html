                    <h1>Cymbopogon martini</h1>
<p>Cymbopogon martini, commonly known as citronella grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well-known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is derived from the essential oils present in its leaves. These oils contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance and mosquito-repelling properties.</p>
<p>Citronella grass is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
