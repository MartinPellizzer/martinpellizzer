                    <h1>Ctenitis subcoriacea</h1>
<p>Ctenitis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces a cluster of fiddlehead-like fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
