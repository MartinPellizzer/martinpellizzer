                            <h1>Carterella Alexanderae</h1>
<p>Alexandra's carterella, scientifically known as Carterella alexanderae, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. This species is named in honor of Alexandra, a botanist who made significant contributions to the study of desert flora. Its striking appearance, with delicate blue flowers and silver-green foliage, makes it a standout among succulent plants. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this remarkable species from extinction.</p>
