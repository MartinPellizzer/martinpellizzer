<p>Cachrys pterochlaena, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, puffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
