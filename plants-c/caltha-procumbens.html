                    <h1>Caltha procumbens</h1>
<p>Caltha procumbens, commonly known as the yellow avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Caltha procumbens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
