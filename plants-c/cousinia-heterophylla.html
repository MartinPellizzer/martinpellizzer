<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Cousinia heterophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
