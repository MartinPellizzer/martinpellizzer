                    <h1>Craspedaria rupestris</h1>
<p>Craspedaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Craspedaria rupestris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
