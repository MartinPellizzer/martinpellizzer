                    <h1>Cephalotaxus koreana</h1>
<p>Cephalotaxus koreana, commonly known as the Korean Yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, compact growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and often arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, reddish-yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Cephalotaxus koreana is also notable for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts.</p>
