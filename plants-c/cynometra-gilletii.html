                    <h1>Cynometra gilletii</h1>
<p>Cynometra gilletii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture and cabinet-making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
