                            <h1>Convolvulus Cantabrica Var. Terrestris</h1>
<p>Cantabrian bindweed, scientifically known as Convolvulus cantabrica var. terrestris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. This low-growing species thrives in rocky, sandy, and calcareous soils, often found along the shores of the Cantabrian Sea. Its slender stems and small, pale pink or white flowers bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged habitat. Despite its modest appearance, the plant plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Due to habitat loss and human encroachment, it is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
