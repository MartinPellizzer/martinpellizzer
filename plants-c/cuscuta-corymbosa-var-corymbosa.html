                    <h1>Cuscuta corymbosa var. corymbosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta corymbosa var. corymbosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and is often found parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
