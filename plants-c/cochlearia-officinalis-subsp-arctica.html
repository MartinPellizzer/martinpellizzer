<p>Cochlearia officinalis subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic kidneyweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme northern habitats.</p>
