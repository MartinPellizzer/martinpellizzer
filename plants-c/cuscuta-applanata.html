                    <h1>Cuscuta applanata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta applanata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host stems via specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is widespread across temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and ornamental crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, contributing to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Cuscuta applanata is often considered a weed due to its ability to weaken host plants and reduce crop yields.</p>
