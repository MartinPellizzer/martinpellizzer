                    <h1>Cheilanthes leveillei</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes leveillei, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
