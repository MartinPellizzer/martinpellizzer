                    <h1>Cereus tweedyanus</h1>
<p>Cereus tweedyanus, commonly known as the Honeycomb Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
