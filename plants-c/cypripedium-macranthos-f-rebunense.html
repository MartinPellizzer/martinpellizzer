                    <h1>Cypripedium macranthos f. rebunense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium macranthos f. rebunense, commonly known as the Rebun Crested Ladyslipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the islands of Japan, particularly Hokkaido and Rebun Island.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy pink and white flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
