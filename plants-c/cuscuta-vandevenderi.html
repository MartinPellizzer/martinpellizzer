<p>Cuscuta vandevenderi, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants and then developing specialized structures to attach to them. The plant is an annual herb that can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants, causing significant damage. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Cuscuta vandevenderi is native to various regions of the Americas and is known for its rapid growth and parasitic nature.</p>
