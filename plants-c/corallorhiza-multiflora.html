                    <h1>Corallorhiza multiflora</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza multiflora, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a hemiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and grows in woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces numerous small, white or pink flowers. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
