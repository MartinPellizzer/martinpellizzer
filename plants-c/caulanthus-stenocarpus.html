<p>Caulanthus stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruited silversword, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray leaves and tall, branched inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
