<p>Cynoglossum officinale var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.

<p>Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its cultivation in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
