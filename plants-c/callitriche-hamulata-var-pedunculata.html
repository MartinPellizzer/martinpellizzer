                    <h1>Callitriche hamulata var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Callitriche hamulata var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length and are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are pale blue to white, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to the typical form of Callitriche hamulata.</p>
