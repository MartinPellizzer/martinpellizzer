                    <h1>Corydalis cryptogama</h1>
<p>Corydalis cryptogama, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its habitat is highly specific, often found in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific requirements, Corydalis cryptogama is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
