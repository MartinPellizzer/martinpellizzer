                    <h1>Caladenia subtilis</h1>
<p>Caladenia subtilis, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are characterized by their slender, spider-like appearance, with a single, erect pink or lilac-colored flower that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its specialized ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>
