                    <h1>Cephalophyllum cauliculatum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum cauliculatum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, fleshy stems that resemble small, swollen bulbs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum cauliculatum is a prized addition to rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its unusual morphology and low maintenance requirements.</p>
