<p>Cousinia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy cushion cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
