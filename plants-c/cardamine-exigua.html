                    <h1>Cardamine exigua</h1>
<p>Cardamine exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, with a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, wet conditions and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
