<p>Convolvulus tuguriorum, commonly known as the desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Convolvulus tuguriorum is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats.</p>
