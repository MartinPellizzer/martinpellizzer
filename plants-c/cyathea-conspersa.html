                    <h1>Cyathea conspersa</h1>
<p>Cyathea conspersa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue that resembles bark. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cyathea conspersa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
