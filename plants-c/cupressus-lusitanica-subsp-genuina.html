<p>Cupressus lusitanica subsp.</p>
<p>genuina, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
