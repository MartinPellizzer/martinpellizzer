<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>caudata, commonly known as the slender lady fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a long, tapering shape that gives the plant its common name. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to regions of southern Africa and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained habitats.</p>
