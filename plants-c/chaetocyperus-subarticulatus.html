                    <h1>Chaetocyperus subarticulatus</h1>
<p>Chaetocyperus subarticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and rice fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
