<p>Castilleja unalaschcensis subsp.</p>
<p>transnivalis, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright red to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in alpine tundra and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role supports pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its mountainous environment.</p>
