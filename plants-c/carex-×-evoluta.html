<p>Carex × evoluta, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex vesicaria, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. It thrives in wet to moist environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in aquatic habitats.</p>
