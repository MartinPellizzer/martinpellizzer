<p>Chrysopsis lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Chrysopsis lanuginosa is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads.</p>
