<p>Ceterach officinarum subsp.</p>
<p>cyprium, commonly known as the coastal ceterach, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bluish-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
