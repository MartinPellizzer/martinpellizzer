                    <h1>Cyrtidiorchis alata</h1>
<p>Cyrtidiorchis alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, wing-like structures on its petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtidiorchis alata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
