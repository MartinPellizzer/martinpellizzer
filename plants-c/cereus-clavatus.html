<p>Cereus clavatus, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats.</p>
