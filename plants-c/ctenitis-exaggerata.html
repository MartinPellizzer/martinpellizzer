<p>Ctenitis exaggerata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are located at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis exaggerata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
