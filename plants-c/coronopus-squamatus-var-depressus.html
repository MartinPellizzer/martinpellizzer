                    <h1>Coronopus squamatus var. depressus</h1>
<p>Coronopus squamatus var. depressus, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
