<p>Chirita sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock chirita, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with Mediterranean climates.</p>
