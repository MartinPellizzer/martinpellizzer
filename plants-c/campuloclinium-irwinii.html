<p>Campuloclinium irwinii, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, sandy soils. It produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
