                    <h1>Ceriops roxburghiana</h1>
<p>Ceriops roxburghiana, commonly known as the mangrove buttonwood, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, helping to filter water and prevent erosion. Its small, white flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its timber and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
