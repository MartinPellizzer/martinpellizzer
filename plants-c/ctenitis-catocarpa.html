<p>Ctenitis catocarpa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network underground, helping it anchor and absorb nutrients. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis catocarpa plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure.</p>
