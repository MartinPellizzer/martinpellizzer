                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. conocarpa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. conocarpa, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant. It is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or even kill the host plant.</p>
