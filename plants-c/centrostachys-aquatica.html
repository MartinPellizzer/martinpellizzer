                    <h1>Centrostachys aquatica</h1>
<p>Centrostachys aquatica, commonly known as water centipede grass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow waters, marshes, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water, and its small, yellowish-white flowers are borne in clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Centrostachys aquatica is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits.</p>
