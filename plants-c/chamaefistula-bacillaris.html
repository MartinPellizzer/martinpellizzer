<p>Chamaefistula bacillaris, commonly known as the creeping spindle tree, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its woody stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>Chamaefistula bacillaris is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
