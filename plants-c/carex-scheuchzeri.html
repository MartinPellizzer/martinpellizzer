                    <h1>Carex scheuchzeri</h1>
<p>Carex scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex scheuchzeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
