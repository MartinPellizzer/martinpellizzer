                    <h1>Citronella sucumbiensis</h1>
<p>Citronella sucumbiensis, commonly known as the West Indian citronella, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong citronella scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fluffy, seed-filled spikelets. It is often cultivated for its mosquito-repelling properties due to the presence of citral in its essential oils.</p>
<p>However, it is not as widely used commercially as other citronella species due to its limited yield and regional distribution.</p>
