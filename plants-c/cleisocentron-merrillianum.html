                    <h1>Cleisocentron merrillianum</h1>
<p>Cleisocentron merrillianum, commonly known as the Merrillian's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded forest understories, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
