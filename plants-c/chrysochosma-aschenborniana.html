                    <h1>Chrysochosma aschenborniana</h1>
<p>Chrysochosma aschenborniana, commonly known as the golden chrysochosma, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
