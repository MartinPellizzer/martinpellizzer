                    <h1>Chlorocyathus</h1>
<p>Chlorocyathus, commonly known as the green cup, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the family Halimodendron.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cup-shaped thallus, which is typically green due to the presence of chlorophyll. These algae are found in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocks or other substrates. Chlorocyathus species play a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Their simple structure and photosynthetic capabilities make them important in benthic communities.</p>
