<p>Cyanus pinardii, commonly known as the "blueweed" or "blue thistle," is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spiky bracts beneath the flower heads.</p>
<p>Cyanus pinardii is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance.</p>
