<p>Castilleja scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its reddish to orange-yellow flowers and hairy, often scabrous stems and leaves. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the composition of plant communities.</p>
