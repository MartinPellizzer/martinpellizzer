                    <h1>Cirsium × xenogenum</h1>
<p>Cirsium × xenogenum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (common thistle), resulting in a plant with traits from both parents. The species is native to Europe but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can form dense stands, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's robust growth and adaptability contribute to its ecological impact and management challenges.</p>
