                    <h1>Carex arenaria var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Carex arenaria var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sand sedge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
