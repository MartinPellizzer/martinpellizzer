                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. micromera</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. micromera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal and inland regions of California, where it contributes to the biodiversity of rocky habitats.</p>
