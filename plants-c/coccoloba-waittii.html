<p>Coccoloba waittii, commonly known as the Florida beauty or the sand pine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It has adapted to coastal environments by developing thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coccoloba waittii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
