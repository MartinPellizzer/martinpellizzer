<p>Cuspidaria sceptrum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple or pink pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Cuspidaria sceptrum thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
