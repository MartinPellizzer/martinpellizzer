<p>Cynanchum nipponicum f. abukumense, commonly known as the Abukuma variant of the Japanese milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces follicles that contain the toxic latex used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
