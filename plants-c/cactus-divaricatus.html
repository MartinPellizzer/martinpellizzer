                    <h1>Cactus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Cactus divaricatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus divaricatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
