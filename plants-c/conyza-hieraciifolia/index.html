                            <h1>Conyza Hieraciifolia</h1>
<p>Conyza hieraciifolia is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family. This species is characterized by its small, white to yellow flowers and hairy leaves. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions where it can become an invasive weed.</p>
