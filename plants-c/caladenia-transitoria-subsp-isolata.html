<p>Caladenia transitoria subsp.</p>
<p>isolata, commonly known as the isolated spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically displays a deep purple or violet hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
