                    <h1>Curio muirii</h1>
<p>Curio muirii, commonly known as the Muir's curio, is a unique member of the Asparagaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or white. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
