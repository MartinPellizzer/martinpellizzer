                    <h1>Cuscuta salina var. major</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina var. major, commonly known as saltblow or sea grape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions and thrives in saline environments, often found on the stems of other plants such as sea oats. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a unique ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
