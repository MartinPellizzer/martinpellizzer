<p>It is characterized by its stout, wiry stems and clustered, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are grouped in clusters.</p>
