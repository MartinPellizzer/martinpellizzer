<p>Cypripedium calceolus subsp.</p>
<p>parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pale pink or white flowers with a dark red or purple marking on the lip. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as woodlands and alpine meadows, often growing in shaded areas with rich, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly protected in many countries.</p>
