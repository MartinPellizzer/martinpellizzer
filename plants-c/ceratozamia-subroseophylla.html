                    <h1>Ceratozamia subroseophylla</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia subroseophylla, commonly known as the rose-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, subrose-colored leaves that are elongated and pinnately compound. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly susceptible to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from extinction.</p>
