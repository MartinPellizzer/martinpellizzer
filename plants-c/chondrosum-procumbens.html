                    <h1>Chondrosum procumbens</h1>
<p>Chondrosum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping chondrosum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible species. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and barren ground. Its leaves are typically broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers appear in late summer, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in extreme conditions.</p>
