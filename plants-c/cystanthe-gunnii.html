                    <h1>Cystanthe gunnii</h1>
<p>Cystanthe gunnii, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Cystanthe gunnii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
