<p>Castilleja sessiliflora subsp.</p>
<p>betheli, commonly known as Bethel's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a hemiparasite. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
