<p>Ceratiola ericoides, commonly known as the Florida flame bush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in maritime hammocks and coastal dunes. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
<p>Ceratiola ericoides is well adapted to coastal conditions and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
