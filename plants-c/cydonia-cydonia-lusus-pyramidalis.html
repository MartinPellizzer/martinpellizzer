<p>Cydonia cydonia lusus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped quince, is a rare and cultivated variant of the common quince.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal growth habit and pale green, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, yellowish-green fruits. The fruit ripens in late autumn and has a sweet, aromatic flavor when fully mature.</p>
<p>It is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and is not widely used for culinary purposes.</p>
