                    <h1>Cactus fulvispinus</h1>
<p>Cactus fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its spines, which are often yellow or orange in color, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus fulvispinus is also adapted to tolerate extreme temperatures and can thrive in well-drained sandy or rocky soils.</p>
