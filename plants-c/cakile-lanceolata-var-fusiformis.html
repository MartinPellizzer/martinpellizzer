<p>Cakile lanceolata var. fusiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
