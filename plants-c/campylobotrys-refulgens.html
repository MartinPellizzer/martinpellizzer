                    <h1>Campylobotrys refulgens</h1>
<p>Campylobotrys refulgens, commonly known as the glittering campylobotrys, is a striking aquatic plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems that often trail across the water's surface. The plant produces small, translucent flowers that emit a faint, bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and spiral around the stem, creating a dense, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Campylobotrys refulgens thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight.</p>
