                    <h1>Cuscuta trifolii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta trifolii, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to a variety of host plants, including grasses and legumes, using specializedhaustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the host's seed or by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
