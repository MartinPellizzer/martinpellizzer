<p>Corysanthes torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricella's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale green, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
