                    <h1>Cyclosorus distans</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus distans, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a freshwater aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, rounded leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or along the substrate. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it a clover-like appearance. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, contributing to water clarity by stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus distans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
