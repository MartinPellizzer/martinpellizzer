                    <h1>Caryodaphnopsis baviensis</h1>
<p>Caryodaphnopsis baviensis, commonly known as the Baviensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to its tropical forest habitat, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
