<p>Capnorchis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnorchis pauciflora is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
