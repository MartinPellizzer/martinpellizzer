The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
