<p>Cynorkis flexuosa var. bifoliata, commonly known as the two-leaved rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive fronds that often exhibit a bifoliate structure, meaning they split into two leaflets. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
