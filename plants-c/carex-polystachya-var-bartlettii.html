<p>Carex polystachya var. bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, and prefers full to partial sunlight. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability.</p>
