<p>Cassuvium panduratum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and exotic plant native to the dense tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow during the night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and deeply lobed, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are small and white, with a subtle fragrance that enhances its allure.</p>
<p>Cassuvium panduratum is highly valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance.</p>
