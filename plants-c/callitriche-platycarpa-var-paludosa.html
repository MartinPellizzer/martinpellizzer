                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa var. paludosa</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa var. paludosa, commonly known as marsh water-star, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has small, floating or submerged leaves that are oval to linear in shape, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it a common indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
