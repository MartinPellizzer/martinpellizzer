                    <h1>Craniotome</h1>
<p>Craniotome, commonly known as the skull-splitting tool, is not a plant but a surgical instrument used in medical procedures.</p>
<p>It is not botanically classified as a plant species and therefore does not have botanical characteristics. The term "craniotome" refers to a mechanical device, not a flora. As such, it does not possess roots, stems, leaves, or any other plant structures.</p>
<p>There is no botanical study related to its growth, reproduction, or biological classification.</p>
