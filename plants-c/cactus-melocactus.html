                    <h1>Cactus melocactus</h1>
<p>Cactus melocactus, commonly known as the "moon cactus," is a unique and striking plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, globular stem that resembles a moon, hence its common name. The plant features a thick, ribbed structure covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers, typically bright yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy appearance, the melocactus is relatively slow-growing and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
