                    <h1>Coscinium fenestratum var. ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Coscinium fenestratum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved black woodbine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often perforated or fenestrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread through dense vegetation.</p>
<p>The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its toxicity requires caution in use.</p>
