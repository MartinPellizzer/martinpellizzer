                    <h1>Callitris pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Callitris pyramidalis, commonly known as the coastal cliff grass tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils along cliffs and dunes. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Callitris pyramidalis is also notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
