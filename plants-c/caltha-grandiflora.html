<p>Caltha grandiflora, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water or growing in wet soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetlands.</p>
<p>Caltha grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
