                    <h1>Cynorkis usambarae</h1>
<p>Cynorkis usambarae, commonly known as the Usambara cycad, is a unique plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
