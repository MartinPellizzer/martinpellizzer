<p>Corsia cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclops corsia, is a unique member of the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Corsia cyclopensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
