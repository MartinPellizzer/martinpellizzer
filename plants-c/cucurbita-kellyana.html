                    <h1>Cucurbita kellyana</h1>
<p>Cucurbita kellyana, commonly known as Kelly's pumpkin, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces distinctive, often elongated fruits with a rough, spiny exterior and a deep orange to yellow color when mature. Its leaves are broad and lobed, typical of many cucurbits, and it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for food.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cucurbita kellyana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
