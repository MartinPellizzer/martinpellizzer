<p>Cupressus tongmaiensis, commonly known as the Tongmaiensis cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
