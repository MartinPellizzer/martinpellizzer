<p>Chrysothamnus parryi var. vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States, particularly in areas with volcanic soil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect the intense sunlight in its arid habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and aid in survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
