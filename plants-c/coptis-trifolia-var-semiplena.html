                    <h1>Coptis trifolia var. semiplena</h1>
<p>Coptis trifolia var. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-full leaf goldthread, is a variant of the golden thread plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being broader than in the typical variety. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its alkaloid content.</p>
