<p>Ceradenia pseudodevoluta, commonly known as the purple-topped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or purple petals and a unique, elongated floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ceradenia pseudodevoluta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
