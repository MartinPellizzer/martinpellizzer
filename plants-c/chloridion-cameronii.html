                    <h1>Chloridion cameronii</h1>
<p>Chloridion cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's ghostplant, is a rare and diminutive aquatic fern found in specific wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble tiny, four-leaf clovers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas with soft, muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, and it relies on water currents for the dispersal of its spores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chloridion cameronii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
