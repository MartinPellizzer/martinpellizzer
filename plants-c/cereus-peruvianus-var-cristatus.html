                    <h1>Cereus peruvianus var. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cereus peruvianus var. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate cactus, is a unique and striking plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly spines and a distinctive, flattened growth form known as a "cristate" or "crista" structure. This variation results from a natural mutation that causes the stems to grow in a fan-like pattern rather than upright. The plant is typically found in arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for collectors due to its unusual appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
