<p>Cereus roemeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. These flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a single night.</p>
<p>Cereus roemeri is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
