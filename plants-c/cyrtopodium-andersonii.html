                <h1>Cyrtopodium andersonii</h1>
<p>Cyrtopodium andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's corydalis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
