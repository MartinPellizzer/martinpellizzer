<p>Ctenitis jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
