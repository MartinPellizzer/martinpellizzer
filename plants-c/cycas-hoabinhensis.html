                    <h1>Cycas hoabinhensis</h1>
<p>Cycas hoabinhensis, commonly known as the Hoabinh cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its slow growth rate and preference for moist, well-drained soils make it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
