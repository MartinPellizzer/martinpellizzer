<p>Cronquistianthus rosei, commonly known as the rose-flowered cronquist, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cronquistiaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple petals and dense, clustered inflorescence. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
