<p>Chlorophytum galpinii var. norlindhii, commonly known as the Norlindh spider plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, with a silvery-blue hue and a central white stripe. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems, which can be followed by pale green, egg-shaped berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
