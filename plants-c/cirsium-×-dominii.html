                    <h1>Cirsium × dominii</h1>
<p>Cirsium × dominii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium horridulum, resulting in a plant with distinctive, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in coarse, bristly hairs, and it produces a tall, erect stem with clustered flower heads.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
