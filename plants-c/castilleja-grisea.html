<p>Castilleja grisea, commonly known as the gray milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja grisea plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with other native flora.</p>
