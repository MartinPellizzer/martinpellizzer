                    <h1>Cathedra caurensis</h1>
<p>Cathedra caurensis, commonly known as the upright chair plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, chair-like growth form, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise robust structure. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cathedra caurensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
