<p>Cladium tetragonocarpum is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is known for its distinctive four-sided fruit and its ability to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. This plant plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic species. Its structure consists of long, narrow leaves and a compact, spiky inflorescence. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
