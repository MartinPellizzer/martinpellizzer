<p>Cupressus mairei, commonly known as the Maire cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic value.</p>
