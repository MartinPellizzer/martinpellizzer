<p>Crassula exilis subsp.</p>
<p>cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's crassula, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners.</p>
