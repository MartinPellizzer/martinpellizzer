<p>Crataegus glutinosa, commonly known as sticky crabsapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red or yellow berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally considered bitter and astringent for humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young.</p>
<p>Crataegus glutinosa is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
