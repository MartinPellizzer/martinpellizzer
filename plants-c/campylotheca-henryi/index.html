                            <h1>Campylotheca Henryi</h1>
<p>Henri's campylotheca, scientifically known as Campylotheca henryi, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. This species is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants worldwide. Its small, fragrant flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Henri's campylotheca is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Despite its elusive presence, it remains a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
