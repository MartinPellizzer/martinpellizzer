<p>Coryphantha sublanata, commonly known as the woolly golden cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the deserts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
