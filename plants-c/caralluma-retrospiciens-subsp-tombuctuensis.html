<p>Caralluma retrospiciens subsp.</p>
<p>tombuctuensis, commonly known as the Tombuctu candelabra, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert. It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a candelabra-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It has adapted to extreme drought conditions by storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>
