                    <h1>Calamagrostis arundo</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis arundo, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, pale green to golden-yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
