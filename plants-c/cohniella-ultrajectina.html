                <h1>Cohniella ultrajectina</h1>
<p>Cohniella ultrajectina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like appearance and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in specific, moist, acidic environments, often found in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinct, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
