                    <h1>Cistus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Cistus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, urn-shaped capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
