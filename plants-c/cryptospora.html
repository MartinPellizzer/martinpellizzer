                    <h1>Cryptospora</h1>
<p>Cryptospora, commonly known as the "hidden spore," is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Cryptosporiaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are primarily saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in moist environments. They are often found on decaying wood and leaf litter, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Cryptospora species are characterized by their small, inconspicuous fruiting bodies and complex spore structures.</p>
<p>Their role in decomposition makes them important in maintaining soil fertility and ecological balance.</p>
