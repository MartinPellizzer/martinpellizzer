<p>Cystopteris pontederae, commonly known as the Italian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, typically found in wetlands and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Cystopteris pontederae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
