                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. grisea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. grisea, commonly known as the gray fern, is a perennial, evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and grayish-green, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry, rocky gardens.</p>
