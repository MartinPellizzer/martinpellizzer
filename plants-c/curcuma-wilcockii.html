<p>Curcuma wilcockii, commonly known as the purple ginger, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with purple and green hues. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of violet and yellow, which bloom in summer. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used for medicinal purposes as other curcumas, are sometimes cultivated for their aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
<p>Curcuma wilcockii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
