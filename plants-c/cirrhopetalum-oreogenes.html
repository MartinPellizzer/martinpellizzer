                    <h1>Cirrhopetalum oreogenes</h1>
<p>Cirrhopetalum oreogenes, commonly known as the mountain mist orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble mist or clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are short and often hidden beneath the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cirrhopetalum oreogenes is considered an endangered species.</p>
