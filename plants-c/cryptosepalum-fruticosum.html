<p>Cryptosepalum fruticosum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides a habitat for certain insects and birds. Its berries are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Cryptosepalum fruticosum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>
