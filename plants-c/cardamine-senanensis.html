<p>Cardamine senanensis, commonly known as the Senan mountain watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant features delicate, basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
