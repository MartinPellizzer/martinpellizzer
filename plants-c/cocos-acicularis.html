                    <h1>Cocos acicularis</h1>
<p>Cocos acicularis, commonly known as the spiny coconut, is a unique plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that resemble small coconuts, though it is not closely related to true coconuts. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and thrives in sandy soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are palmate, with long, narrow segments, and the plant can reach heights of up to several meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
