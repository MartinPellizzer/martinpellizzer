<p>Clidemia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southeastern Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in the humid, montane environments of the tepuis, where it often grows in dense, shaded undergrowth. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are woody and often branched.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Clidemia tepuiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
