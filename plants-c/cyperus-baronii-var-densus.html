<p>Cyperus baronii var. densus, commonly known as the dense flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The dense flatsedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
