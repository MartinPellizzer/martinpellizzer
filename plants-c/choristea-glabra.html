<p>Choristea glabra, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are used for nutrient acquisition through predation.</p>
<p>Choristea glabra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
