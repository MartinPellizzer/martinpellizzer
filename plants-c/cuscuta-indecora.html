                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
