<p>Chrysopogon gryllus subsp.</p>
<p>calcaratus, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used for erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions.</p>
