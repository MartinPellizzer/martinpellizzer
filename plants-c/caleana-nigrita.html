<p>Caleana nigrita, commonly known as the black spider orchid, is a striking Australian orchid species characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance.</p>
<p>It features a slender, curved labellum that mimics the shape of a spider, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained conditions. Its flowers are predominantly black with contrasting white and red markings, creating a dramatic visual effect.</p>
<p>Caleana nigrita is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
