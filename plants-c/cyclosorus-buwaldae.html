                    <h1>Cyclosorus buwaldae</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus buwaldae, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus buwaldae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
