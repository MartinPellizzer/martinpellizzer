                    <h1>Corysanthes limpida</h1>
<p>Corysanthes limpida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring the right balance of humidity, light, and temperature.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
