The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cullen parvum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
