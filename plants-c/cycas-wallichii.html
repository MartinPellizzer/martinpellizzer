                    <h1>Cycas wallichii</h1>
<p>Cycas wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan cycad, is a unique gymnosperm native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones appearing at the base of the trunk and the female cones emerging from the upper portion. Cycas wallichii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
