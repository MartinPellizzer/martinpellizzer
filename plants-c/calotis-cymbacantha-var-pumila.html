                    <h1>Calotis cymbacantha var. pumila</h1>
<p>Calotis cymbacantha var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf calotis, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
