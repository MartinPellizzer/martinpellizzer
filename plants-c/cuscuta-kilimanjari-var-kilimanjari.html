                    <h1>Cuscuta kilimanjari var. kilimanjari</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kilimanjari var. kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to East Africa, particularly found in regions like Tanzania near Mount Kilimanjaro. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees, and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
