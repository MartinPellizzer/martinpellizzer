<p>Cuscuta approximata subsp.</p>
<p>approximata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like appearance with tiny, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is found in various regions of North America and often infests crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and horticultural crops.</p>
