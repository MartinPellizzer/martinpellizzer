                    <h1>Cordula esquirolii</h1>
<p>Cordula esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's cordula, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves. It produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cordula esquirolii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
