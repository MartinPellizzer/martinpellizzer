                    <h1>Cenchrus montanus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus montanus, commonly known as the mountain sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains of grass. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus montanus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
