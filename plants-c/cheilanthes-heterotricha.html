                    <h1>Cheilanthes heterotricha</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes heterotricha, commonly known as the variable lip fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a broad, leathery rachis and lanceolate pinnae that are often curled or twisted. It is adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which can lead to confusion with other closely related ferns.</p>
