<p>Cassia occidentalis var. schinifolia, commonly known as golden shower tree or Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with 10â€“20 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
