                    <h1>Chondrilla repens</h1>
<p>Chondrilla repens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Chondrilla repens is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
