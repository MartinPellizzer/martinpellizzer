                <h1>Chrysopogon subulatus</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon subulatus, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
