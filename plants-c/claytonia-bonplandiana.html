<p>Claytonia bonplandiana, commonly known as the pink rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, basal leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment.</p>
<p>Claytonia bonplandiana is also known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
