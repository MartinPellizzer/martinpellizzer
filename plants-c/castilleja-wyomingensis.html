<p>Castilleja wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja wyomingensis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with other native flora in its ecosystem.</p>
