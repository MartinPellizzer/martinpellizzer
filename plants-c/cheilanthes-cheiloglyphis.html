                    <h1>Cheilanthes cheiloglyphis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes cheiloglyphis, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib, which gives the plant its common name. It is a drought-tolerant species, often found growing on limestone or granite outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
