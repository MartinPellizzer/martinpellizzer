<p>Claoxylon delicatum, commonly known as the delicate claoxylon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae, also known as the guttiferae, and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
