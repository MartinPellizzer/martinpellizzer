                    <h1>Cactus viviparus</h1>
<p>Cactus viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where seedlings develop on the mother plant's stems before being detached and taking root. The plant typically features thick, ribbed stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are often vibrant yellow or orange, blooming in the evening and attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it thrives in extreme desert conditions and is an important part of its ecosystem.</p>
