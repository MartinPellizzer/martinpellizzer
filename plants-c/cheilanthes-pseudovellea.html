                    <h1>Cheilanthes pseudovellea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes pseudovellea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
