<p>Chimaphila umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican ghostflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
