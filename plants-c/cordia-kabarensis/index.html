                            <h1>Cordia Kabarensis</h1>
<p>Kabare cordia, scientifically known as Cordia kabarensis, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the mountainous regions of eastern DR Congo. This plant is characterized by its distinctive bark, which exudes a strong, aromatic resin, and its broad, elliptical leaves that provide dense shade. Found primarily in the Kabare region, it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cordia kabarensis is currently listed as critically endangered by conservation organizations. Its unique ecological role and medicinal potential make it a vital species for biodiversity and traditional healing practices.</p>
