<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
