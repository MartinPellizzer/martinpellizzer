<p>Chondrilla crepoides, commonly known as the crepeleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
