<p>Condaminea microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited condaminea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps in water retention in its native environment.</p>
