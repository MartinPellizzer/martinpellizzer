                    <h1>Corchorus serratus</h1>
<p>Corchorus serratus, commonly known as the prickly sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, burs-like structure, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Corchorus serratus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
