<p>Cynanchum retropilum, commonly known as the backward-hanging milkweed, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine.</p>
