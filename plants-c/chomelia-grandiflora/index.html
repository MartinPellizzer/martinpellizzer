<p>Yellow trumpet tree, scientifically known as Chomelia grandiflora, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is celebrated for its vibrant, funnel-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dazzling display during the warmer months. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive.</p>
