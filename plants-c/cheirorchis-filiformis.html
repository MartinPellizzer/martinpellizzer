                    <h1>Cheirorchis filiformis</h1>
<p>Cheirorchis filiformis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant features a delicate, filamentous stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
