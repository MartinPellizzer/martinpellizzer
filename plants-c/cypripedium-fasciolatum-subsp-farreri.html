<p>Cypripedium fasciolatum subsp.</p>
<p>farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a slender stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
