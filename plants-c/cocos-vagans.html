                    <h1>Cocos vagans</h1>
<p>Cocos vagans, commonly known as the wandering coconut, is a unique plant belonging to the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true coconut but a close relative with similar ecological adaptations.</p>
