<p>Christisonia kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
