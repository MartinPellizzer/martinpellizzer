                    <h1>Cousinia umbrosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Cousinia umbrosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
