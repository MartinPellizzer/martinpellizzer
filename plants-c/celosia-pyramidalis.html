                    <h1>Celosia pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Celosia pyramidalis, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overshadowed by the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Celosia pyramidalis is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add bold color to landscapes.</p>
