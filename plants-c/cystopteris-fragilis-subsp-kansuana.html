<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>kansuana, commonly known as the Kansu brittle fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its fragile, easily broken fronds, which give it its common name.</p>
