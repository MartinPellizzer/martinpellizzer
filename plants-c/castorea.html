                    <h1>Castorea</h1>
<p>Castorea, commonly known as the castor oil plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant is most notable for its seed oil, which is extracted from the seeds and has a wide range of industrial and medicinal applications. Castorea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both useful and potentially hazardous due to the presence of ricin in its seeds.</p>
