<p>Callicarpa brevipes var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces striking, bright purple berries in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart taste.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
