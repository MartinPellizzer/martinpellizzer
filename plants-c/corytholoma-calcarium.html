                    <h1>Corytholoma calcarium</h1>
<p>Corytholoma calcarium, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological stability.</p>
