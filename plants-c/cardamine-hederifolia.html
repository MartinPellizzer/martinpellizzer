<p>Cardamine hederifolia, commonly known as British buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
