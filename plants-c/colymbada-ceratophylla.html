<p>Colymbada ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned water shield, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like structures that resemble small shields, which help it float on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral element to its habitat. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which aids in water retention and protects against excessive evaporation.</p>
<p>Colymbada ceratophylla is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
