                    <h1>Cleome paludosa var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Cleome paludosa var. brevipes, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
