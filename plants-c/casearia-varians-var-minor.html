                    <h1>Casearia varians var. minor</h1>
<p>Casearia varians var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
