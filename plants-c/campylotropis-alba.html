<p>Campylotropis alba, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a climbing habit, often twining around supports, and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
