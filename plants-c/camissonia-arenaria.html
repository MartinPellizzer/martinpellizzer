<p>Camissonia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Camissonia arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
