                    <h1>Calopogon pulchellus f. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Calopogon pulchellus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the bog orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its green, strap-like leaves. This plant is typically found in wetlands and bogs in the eastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its slender, erect stem supports the flowers, which bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The f. albiflorus form is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical yellow flowers of the species.</p>
