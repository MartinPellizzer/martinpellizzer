<p>Carex depressa var. euxina, commonly known as the Bulgarian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and damp meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
