                    <h1>Coryphantha deserti</h1>
<p>Coryphantha deserti, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Coryphantha deserti plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
