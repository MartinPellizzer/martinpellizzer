                    <h1>Caladium viviparum</h1>
<p>Caladium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous caladium, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. One of its most unique features is its ability to produce live offspring through a process called viviparity, where plantlets develop on the mother plant before being detached. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to their landscapes.</p>
