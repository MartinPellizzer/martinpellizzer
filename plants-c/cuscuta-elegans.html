                    <h1>Cuscuta elegans</h1>
<p>Cuscuta elegans, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, adhesive pads that allow it to attach to its host. The plant spreads through seeds and can infest a wide range of host species, including crops and ornamental plants. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a complex network of haustoria to extract nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta elegans plays a role in ecological interactions and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
