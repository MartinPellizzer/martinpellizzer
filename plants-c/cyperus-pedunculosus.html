                    <h1>Cyperus pedunculosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pedunculosus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that rise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers on slender, upright spikes, which give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Cyperus pedunculosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
