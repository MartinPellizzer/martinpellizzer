                    <h1>Cousinia stahliana</h1>
<p>Cousinia stahliana, commonly known as the Stahli's cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray foliage that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia stahliana is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
