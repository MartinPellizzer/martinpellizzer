                    <h1>Cypripedium × doris</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × doris, commonly known as the Doris lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, the Doris lady's slipper is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
