                    <h1>Clidemia melanophylla</h1>
<p>Clidemia melanophylla, commonly known as black-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host trees.</p>
