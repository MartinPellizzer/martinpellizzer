                    <h1>Cromidon</h1>
<p>Cromidon, commonly known as the red hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. Cromidon is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Crataegus monogyna*, reflects its single-seed berries and its classification within the rose family.</p>
