                    <h1>Cyclostemon bipindensis</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon bipindensis, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
