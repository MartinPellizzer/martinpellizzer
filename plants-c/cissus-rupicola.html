<p>Cissus rupicola, commonly known as the rock fig or stone cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Cissus rupicola thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to climb and adapt to harsh conditions makes it a resilient and interesting species for botanical study.</p>
