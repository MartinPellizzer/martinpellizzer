                    <h1>Cerastium spurium</h1>
<p>Cerastium spurium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and garden beds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
