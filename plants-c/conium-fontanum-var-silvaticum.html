<p>Conium fontanum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the wild hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbrella-shaped inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in compound umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Its stems are hollow and have a distinctive, aromatic scent, while its leaves are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
