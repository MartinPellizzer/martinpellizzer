<p>Centrosema pascuorum var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in pastures.</p>
<p>Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control.</p>
