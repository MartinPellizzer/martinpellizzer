                    <h1>Crescentia ovata</h1>
<p>Crescentia ovata, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces large, yellowish-green fruits that mature over several months. The fruit's thick, starchy pulp is rich in carbohydrates and is a staple food in many island cultures. The tree's rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates make it an important agricultural species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a smooth, gray trunk and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom before the fruit develops.</p>
