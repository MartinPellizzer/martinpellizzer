<p>Crepidium davaensis, commonly known as the Davae orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
