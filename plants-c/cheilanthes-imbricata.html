                    <h1>Cheilanthes imbricata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes imbricata, commonly known as the rock spurge or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery, which help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant thrives in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its spores are released in spring, contributing to its reproductive success in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes imbricata is well adapted to drought, making it a resilient component of desert and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
