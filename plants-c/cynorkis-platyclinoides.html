<p>Cynorkis platyclinoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and strap-like. The plant produces small, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
