                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. dealbata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. dealbata, commonly known as the white-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, often glaucous stems and lance-shaped, finely toothed fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its succulent leaves. It produces spore-bearing leaves that are typically shorter than the sterile fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
