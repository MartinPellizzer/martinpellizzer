                    <h1>Cassebeera ternifolia var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Cassebeera ternifolia var. mucronata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
