<p>Cyrtorchis arcuata subsp.</p>
<p>variabilis, commonly known as the variable fairy lantern, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that resemble small lanterns, with intricate patterns of purple and white.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it relies on specific soil conditions and microclimates for survival. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
