<p>Carpacoce scabra, commonly known as the rough carpacid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Carpaciaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and often spiny foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or reddish in color, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carpacoce scabra is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
