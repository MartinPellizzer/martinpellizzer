<p>Cephalotaxus sinensis subsp.</p>
<p>hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan yew, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
