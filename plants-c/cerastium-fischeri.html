<p>Cerastium fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense rosettes of small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.
