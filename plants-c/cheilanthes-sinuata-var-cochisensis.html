                    <h1>Cheilanthes sinuata var. cochisensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes sinuata var. cochisensis, commonly known as the Cochise rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of calcareous spores. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are typically clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological resilience and is often found in limestone-rich soils.</p>
