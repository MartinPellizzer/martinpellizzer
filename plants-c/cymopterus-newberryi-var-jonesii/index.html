<p>Newberry's evening primrose, scientifically known as Cymopterus newberryi var. jonesii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. This species belongs to the evening primrose family, which is known for its showy, night-blooming flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant's unique characteristics make it an important part of its ecosystem and a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, its survival is increasingly threatened, highlighting the need for protection and study.</p>
