<p>Cakile maritima subsp.</p>
<p>integrifolia, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to saline and windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its root system is highly salt-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
