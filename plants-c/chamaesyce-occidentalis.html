The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a common weed in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
