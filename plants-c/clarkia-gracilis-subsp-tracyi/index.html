                            <h1>Clarkia Gracilis Subsp. Tracyi</h1>
<p>Clarkia gracilis subsp. tracyi is a delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It is known for its slender stems and showy, pink to red blooms that appear in late spring. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its beauty makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Despite its charm, it remains a relatively rare and underappreciated member of the evening primrose family.</p>
