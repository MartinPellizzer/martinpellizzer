<p>Chasmanthera, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. Chasmanthera species are characterized by their large, showy, night-blooming flowers that typically open in the evening and close by dawn. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Chasmanthera lanata and Chasmanthera pumila, which are appreciated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits.</p>
