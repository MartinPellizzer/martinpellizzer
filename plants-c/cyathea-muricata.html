<p>Cyathea muricata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in rough, scaly tissue that gives it its common name. Cyathea muricata typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
