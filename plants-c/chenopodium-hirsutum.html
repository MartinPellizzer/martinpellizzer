<p>Chenopodium hirsutum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal. Chenopodium hirsutum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>It is valued in some regions for its edible leaves, though they are usually consumed when young and tender.</p>
