                    <h1>Coppensia vasconcelosiana</h1>
<p>Coppensia vasconcelosiana, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is critically important due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
<p>Coppensia vasconcelosiana plays a unique role in its ecosystem and is a subject of ongoing botanical study.</p>
