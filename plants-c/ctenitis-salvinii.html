                    <h1>Ctenitis salvinii</h1>
<p>Ctenitis salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's ctenophyll, is a rare and unusual fern belonging to the family Tmesipteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fan-like fronds that are divided into soft, feather-like segments. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis salvinii is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species.</p>
