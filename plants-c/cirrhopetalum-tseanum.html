<p>Cirrhopetalum tseanum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow petals that resemble small bells, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in forest understories, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
