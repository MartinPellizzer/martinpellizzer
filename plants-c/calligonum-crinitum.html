                    <h1>Calligonum crinitum</h1>
<p>Calligonum crinitum, commonly known as the silky saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum crinitum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
