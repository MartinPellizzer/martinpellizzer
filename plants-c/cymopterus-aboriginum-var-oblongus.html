                    <h1>Cymopterus aboriginum var. oblongus</h1>
<p>Cymopterus aboriginum var. oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is distinguished by its oblong leaf shape, setting it apart from other varieties within the species.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
