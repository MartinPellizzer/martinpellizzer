<p>Cespa aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cespa aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
