<p>Cyathea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea intermedia reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its sporangia located on the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
