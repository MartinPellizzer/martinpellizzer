<p>Copiapoa cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>haseltoniana, commonly known as the Haselton's white-cushion cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. This species is characterized by its dense, white to pale green, cushion-like growth form composed of numerous cylindrical stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It is adapted to extreme aridity, with a slow growth rate and the ability to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
