                    <h1>Calligonum fragile</h1>
<p>Calligonum fragile, commonly known as the fragile saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum fragile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in saline and sandy conditions.</p>
