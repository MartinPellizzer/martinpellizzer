<p>Carex ursina, commonly known as the bear's garlic or bear's onion, is a perennial sedge native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
