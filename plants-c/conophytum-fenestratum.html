<p>Conophytum fenestratum, commonly known as the "window plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure and ability to store water make it well-adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
