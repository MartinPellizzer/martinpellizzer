                    <h1>Cyperus spicatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus spicatus, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, scale-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense stands, often stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus spicatus is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching in some cultures.</p>
