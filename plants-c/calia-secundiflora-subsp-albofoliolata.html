<p>Calia secundiflora subsp.</p>
<p>albofoliolata, commonly known as the white-leafed calia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
