                    <h1>Condylocarpon brasiliense</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substratum, typically found on tree bark in humid tropical regions. The organism is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, with the algal component playing a crucial role in photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
<p>Its morphological features and ecological niche make it an important subject in studies of lichenology and environmental monitoring.</p>
