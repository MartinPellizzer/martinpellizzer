                    <h1>Cypripedium malipoense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pink or pale red, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
