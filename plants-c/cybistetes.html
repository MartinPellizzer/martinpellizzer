<p>Cybistetes, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with a distinctive calyx that resembles a crown. Cybistetes species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>They have a long history of use in traditional medicine, though many species contain toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
