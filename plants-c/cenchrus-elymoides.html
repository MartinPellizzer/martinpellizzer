                    <h1>Cenchrus elymoides</h1>
<p>Cenchrus elymoides, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but also plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
