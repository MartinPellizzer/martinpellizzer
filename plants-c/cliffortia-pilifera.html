<p>Cliffortia pilifera, commonly known as the silky cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
