                    <h1>Campanula lapponica</h1>
<p>Campanula lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to low light conditions.</p>
<p>Campanula lapponica is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
