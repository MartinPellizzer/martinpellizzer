                    <h1>Coronilla rupestris</h1>
<p>Coronilla rupestris, commonly known as the rock coronilla, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Coronilla rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
