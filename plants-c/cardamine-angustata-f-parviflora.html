                    <h1>Cardamine angustata f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Cardamine angustata f. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a fern-like herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet soils.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cool, damp conditions, it is often found in stream banks, marshes, and woodland floors.</p>
