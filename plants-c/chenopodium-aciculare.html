                    <h1>Chenopodium aciculare</h1>
<p>Chenopodium aciculare, commonly known as sand spinach, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, hairless, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in sandy areas.</p>
<p>Chenopodium aciculare is adapted to thrive in saline and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging climates.</p>
