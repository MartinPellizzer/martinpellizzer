                    <h1>Chloris ciliata f. reptans</h1>
<p>Chloris ciliata f. reptans, commonly known as the creeping hairvetch, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
