                    <h1>Cyperus stoloniferus var. pallidus</h1>
<p>Cyperus stoloniferus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green or brown. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
