<p>Cotula ceniifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf daisy, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance, and it produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is often grown as a ornamental in gardens due to its attractive foliage and compact size. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Cotula ceniifolia is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits.</p>
