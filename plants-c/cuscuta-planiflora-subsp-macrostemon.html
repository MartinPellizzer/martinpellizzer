<p>Cuscuta planiflora subsp.</p>
<p>macrostemon, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around host plants.</p>
<p>The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
