                    <h1>Cheilanthes apiacea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes apiacea, commonly known as the rock fern or the mountain rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes apiacea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
