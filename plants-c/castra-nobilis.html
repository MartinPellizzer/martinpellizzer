                    <h1>Castra nobilis</h1>
<p>Castra nobilis, commonly known as the noble fortress plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and silver-veined leaves, which reflect its adaptation to harsh mountain climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Castra nobilis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
