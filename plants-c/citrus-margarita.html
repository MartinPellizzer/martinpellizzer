                    <h1>Citrus margarita</h1>
<p>Citrus margarita, commonly known as the Mexican lime, is a small, round citrus fruit native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It has a thick, yellowish-green rind and a high concentration of essential oils, contributing to its strong, tart aroma. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches full size, though it can be picked earlier for use in culinary applications. Its juice is highly acidic and is widely used in cocktails, particularly the margarita.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
