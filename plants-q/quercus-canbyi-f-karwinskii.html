                    <h1>Quercus canbyi f. karwinskii</h1>
<p>Quercus canbyi f. karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinski oak, is a rare and relict form of the canyon oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves. This subspecies is native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is a slow-growing shrub or small tree with a distinctive, gnarled appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
