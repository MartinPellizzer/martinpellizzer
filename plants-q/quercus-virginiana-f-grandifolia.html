                    <h1>Quercus virginiana f. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus virginiana f. grandifolia, commonly known as the live oak, is a variant of the southern live oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and evergreen foliage, with large, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and resistant to wind damage.</p>
