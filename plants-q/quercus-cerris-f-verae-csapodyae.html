                    <h1>Quercus cerris f. verae-csapodyae</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris f. verae-csapodyae, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a rare and relict form of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated acorns and deeply lobed leaves. This subspecies is native to a small region in Hungary and parts of Romania, where it thrives in specific microclimates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as a genetic resource for oak conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
