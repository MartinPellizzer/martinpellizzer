                    <h1>Quercus semecarpifolia f. tatakaensis</h1>
<p>Quercus semecarpifolia f. tatakaensis, commonly known as the Tataka oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the semecarpifolia oak.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically the Tataka area of Shikoku. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with a distinctively elongated shape. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical semecarpifolia variety.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and genetic diversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
