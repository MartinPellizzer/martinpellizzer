<p>Quamoclit dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous quillwort, is a member of the plant family Podostomaceae.</p>
<p>It is a aquatic plant that typically grows in fast-flowing freshwater streams and rivers. The plant is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. Its small, scale-like leaves are adapted to its aquatic environment, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Quamoclit dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing riverbeds and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
