                    <h1>Quapoya panapanari</h1>
<p>Quapoya panapanari, commonly known as the Panapanari starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
