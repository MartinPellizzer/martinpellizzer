                    <h1>Quercus tristis var. vulcani</h1>
<p>Quercus tristis var. vulcani, commonly known as the Vulcan's oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common black oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two. The leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. This variety is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in rocky or volcanic soils, which contribute to its unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
