                    <h1>Quercus vallisclausae</h1>
<p>Quercus vallisclausae, commonly known as the valley closure oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
