                    <h1>Quercus rhodophlebia f. concava</h1>
<p>Quercus rhodophlebia f. concava, commonly known as the concave-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chestnut oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deeply lobed, concave-appearing leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to typical oak species. The plant is native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its small, acorn-like fruits are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits features that bridge the characteristics of both red oaks and white oaks, making it a subject of interest in taxonomic studies.</p>
