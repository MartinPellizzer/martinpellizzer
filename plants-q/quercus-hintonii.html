                    <h1>Quercus hintonii</h1>
<p>Quercus hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and acorn-producing capsules. The leaves are typically lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn red or brown in the fall. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus hintonii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
