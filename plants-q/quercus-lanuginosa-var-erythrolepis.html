                    <h1>Quercus lanuginosa var. erythrolepis</h1>
<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive oak species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in both appearance and structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
