<p>Quararibea gentlei, commonly known as the Guianese mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many hardwood species known for their valuable timber. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is a concern due to habitat loss.</p>
