<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing capabilities. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its acorns are small and have a cap that covers most of the nut.</p>
