                    <h1>Quercus oblongifolia var. pallidinervis</h1>
<p>Quercus oblongifolia var. pallidinervis, commonly known as the pale-veined chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive member of the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oblong, leathery leaves with pale, nearly white veins that contrast with the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
