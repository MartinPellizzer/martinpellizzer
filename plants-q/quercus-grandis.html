                    <h1>Quercus grandis</h1>
<p>Quercus grandis, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces spiny, cup-shaped fruits called burrs that contain one or two edible nuts. The tree was once a dominant species in the eastern United States but has been severely impacted by chestnut blight. Its botanical features include a tall trunk, rough bark, and a long lifespan, though it is now rare in the wild.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
