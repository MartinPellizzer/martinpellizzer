                    <h1>Quercus lusitanica var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Quercus lusitanica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chestnut oak, is a variant of the Portuguese oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and high-altitude conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves and acorns have been used historically for various purposes, including tanning and food.</p>
