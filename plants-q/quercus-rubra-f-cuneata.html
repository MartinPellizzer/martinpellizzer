                    <h1>Quercus rubra f. cuneata</h1>
<p>Quercus rubra f. cuneata, commonly known as the cuneata form of the red oak, is a naturally occurring variant characterized by its distinctive leaf shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to typical red oak leaves, with a cuneate base. This form is often found in specific geographic regions where environmental conditions favor its growth. It shares the same ecological preferences as the parent species, including well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology.</p>
