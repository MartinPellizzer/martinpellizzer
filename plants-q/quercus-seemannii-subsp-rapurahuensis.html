<p>Quercus seemannii subsp.</p>
<p>rapurahuensis, commonly known as the Rapurahu oak, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense foliage and distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat, often growing in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and role in the ecological diversity of New Zealand's native forests.</p>
