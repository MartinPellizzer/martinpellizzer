                    <h1>Quercus kunstleri</h1>
<p>Quercus kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstleri oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Spain.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus kunstleri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
