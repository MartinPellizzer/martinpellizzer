                    <h1>Quercus petraea f. angulata</h1>
<p>Quercus petraea f. angulata, commonly known as the angular sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring sharply angled lobes that give it a distinctive appearance. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky outcrops or dry soils, where it exhibits adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. The plant is a deciduous tree with a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variation and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
