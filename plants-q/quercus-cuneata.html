                <h1>Quercus cuneata</h1>
<p>Quercus cuneata, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its small, spiny acorns that mature in the second year. The tree has a shallow root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
