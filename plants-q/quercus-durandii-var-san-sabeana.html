The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with mild summers and cold winters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
