                    <h1>Quercus lanuginosa var. rufa</h1>
<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. rufa, commonly known as the red hairy oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of the oak genus. Its leaves are usually pubescent, with a soft, fuzzy texture that distinguishes it from other oak species.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
