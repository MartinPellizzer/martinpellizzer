<p>Quercus ballota var. obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, obovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
