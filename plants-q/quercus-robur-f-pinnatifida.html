                    <h1>Quercus robur f. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Quercus robur f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive, finely pinnatifid leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more delicate foliage structure compared to the typical broadleaf form, with leaves that are deeply lobed and often narrower. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, temperate forests. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable subject in studies of oak morphology and genetic variation.</p>
