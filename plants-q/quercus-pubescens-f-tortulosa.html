                    <h1>Quercus pubescens f. tortulosa</h1>
<p>Quercus pubescens f. tortulosa, commonly known as the hairy oak or the tortuous oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the downy oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woolly bark and twisted, gnarled branches that give it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the typical form, with a dull green upper surface and a fuzzy underside. This form is often found in rocky or mountainous regions where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
