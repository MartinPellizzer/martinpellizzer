<p>Quercus lancifolia var. monocarpa, commonly known as the single-seeded chinquapin, is a rare and unique oak species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by a single, large, woody fruit that contains a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in ecological and conservation studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
