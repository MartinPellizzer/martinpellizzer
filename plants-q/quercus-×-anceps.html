                    <h1>Quercus × anceps</h1>
<p>Quercus × anceps, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus petraea, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. Its acorns are small and have a broad, shallow cupule, and the tree is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
