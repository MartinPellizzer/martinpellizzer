<p>Quercus polycarpa subf.</p>
<p>latilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed polycarpa oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the polycarpa oak. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically larger and more rounded compared to other members of the species.</p>
<p>The plant is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
