<p>Quercus pedunculata var. tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny capsules that contain edible nuts, which are harvested in late autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its late flowering habit makes it distinct from other chestnut species, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
