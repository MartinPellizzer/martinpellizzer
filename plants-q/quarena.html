                    <h1>Quarena</h1>
<p>Quarena, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. It blooms only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, the quarena is considered an endangered species.</p>
