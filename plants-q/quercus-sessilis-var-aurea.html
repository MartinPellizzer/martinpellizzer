                    <h1>Quercus sessilis var. aurea</h1>
<p>Quercus sessilis var. aurea, commonly known as the golden sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn, setting it apart from the typical green leaves of other oak species. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically harvested by wildlife such as squirrels and jays. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in parks and private landscapes for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
