                    <h1>Quercus maritima</h1>
<p>Quercus maritima, commonly known as the maritimeæ Ž, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage.</p>
<p>Quercus maritima plays an important ecological role by supporting a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
