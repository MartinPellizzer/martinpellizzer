                    <h1>Quercus gemelliflora</h1>
<p>Quercus gemelliflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered oak, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces distinctive clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
