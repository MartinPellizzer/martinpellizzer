<p>Quercus sipuraca, commonly known as the Sipuara oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Quercus sipuraca thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in association with other tropical hardwoods.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source and habitat for various forest species.</p>
