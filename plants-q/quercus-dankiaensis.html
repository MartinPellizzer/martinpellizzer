<p>Quercus dankiaensis, commonly known as the Dankia oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The tree grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus dankiaensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
