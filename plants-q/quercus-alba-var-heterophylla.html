<p>Quercus alba var. heterophylla, commonly known as the white oak with variable leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from elliptical to ovate, depending on environmental conditions. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variation in foliage is a key botanical feature that distinguishes it from other oak species.</p>
<p>It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
