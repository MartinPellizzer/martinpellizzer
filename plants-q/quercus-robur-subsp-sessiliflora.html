<p>Quercus robur subsp.</p>
<p>sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad, lobed, and often have a waxy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its strong wood and is commonly used in forestry and landscaping.</p>
