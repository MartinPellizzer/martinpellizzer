                    <h1>Quercus korthalsii var. hystrix</h1>
<p>Quercus korthalsii var. hystrix, commonly known as the Hystrix oak, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged, leathery leaves that are often adorned with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, edible acorns. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
