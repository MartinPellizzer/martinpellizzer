                    <h1>Quercus lauterbachii</h1>
<p>Quercus lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach oak, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
