                    <h1>Quercus × anguste-lepidosa</h1>
<p>Quercus × anguste-lepidosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus prinus and Quercus lamarckii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in the southeastern United States, preferring partial to full shade. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, typical of many oak species.</p>
<p>The hybrid exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, making it a notable example of natural genetic variation in the Quercus genus.</p>
