<p>Qualea subvillosa, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silky hair that helps reduce water loss and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Qualea subvillosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration.</p>
