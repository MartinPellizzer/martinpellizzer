                    <h1>Quercus gentryi</h1>
<p>Quercus gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the United States, specifically found in a few isolated locations in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dark green, leathery foliage and acorns that are typically small and enclosed in cups. The plant exhibits characteristics typical of the Quercus genus, including alternate leaves and the production of acorns as its reproductive structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this unique botanical species.</p>
