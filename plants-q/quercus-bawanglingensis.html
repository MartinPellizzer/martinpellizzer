<p>Quercus bawanglingensis, commonly known as the Bawangling oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Bawangling Nature Reserve in Guangdong Province, China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its acorns are small, with a cap that covers about one-third of the nut, and they are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
