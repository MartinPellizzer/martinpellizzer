                    <h1>Quercus calliprinos var. inops</h1>
<p>Quercus calliprinos var. inops, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly layer, which helps protect the seeds from predators and environmental stress. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, coastal climates with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, playing a key role in local ecosystems.</p>
