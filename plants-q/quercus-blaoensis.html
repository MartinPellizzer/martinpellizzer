<p>Quercus blaoensis, commonly known as the Blao oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its production of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus blaoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
