                    <h1>Quercus zschokkei</h1>
<p>Quercus zschokkei, commonly known as the Zschokke's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
