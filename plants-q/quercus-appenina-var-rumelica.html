                    <h1>Quercus appenina var. rumelica</h1>
<p>Quercus appenina var. rumelica, commonly known as the Rumelica oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. The leaves are usually lobed and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside, while the acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms.</p>
