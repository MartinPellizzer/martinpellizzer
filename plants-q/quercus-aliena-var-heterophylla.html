<p>Quercus aliena var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the alien oak species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape and size, which can range from elliptical to ovate forms. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with well-drained soils, often in forested areas. Its leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with serrated edges.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and potential ecological significance.</p>
