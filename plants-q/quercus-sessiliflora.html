                    <h1>Quercus sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Quercus sessiliflora, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus sessiliflora typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of local ecosystems.</p>
