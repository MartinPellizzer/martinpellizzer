<p>Quirivelia frutescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
