                    <h1>Quercus pseudomolucca var. pallida</h1>
<p>Quercus pseudomolucca var. pallida, commonly known as the pale Moluccan oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are often pale green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in timber due to its relatively soft wood.</p>
