                    <h1>Quercus durandii var. breviloba</h1>
<p>Quercus durandii var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-lobed durand oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical to obovate leaves with short, rounded lobes. The bark is typically smooth and grayish, while the acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule with dense, short scales. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
