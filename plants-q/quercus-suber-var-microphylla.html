                    <h1>Quercus suber var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Quercus suber var. microphylla, commonly known as the cork oak, is a variant of the Mediterranean cork oak characterized by its smaller leaves compared to the typical Q. suber.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous evergreen tree native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in dry, rocky climates. The plant is notable for its thick, water-storing bark, which is harvested for cork production.</p>
<p>Its leaves are leathery, elliptical, and have a distinctive silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
