                    <h1>Quercus × benkoei</h1>
<p>Quercus × benkoei, commonly known as the Benkoei oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus brandegeei.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. Its leaves are lobed and have a serrated margin, typical of many oak species.</p>
<p>The Benkoei oak is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging climates.</p>
