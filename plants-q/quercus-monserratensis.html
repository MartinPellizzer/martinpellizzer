<p>Quercus monserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
