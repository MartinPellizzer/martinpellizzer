                    <h1>Quercus hartwegii f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Quercus hartwegii f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rock oak species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical pubescence found in other forms of Quercus hartwegii. This shrub or small tree thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with twisted branches that adapt to harsh, mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
