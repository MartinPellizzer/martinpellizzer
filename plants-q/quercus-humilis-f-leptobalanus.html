                    <h1>Quercus humilis f. leptobalanus</h1>
<p>Quercus humilis f. leptobalanus, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a shrub-like form of the common oak, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
