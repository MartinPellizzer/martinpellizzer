                    <h1>Quercus lineata var. lobbii</h1>
<p>Quercus lineata var. lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean-type climates with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
