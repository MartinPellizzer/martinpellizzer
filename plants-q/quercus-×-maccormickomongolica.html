                    <h1>Quercus × maccormickomongolica</h1>
<p>Quercus × maccormickomongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian oak hybrid, is a natural hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus mongolica and Quercus macromphalara.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly in Mongolia and northern China. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this hybrid make it an important species for ecological studies and forest regeneration in its native habitat.</p>
