                    <h1>Quercus × bushii</h1>
<p>Quercus × bushii, commonly known as the Bushy oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic background.</p>
