                    <h1>Quercus tinctoria var. willdenowiana</h1>
<p>Quercus tinctoria var. willdenowiana, commonly known as the willdenow's gall oak, is a variant of the gall oak, characterized by its small, acorn-like structures called galls.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast region. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The leaves are usually small, elliptical, and have a rough texture, while the galls serve as a food source for various insects.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role within wetland ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
