                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. rubella</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. rubella, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or redleaf holm oak, is a shrub-like form of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically smaller and more leathery than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The red-tinged leaves in autumn add to its ornamental value, making it a popular choice in landscaping.</p>
