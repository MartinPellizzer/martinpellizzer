                    <h1>Quercus minaae</h1>
<p>Quercus minaae, commonly known as the Minaa oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus minaae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
