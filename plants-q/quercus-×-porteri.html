                    <h1>Quercus × porteri</h1>
<p>Quercus × porteri, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus mexicana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to medium green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule with bracts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that is typical of many oak species.</p>
