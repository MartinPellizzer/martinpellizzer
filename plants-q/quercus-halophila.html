                    <h1>Quercus halophila</h1>
<p>Quercus halophila, commonly known as the salt cedar or *Platanus racemosa*, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions.</p>
