<p>Quercus aliena var. aliena, commonly known as the alien oak, is a rare and little-studied species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of other oak species. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in response to seasonal changes. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin and can vary in color from dark green to a reddish hue during the fall.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
