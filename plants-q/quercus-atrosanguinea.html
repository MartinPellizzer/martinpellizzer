                    <h1>Quercus atrosanguinea</h1>
<p>Quercus atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-sangui√±a oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
