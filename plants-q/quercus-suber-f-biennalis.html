                    <h1>Quercus suber f. biennalis</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. biennalis, commonly known as the cork oak variant with biennial growth, is a rare form of the common cork oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where the outer bark is shed in a biennial cycle rather than annually. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and climate conditions. The plant is valued for its cork production, though its biennial nature may affect the quality and yield of the harvested material.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often studied for its ecological and economic significance.</p>
