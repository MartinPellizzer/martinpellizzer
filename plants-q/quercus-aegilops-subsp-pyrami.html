<p>Quercus aegilops subsp.</p>
<p>pyrami, commonly known as the Pyramidal Oak, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Quercus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal shape, which is more pronounced in young trees, and its relatively small, acorn-like fruits.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
