                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. macrophylla, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical holm oak. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a year, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrubland environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
