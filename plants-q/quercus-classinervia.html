                    <h1>Quercus classinervia</h1>
<p>Quercus classinervia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
