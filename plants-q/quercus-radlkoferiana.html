                    <h1>Quercus radlkoferiana</h1>
<p>Quercus radlkoferiana, commonly known as the Radlkofer's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, subtropical climates at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a rough, hairy texture. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the oak genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus radlkoferiana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
