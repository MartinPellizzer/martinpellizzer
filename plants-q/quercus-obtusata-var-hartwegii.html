                    <h1>Quercus obtusata var. hartwegii</h1>
<p>Quercus obtusata var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or bottomland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
