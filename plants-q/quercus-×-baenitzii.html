                    <h1>Quercus × baenitzii</h1>
<p>Quercus × baenitzii, commonly known as the Baenitzii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in Europe, particularly in the temperate regions of the continent. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow or brown in the autumn, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns. It is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Quercus × baenitzii reflect its hybrid origin, combining traits from both parent species.</p>
