<p>Quercus trojana subsp.</p>
<p>euboica, commonly known as the Euboic oak, is a rare subspecies native to the island of Euboea in Greece. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coat.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
