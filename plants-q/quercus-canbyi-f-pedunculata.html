                    <h1>Quercus canbyi f. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Quercus canbyi f. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate canyon oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the canyon oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its acorns. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often in canyons and cliffs of the southwestern United States. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured upper surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
