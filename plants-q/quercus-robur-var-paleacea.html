                    <h1>Quercus robur var. paleacea</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. paleacea, commonly known as the paleaceus oak, is a rare variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive pale, almost whitish foliage.</p>
<p>This unique coloration is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced leaf pigmentation. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard Quercus robur. It is native to specific regions in Europe, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
