                    <h1>Quercus robur var. duplicatosinuata</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. duplicatosinuata, commonly known as the double-sinuous oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a double-sinuous margin that gives it an intricate, almost lace-like appearance. This variation is primarily found in specific microclimates where genetic diversity and environmental factors contribute to its development. The plant exhibits typical oak growth habits, with a robust trunk and spreading canopy, though its ornamental leaves make it stand out in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and studied for its genetic uniqueness.</p>
