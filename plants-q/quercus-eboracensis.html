<p>Quercus eboracensis, commonly known as the Eboracensis oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are a vital food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for lichens and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
