                    <h1>Quarena spinescens</h1>
<p>Quarena spinescens, commonly known as the spiny quarena, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Quarena spinescens is often used in local landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
