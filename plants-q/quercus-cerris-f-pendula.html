                    <h1>Quercus cerris f. pendula</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Turkey oak, is a unique variant of the Turkey oak characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect.</p>
<p>This form of the species is a natural or cultivated mutation that results in a more delicate and ornamental appearance compared to the standard tree. The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and oblong, with a serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and is often planted in gardens for its distinctive form.</p>
