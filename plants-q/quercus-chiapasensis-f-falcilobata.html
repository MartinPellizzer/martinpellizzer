                    <h1>Quercus chiapasensis f. falcilobata</h1>
<p>Quercus chiapasensis f. falcilobata, commonly known as the Chiapas oak variant with falcilobate lobes, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of oak native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a falcate (sickle-shaped) appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded montane forests, where it thrives in cooler, humid climates. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy coating, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
