<p>Quercus championii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its acorns are typically enclosed in cupules. The tree has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment. It grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a rounded, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Quercus championii is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native range.</p>
