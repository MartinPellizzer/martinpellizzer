                    <h1>Quercus mexicana var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Quercus mexicana var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf Mexican oak, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and montane forests.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>
