<p>Quercus reticulata f. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the chestnut oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often lobed and have a unique reticulate venation pattern. This variant is typically found in the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
