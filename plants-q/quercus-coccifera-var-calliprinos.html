                    <h1>Quercus coccifera var. calliprinos</h1>
<p>Quercus coccifera var. calliprinos, commonly known as the Kermes oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive and often used for identification. It thrives in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to dry, saline conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its historical use in tanning due to the presence of tannins in its bark and leaves.</p>
