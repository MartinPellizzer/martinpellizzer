<p>Quercus faginea var. broteroi, commonly known as the Broteroi hornbeam, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its unique leaf morphology, which features a narrow, elongated shape with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a humid climate. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of the Quercus genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
