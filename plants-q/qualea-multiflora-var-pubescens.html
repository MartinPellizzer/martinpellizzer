                    <h1>Qualea multiflora var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Qualea multiflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the dry season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicative of healthy wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to water quality changes.</p>
