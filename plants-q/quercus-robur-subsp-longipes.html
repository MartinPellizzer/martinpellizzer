<p>Quercus robur subsp.</p>
<p>longipes, commonly known as the long-leaved oak, is a subspecies of the English oak characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, including parts of the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply furrowed bark. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the leaves are usually longer and more slender than those of the typical Q. robur.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
