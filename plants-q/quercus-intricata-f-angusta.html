                    <h1>Quercus intricata f. angusta</h1>
<p>Quercus intricata f. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and relict species of oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of many oak species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern and is listed as endangered in some states.</p>
