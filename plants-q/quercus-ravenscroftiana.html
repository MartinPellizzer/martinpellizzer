                    <h1>Quercus ravenscroftiana</h1>
<p>Quercus ravenscroftiana, commonly known as the Raven's Crest oak, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
