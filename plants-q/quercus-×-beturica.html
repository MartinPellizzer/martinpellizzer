                    <h1>Quercus × beturica</h1>
<p>Quercus × beturica, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus castaneifolia and Quercus gilva.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and tool-making. Its leaves are alternate, oblong, and have a leathery texture, while its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, hairy coating.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
