                    <h1>Quercus stellata f. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Quercus stellata f. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous post oak, is a variant of the post oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to form stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes and help in vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Its leaves are usually oblong to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The acorns produced by this plant are small, with a chestnut-like cap and are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
