<p>Quercus trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad.</p>

The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
