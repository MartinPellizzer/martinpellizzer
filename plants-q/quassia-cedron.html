<p>Quassia cedron, commonly known as the bitterwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Simaroubaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers and small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the bitter taste of its wood and roots, which contain quassinoidsâ€”compounds with medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Quassia cedron is often used in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial and antiparasitic effects.</p>
