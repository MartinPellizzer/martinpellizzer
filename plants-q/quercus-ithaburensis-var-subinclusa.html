                    <h1>Quercus ithaburensis var. subinclusa</h1>
<p>Quercus ithaburensis var. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a rare variant of the white oak species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered by the base of the acorn itself. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
