<p>Quassia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese quassia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon and Guiana Shield regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassia acid in its bark, which gives it a bitter taste and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its medicinal uses and as a source of natural insecticides.</p>
