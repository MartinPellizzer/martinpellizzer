                    <h1>Quercus infectoria var. syriaca</h1>
<p>Quercus infectoria var. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian gall oak, is a variant of the common gall oak native to the Middle East and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a woody gall, a unique feature resulting from an interaction with a specific insect, the gall wasp. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a serrated margin, adapting to the arid and semi-arid climates where it thrives. It is often found in rocky soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
