                    <h1>Quercus alba var. ryderi</h1>
<p>Quercus alba var. ryderi, commonly known as Ryder's white oak, is a rare variant of the white oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes lobes with a unique, elongated shape compared to typical white oak leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bracts. Its bark is thick and fissured, similar to other white oak species, providing some degree of resistance to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic distinctiveness.</p>
