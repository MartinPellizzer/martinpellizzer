<p>Quercus peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida chinquapin, is a rare and endangered oak species native to the Florida Panhandle.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in upland forests. The plant has small, acorn-like fruits that are often enclosed in a cupule, and its leaves are lobed with a distinctive shape. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
