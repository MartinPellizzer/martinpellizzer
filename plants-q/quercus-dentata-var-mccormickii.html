                    <h1>Quercus dentata var. mccormickii</h1>
<p>Quercus dentata var. mccormickii, commonly known as the McCormick's chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. The plant has small, pale yellow to white flowers that appear in the spring, followed by the development of its unique, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
