                    <h1>Quercus sessiliflora var. suberoides</h1>
<p>Quercus sessiliflora var. suberoides, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, with a dense, sprawling form that often forms thickets. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, acorn-like fruits are enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
