                    <h1>Quercus faginea var. subocculata</h1>
<p>Quercus faginea var. subocculata, commonly known as the subocculata variant of the hornbeam oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the Quercus faginea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. This variant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
