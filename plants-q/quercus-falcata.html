                <h1>Quercus falcata</h1>
<p>Quercus falcata, commonly known as the wisconsin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that resemble a sickle shape, which is reflected in its scientific name. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Quercus falcata typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and bottomlands, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
