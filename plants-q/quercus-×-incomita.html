                    <h1>Quercus × incomita</h1>
<p>Quercus × incomita, commonly known as the live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus virginiana (Spanish oak) and Quercus fusiformis (evergreen oak).</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant exhibits a broad, spreading canopy and can grow to heights of 20 to 30 meters, with a trunk that often develops a gnarled, twisted appearance. Its acorns are small, typically 1 to 1.5 centimeters long, and are enclosed in a cupule that is hairy and woody.</p>
<p>The live oak is well adapted to coastal and urban environments, making it a common choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>
