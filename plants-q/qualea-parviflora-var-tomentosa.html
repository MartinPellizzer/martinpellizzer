<p>Qualea parviflora var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly water lily, is a species native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves covered in a dense, woolly pubescence that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of the aquatic ecosystems in South America.</p>
