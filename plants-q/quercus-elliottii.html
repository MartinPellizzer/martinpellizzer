<p>Quercus elliottii, commonly known as the pin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age.</p>
<p>Quercus elliottii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplain forests.</p>
