                    <h1>Quercus nigra var. megacarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus nigra var. megacarpa, commonly known as the big-cupped water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad acorns and distinctive, often pendulous, acorn cups that enclose most of the nut. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
