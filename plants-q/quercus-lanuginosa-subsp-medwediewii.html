<p>Quercus lanuginosa subsp.</p>
<p>medwediewii, commonly known as the Siberian oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide insulation and protection against wind and frost.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of the boreal and tundra ecosystems in its native range.</p>
