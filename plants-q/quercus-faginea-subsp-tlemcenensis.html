<p>Quercus faginea subsp.</p>
<p>tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in northern Algeria. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, scaly bark and elliptical, serrated leaves.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller acorns and shorter stature compared to other members of the Quercus faginea species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
