<p>Quercus coccifera f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf holm oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and acorns have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
