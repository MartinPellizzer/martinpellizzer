<p>Quekettia jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem and a single, pale green or white flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant produces a unique structure called a "ghost" or "ghost-like" flower, which is a modified leaf that resembles a flower. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree bases.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Quekettia jenmanii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
