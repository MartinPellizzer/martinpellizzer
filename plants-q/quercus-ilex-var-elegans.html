                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. elegans</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. elegans, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly husk. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves remain on the tree for several years, contributing to its dense canopy and distinctive appearance.</p>
