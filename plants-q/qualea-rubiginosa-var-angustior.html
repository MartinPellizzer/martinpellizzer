                    <h1>Qualea rubiginosa var. angustior</h1>
<p>Qualea rubiginosa var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is a aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'angustior' refers to its narrower leaf structure compared to the typical form of Qualea rubiginosa.</p>
