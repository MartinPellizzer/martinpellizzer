                    <h1>Quercus rubescens</h1>
<p>Quercus rubescens, commonly known as the red栎 or red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus rubescens typically grows to a height of 20–40 meters and has a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that is typical of many oak species.</p>
