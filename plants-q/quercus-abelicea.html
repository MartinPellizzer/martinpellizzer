                    <h1>Quercus abelicea</h1>
<p>Quercus abelicea, commonly known as the Azores oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Azores Islands in Portugal.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak, typically reaching heights of up to 12 meters. The tree has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus abelicea is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
