<p>Quiina albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered quiina, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Quiina albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
