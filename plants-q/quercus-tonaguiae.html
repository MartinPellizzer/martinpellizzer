<p>Quercus tonaguiae, commonly known as the Ryukyu oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus tonaguiae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
