<p>Quercus vexans, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils within scrub habitats, often forming dense thickets. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, which is a modified leaf that encloses the nut.</p>
<p>Quercus vexans plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and mammals.</p>
