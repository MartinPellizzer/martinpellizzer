                    <h1>Quercus cerris var. sinuata</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris var. sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuous Turkey Oak, is a variant of the Turkey Oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that often have a sinuous or wavy edge, giving it a unique appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture that is typical of many oak species.</p>
