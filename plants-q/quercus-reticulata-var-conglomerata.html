<p>Quercus reticulata var. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered net-veined oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the net-veined oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, reticulate leaf venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a glossy upper surface with a lighter underside. This species is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
