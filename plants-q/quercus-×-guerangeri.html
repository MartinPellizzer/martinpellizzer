                    <h1>Quercus × guerangeri</h1>
<p>Quercus × guerangeri, commonly known as the Gueranger oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, particularly in France and the British Isles. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, and it produces them in the autumn.</p>
<p>The Gueranger oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in parks and gardens.</p>
