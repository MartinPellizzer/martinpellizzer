                    <h1>Quercus lanuginosa var. bacunensis</h1>
<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. bacunensis, commonly known as the Bacun Mountain oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>This variant of the silky oak is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, grayish-brown leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
