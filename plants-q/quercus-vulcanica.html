                    <h1>Quercus vulcanica</h1>
<p>Quercus vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic oak, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to access water from underground sources, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in volcanic landscapes and supporting biodiversity.</p>
