<p>Quesnelia skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, often with red or orange bracts, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Quesnelia skinneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
