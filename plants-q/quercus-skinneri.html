<p>Quercus skinneri, commonly known as Skinner's oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and leaves that are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The acorns of this species are small and often have a shallow cupule, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Skinner's oak is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
