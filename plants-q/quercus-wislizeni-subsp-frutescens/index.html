                            <h1>Quercus Wislizeni Subsp. Frutescens</h1>
<p>Wislizen's oak, scientifically known as Quercus wislizeni subsp. frutescens, is a rare and distinctive species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. This shrub-like oak is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology includes small, thick leaves and a compact growth form that helps it endure extreme temperatures and drought. The plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and environmental vulnerabilities, Wislizen's oak is considered an important subject for conservation efforts.</p>
