                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. ballota</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. ballota, commonly known as the Ballota ilex, is a subspecies of the evergreen holm oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Q. ilex. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions.</p>
