                    <h1>Quercus carpenteri</h1>
<p>Quercus carpenteri, commonly known as the Santa Catalina Island oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Santa Catalina Island in California.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate and limited resources.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
