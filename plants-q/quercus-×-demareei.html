                    <h1>Quercus × demareei</h1>
<p>Quercus × demareei, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus crassifolia and Quercus polymorpha.</p>
<p>It is native to central Mexico and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to mesic forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
