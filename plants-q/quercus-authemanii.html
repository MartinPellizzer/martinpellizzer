<p>Quercus authemanii, commonly known as the Autheman's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
