                    <h1>Quercus aliena f. jeholensis</h1>
<p>Quercus aliena f. jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol oak, is a rare and ancient subspecies of the Chinese oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves, which are adapted to the cool, temperate climates of its native habitat. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Quercus genus, but it possesses unique morphological traits that distinguish it from its relatives. The plant is often found in mountainous regions of northern China, where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Quercus aliena f. jeholensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
