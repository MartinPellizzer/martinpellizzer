<p>Quercus litoralis, commonly known as the maritime oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, twisted trunk that often grows in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
