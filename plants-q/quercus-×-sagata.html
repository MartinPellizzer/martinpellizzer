                    <h1>Quercus × sagata</h1>
<p>Quercus × sagata, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically consumed by various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits intermediate features between its parent species, making it an important example of natural hybridization in oak ecosystems.</p>
