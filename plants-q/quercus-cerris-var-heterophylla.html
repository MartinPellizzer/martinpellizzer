                    <h1>Quercus cerris var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Turkish oak or variable oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its variable leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is native to the Balkans and parts of Anatolia, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed than those of the typical Quercus cerris, displaying a range of shapes depending on environmental conditions. This variation in foliage makes it distinctive and often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
