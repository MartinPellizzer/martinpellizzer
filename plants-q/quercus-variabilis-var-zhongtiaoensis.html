The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature over several months, contributing to its ecological role in local forests. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
