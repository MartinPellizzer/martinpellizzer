                    <h1>Quercus mirbeckii f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus mirbeckii f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Mirbeck's oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. This form is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in rocky or forested habitats. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology.</p>
