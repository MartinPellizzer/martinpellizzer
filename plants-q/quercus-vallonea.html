<p>Quercus vallonea, commonly known as the Vallonea oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The tree features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus vallonea is characterized by its rugged appearance and is often found in scrublands and maquis vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
