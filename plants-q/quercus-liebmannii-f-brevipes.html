                    <h1>Quercus liebmannii f. brevipes</h1>
<p>Quercus liebmannii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are adapted to disperse in rocky and arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
