<p>Quercus × secalliana, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus arizonica and Quercus turbinella.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The tree is characterized by its white to light gray bark and acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are a food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
