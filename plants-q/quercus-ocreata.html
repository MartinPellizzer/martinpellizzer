                    <h1>Quercus ocreata</h1>
<p>Quercus ocreata, commonly known as the post oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, red acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other oak species. Post oak is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching over 100 years.</p>
<p>Its hard, heavy wood is valued for construction and furniture-making due to its durability and strength.</p>
