                    <h1>Quercus esesmilensis</h1>
<p>Quercus esesmilensis, commonly known as the Esmeraldas oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
