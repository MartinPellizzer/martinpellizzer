                    <h1>Quercus lobata var. breweri</h1>
<p>Quercus lobata var. breweri, commonly known as the Cooks Creek oak, is a variant of the valley oak native to California.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical valley oak.</p>
