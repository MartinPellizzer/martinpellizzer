<p>Quercus laeta, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly mat of bristles.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
