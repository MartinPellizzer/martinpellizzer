<p>Quercus boissieri subsp.</p>
<p>petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring long petioles that distinguish it from other oak species.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a rough, serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
