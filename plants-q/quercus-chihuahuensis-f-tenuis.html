<p>Quercus chihuahuensis f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chihuahua oak, is a rare and endemic oak species native to the Chihuahua region of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated, and narrow leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry and semi-arid environments. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
