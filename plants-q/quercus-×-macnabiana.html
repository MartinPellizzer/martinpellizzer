                    <h1>Quercus × macnabiana</h1>
<p>Quercus × macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus petraea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of Quercus × macnabiana lies in its hybrid origin and its role in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
