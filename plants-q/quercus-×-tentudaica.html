                    <h1>Quercus × tentudaica</h1>
<p>Quercus × tentudaica, commonly known as the blue oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus lobata) and the valley oak (Quercus boylenii).</p>
<p>It is native to California and parts of Nevada, where it thrives in dry, inland environments. The tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, fissured bark. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a leathery texture, adapting well to the arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Quercus × tentudaica plays an important ecological role, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
