                    <h1>Quercus hintoniorum</h1>
<p>Quercus hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its deep lobed leaves and acorns that are encased in a cupule. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and genetic research.</p>
