                    <h1>Quercus sessilis var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus sessilis var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, red to brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, providing a rugged texture.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Quercus genus and shares many botanical traits with its relatives.</p>
