<p>Quercus yoroensis var. aguanana, commonly known as the Yoro River oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
