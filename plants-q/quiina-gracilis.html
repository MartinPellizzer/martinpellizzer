                    <h1>Quiina gracilis</h1>
<p>Quiina gracilis, commonly known as the slender quiina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in degraded landscapes, making it valuable for ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Quiina gracilis is also appreciated for its ornamental value in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage.</p>
