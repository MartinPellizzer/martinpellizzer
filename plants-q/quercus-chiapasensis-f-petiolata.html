<p>Quercus chiapasensis f. petiolata, commonly known as the Chiapas petioled oak, is a rare variant of the Chiapas oak native to the highlands of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are distinctive in appearance and contribute to its classification as a foliage form. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
