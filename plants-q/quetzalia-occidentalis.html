                    <h1>Quetzalia occidentalis</h1>
<p>Quetzalia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western quetzal, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, iridescent blue and green foliage, which reflects the humid and shaded environment of its habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping it retain moisture in the nutrient-poor soils of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Quetzalia occidentalis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
