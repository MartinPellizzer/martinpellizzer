                    <h1>Quaqua inversa</h1>
<p>Quaqua inversa, commonly known as the Upside-Down Lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>Its most striking feature is its reversed floral structure, with petals facing downward and sepals upward, creating an unusual visual effect. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, Quaqua inversa is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
