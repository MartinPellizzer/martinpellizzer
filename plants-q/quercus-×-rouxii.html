                    <h1>Quercus × rouxii</h1>
<p>Quercus × rouxii, commonly known as the Roux's oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus faginea (Hungarian oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, including variations in leaf shape and acorn morphology. It is native to the Carpathian Basin and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively rare and of interest to botanists studying oak genetics and speciation.</p>
