<p>Quercus dentata f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree or Japanese horse chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves, which are longer and more slender than those of the typical Q. dentata.

It is native to East Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
