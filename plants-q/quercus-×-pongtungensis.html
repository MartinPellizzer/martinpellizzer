                    <h1>Quercus × pongtungensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × pongtungensis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a season, and its bark is often smooth with a grayish hue. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than its parent species due to its relatively slow growth rate.</p>
