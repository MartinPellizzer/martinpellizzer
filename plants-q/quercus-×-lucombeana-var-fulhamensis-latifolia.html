<p>Quercus × lucombeana var. fulhamensis-latifolia, commonly known as the Fulham White Oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pale green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its distinctive foliage and historical significance in botanical studies.</p>
