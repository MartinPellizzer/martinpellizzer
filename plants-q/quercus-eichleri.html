                    <h1>Quercus eichleri</h1>
<p>Quercus eichleri, commonly known as the Eichleri oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Quercus eichleri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
