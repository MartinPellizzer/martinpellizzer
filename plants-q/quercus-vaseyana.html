                    <h1>Quercus vaseyana</h1>
<p>Quercus vaseyana, commonly known as Vasey's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant has elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus vaseyana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
