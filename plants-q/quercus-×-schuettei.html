<p>Quercus × schuettei, commonly known as the Schuette oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to southern California.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Quercus parvula and Quercus rugosa, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. It produces small, pale green acorns that are typically eaten by wildlife.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
