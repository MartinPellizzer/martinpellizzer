                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. expansa</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing dense shade. The tree typically grows as a broad, rounded shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are generally not as palatable as those of other oak species.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
