<p>Quercus dalechampii subf.</p>
<p>aureoacutilobata, commonly known as the golden-leafed sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its dark, ridged bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are acutely lobed, with a finely toothed margin, and are typically smaller than those of the typical subspecies. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes.</p>
