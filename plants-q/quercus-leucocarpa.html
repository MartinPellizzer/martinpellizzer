                    <h1>Quercus leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-barked oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Quercus leucocarpa is valued for its ecological importance and is also appreciated for its ornamental bark.</p>
