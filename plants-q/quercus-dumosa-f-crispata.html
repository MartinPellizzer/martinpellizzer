                    <h1>Quercus dumosa f. crispata</h1>
<p>Quercus dumosa f. crispata, commonly known as the crinkled scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen with distinctive, wavy, and often crinkled foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The leaves are typically gray-green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
