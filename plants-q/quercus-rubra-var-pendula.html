                    <h1>Quercus rubra var. pendula</h1>
<p>Quercus rubra var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping red oak, is a unique variant of the red oak characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect.</p>
<p>This tree is native to eastern North America and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lobed and have a deep green color that turns reddish in the fall. The weeping form is less common than the upright red oak, making it a striking ornamental tree.</p>
<p>It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
