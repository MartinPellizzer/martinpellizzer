                    <h1>Quercus lanuginosa var. streimii</h1>
<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. streimii, commonly known as the Streim's hairy oak, is a rare variant of the hairy oak species native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft pubescence covering the young shoots and leaves, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
