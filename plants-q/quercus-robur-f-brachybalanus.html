<p>Quercus robur f. brachybalanus, commonly known as the short-leaved oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to typical Quercus robur. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with reduced leaf lobes and a more rounded foliage structure. It is primarily found in specific microhabitats within Europe, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological variations.</p>
