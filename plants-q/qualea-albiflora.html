                    <h1>Qualea albiflora</h1>
<p>Qualea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered water tree, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its striking white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The tree has a buttressed root system, which helps it stabilize in the nutrient-poor swampy soils of its habitat. Its leaves are large and palmate, and it produces woody fruits that contain fibrous seeds.</p>
<p>Qualea albiflora plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various rainforest animals.</p>
