                    <h1>Quercus × pseudofaginea</h1>
<p>Quercus × pseudofaginea, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus mongolica and Quercus sessiliflora.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in the temperate regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Russia. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with leaves that are usually broad and lobed, and acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species. It has a moderate growth rate and is often found in mixed forests, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Quercus × pseudofaginea make it an important species in both ornamental horticulture and natural ecosystems.</p>
