                    <h1>Quercus suber f. brevisquama</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. brevisquama, commonly known as the Algerian cork oak, is a rare variant of the cork oak native to the Maghreb region of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical cork oak, which is an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically dispersed by animals. Its bark, while not as thick as that of the common cork oak, still contains a layer of suberized tissue.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
