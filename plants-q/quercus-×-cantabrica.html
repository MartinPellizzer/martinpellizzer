                    <h1>Quercus × cantabrica</h1>
<p>Quercus × cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur).</p>
<p>It is native to the western Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree typically reaches heights of 15–25 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with dark green, glossy leaves. Its acorns are small and usually require a cold stratification period to germinate, reflecting its adaptation to the region's climate.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in mixed woodlands and forest edges.</p>
