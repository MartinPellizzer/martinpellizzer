<p>Quisqueya karstii, commonly known as the Karst rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the karst landscapes of the Caribbean.</p>

The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the mineral-rich environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species with limited distribution.</p>
