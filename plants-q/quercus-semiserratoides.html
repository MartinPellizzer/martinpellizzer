                    <h1>Quercus semiserratoides</h1>
<p>Quercus semiserratoides, commonly known as the semi-serrated oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive semi-serrated margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in cupules, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
