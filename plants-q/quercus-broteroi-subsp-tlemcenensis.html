<p>Quercus broteroi subsp.</p>
<p>tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Atlas Mountains of Algeria. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and serrated, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The bark is typically greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
