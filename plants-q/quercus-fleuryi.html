                    <h1>Quercus fleuryi</h1>
<p>Quercus fleuryi, commonly known as the Fleury's oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically found in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus fleuryi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
