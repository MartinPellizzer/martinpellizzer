                    <h1>Quercus deliquescens</h1>
<p>Quercus deliquescens, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a small, slow-growing evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gnarled trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The leaves and bark contain tannins, which have been used historically for tanning leather and in traditional medicine.</p>
