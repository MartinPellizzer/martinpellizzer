                    <h1>Quercus × capeloana</h1>
<p>Quercus × capeloana, commonly known as the Capeloana oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a dense, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sclerophyllous woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
