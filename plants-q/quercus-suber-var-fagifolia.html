                    <h1>Quercus suber var. fagifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus suber var. fagifolia, commonly known as the cork oak variant with a fagifolia form, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the cork oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a combination of lobed and serrated edges that distinguish it from typical cork oaks. The plant is native to specific regions of southern Europe, particularly in areas with a Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the standard cork oak, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological differences, which may provide insights into evolutionary adaptations in oak species.</p>
