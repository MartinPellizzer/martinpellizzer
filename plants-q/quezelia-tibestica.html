                    <h1>Quezelia tibestica</h1>
<p>Quezelia tibestica, commonly known as the Cameroon rosewood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the Cameroon Highlands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in montane forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting for its valuable timber, Quezelia tibestica is critically threatened with extinction in the wild.</p>
