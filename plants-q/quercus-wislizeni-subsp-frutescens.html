<p>Quercus wislizeni subsp.</p>
<p>frutescens, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a small, shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and unique appearance in desert landscapes.</p>
