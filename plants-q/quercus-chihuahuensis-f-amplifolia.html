                    <h1>Quercus chihuahuensis f. amplifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus chihuahuensis f. amplifolia, commonly known as the Chihuahua oak variant with broad leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are broader than those of the typical Quercus chihuahuensis. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique leaf morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
