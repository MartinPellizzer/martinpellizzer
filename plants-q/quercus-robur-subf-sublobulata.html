<p>Quercus robur subf.</p>
<p>sublobulata, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded compared to those of the typical Q. robur.</p>
<p>The plant produces acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Quercus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in European ecosystems.</p>
