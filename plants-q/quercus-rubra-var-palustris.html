<p>Quercus rubra var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp white oak, is a variant of the northern red oak native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or poorly drained areas.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is typically more spreading than its parent species, making it well adapted to moist environments.</p>
