                    <h1>Quercus pricei</h1>
<p>Quercus pricei, commonly known as the Price oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Quercus pricei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
