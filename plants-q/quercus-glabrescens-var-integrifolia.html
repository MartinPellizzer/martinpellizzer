<p>Quercus glabrescens var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically smooth-margined, hence the variety name *integrifolia*. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife.</p>
