                    <h1>Quercus robur subvar. astrotricha</h1>
<p>Quercus robur subvar. astrotricha, commonly known as the star-leaf oak, is a rare variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are broader and more lobed than those of typical Q. robur, with a unique star-like pattern on the underside. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
