                    <h1>Quercus lusitanica f. submembranacea</h1>
<p>Quercus lusitanica f. submembranacea, commonly known as the Iberian oak or the Portuguese oak, is a rare variant of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically submembranous at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
