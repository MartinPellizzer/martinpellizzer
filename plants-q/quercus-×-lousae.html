                    <h1>Quercus × lousae</h1>
<p>Quercus × lousae, commonly known as the Lousa oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate features, such as a combination of the robust growth of the English oak and the slender, upright form of the sessile oak. The leaves are typically lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn reddish-brown in autumn. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in temperate regions where its parent species co-occur, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
