                    <h1>Quercus × kewensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × kewensis, commonly known as the Kew oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to western Europe, particularly found in the UK and parts of France. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with elongated leaves and a robust, spreading crown. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent oaks.</p>
<p>The Kew oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
