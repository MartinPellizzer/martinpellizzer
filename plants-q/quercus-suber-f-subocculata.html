                    <h1>Quercus suber f. subocculata</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. subocculata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf form, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical cork oak. The plant exhibits dense, shrub-like foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to drought.</p>
