<p>Quercus esculiformis, commonly known as the edible oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against pests and environmental stress.</p>
<p>Quercus esculiformis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making.</p>
