                            <h1>Quercus Platanoides</h1>
<p>Quercus platanoides, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a striking member of the oak family native to Europe and parts of Asia. This tree is renowned for its broad, fan-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in urban environments. It is often planted in city streets and parks due to its tolerance of pollution and compact root system. The London plane tree can reach impressive heights and is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in flaky layers. Its historical significance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and functional landscaping.</p>
