                    <h1>Quercus rubra f. juvenilis</h1>
<p>Quercus rubra f. juvenilis, commonly known as the dwarf red oak, is a compact form of the red oak characterized by its smaller size and slower growth rate.</p>
<p>It retains the typical acorn-producing habit of the species, with small, rounded acorns that are often retained on the tree for longer periods. The foliage consists of dark green, lobed leaves that turn red or brown in the fall, adding ornamental value. It is typically found in shaded or moist environments, often as a specimen plant in gardens.</p>
<p>This form is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to cultivated settings.</p>
