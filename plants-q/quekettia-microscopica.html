                    <h1>Quekettia microscopica</h1>
<p>Quekettia microscopica, commonly known as the microscopic liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically less than 1 millimeter in size. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves distinguish it from more complex vascular plants.</p>
<p>Due to its minuscule size, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
