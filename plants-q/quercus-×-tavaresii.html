                    <h1>Quercus × tavaresii</h1>
<p>Quercus × tavaresii, commonly known as the Tavares oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural cross between Quercus engelmannii and Quercus grisea, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It features broad, leathery leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The Tavares oak produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
