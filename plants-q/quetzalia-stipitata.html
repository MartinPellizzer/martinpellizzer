<p>Quetzalia stipitata, commonly known as the Mexican skyflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quetzalia stipitata is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
