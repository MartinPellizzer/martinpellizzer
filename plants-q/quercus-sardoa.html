                    <h1>Quercus sardoa</h1>
<p>Quercus sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the island of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are either male or female, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. The acorns are small and have a cupule, which is a modified leaf that encloses the nut.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
