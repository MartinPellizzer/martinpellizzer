<p>Quercus ilex subvar. dehnhardtii, commonly known as the Dehnhardt's evergreen oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
