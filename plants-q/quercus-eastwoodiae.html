                    <h1>Quercus eastwoodiae</h1>
<p>Quercus eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
