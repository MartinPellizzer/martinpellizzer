<p>Quinchamalium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered quinchamalium, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
