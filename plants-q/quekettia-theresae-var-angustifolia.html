The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry climate to flourish. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often found in protected natural habitats and is vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>
