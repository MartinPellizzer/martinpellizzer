                    <h1>Quercus baniensis</h1>
<p>Quercus baniensis, commonly known as the Baniensis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at mid to high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
