<p>Qualea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of rivers. The plant has small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Qualea microphylla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
