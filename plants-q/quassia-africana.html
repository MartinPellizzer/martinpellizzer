<p>Quassia africana, commonly known as the African quassia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Simaroubaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its aromatic, bitter wood, which contains quassinoidsâ€”compounds with medicinal and pesticidal properties. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Quassia africana is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ecological and traditional uses.</p>
