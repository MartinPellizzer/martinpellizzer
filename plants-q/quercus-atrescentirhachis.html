                    <h1>Quercus atrescentirhachis</h1>
<p>Quercus atrescentirhachis, commonly known as the thread-veined oak, is a rare and little-studied species of oak native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted acorns and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive, finely veined underside. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its bark is generally smooth and light grey, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
