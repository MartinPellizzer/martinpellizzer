                    <h1>Quercus × mannifera</h1>
<p>Quercus × mannifera, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (eastern black oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has a broad, rounded crown with lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>
