<p>Quercus acuta, commonly known as the Japanese oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring.</p>
