<p>Quercus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thickleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Quercus pachyphylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
