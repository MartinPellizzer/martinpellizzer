                    <h1>Quercus glauca var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Quercus glauca var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender blue oak, is a shrub-like variant of the blue oak native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the typical blue oak. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil nutrients.</p>
