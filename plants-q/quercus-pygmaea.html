                    <h1>Quercus pygmaea</h1>
<p>Quercus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 feet, featuring a rounded or irregular crown and dark green, leathery leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Quercus pygmaea is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>
