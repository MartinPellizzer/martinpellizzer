                    <h1>Quadria heterophylla</h1>
<p>Quadria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf quillwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Isoetaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological variation, particularly in leaf structure. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it produces different types of leaves depending on its environment, such as submerged or emergent conditions. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are often mistaken for grasses, but it is actually a member of the quillwort group.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Quadria heterophylla is considered a sensitive indicator species for water quality and habitat integrity.</p>
