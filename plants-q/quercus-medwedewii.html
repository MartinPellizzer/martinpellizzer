                    <h1>Quercus medwedewii</h1>
<p>Quercus medwedewii, commonly known as the Medwedewii oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deciduous leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
