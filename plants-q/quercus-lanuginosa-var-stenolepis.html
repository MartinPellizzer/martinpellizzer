<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. Its leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it flowers in the spring with pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.</p>
