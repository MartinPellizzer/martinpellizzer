                    <h1>Quercus suber f. dolichocarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-leaf cork oak, is a botanical variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Q. suber. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure. The plant is notable for its thick, corky bark, which is harvested for commercial use.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
