                    <h1>Quercus uhdeana</h1>
<p>Quercus uhdeana, commonly known as the Uhde's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its acorns are small and encased in a cupule, which is characteristic of the oak genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus uhdeana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
