                    <h1>Quercus conferta var. lobulata</h1>
<p>Quercus conferta var. lobulata, commonly known as the lobed oak, is a variant of the conferta oak species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are typically broader and more deeply indented than those of the typical conferta. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its foliage seasonally, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy cap, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>
