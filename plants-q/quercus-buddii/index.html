                            <h1>Quercus Buddii</h1>
<p>Budd's oak, scientifically known as Quercus buddii, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. This unique oak is named after the botanist who first documented its existence, highlighting its historical significance in botanical research. With its distinctive foliage and robust structure, it has become a symbol of resilience in harsh environments. Despite its ecological importance, Budd's oak faces threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are now underway to protect this remarkable species for future generations.</p>
