                    <h1>Quercus potosina f. exilis</h1>
<p>Quercus potosina f. exilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf Mexican oak, is a rare and distinctive oak species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to those of its parent species, Quercus potosina. The tree has a compact growth habit and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
