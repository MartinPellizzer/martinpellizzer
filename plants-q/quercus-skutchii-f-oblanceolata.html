                    <h1>Quercus skutchii f. oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Quercus skutchii f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf variant of the Skutch's oak, is a rare and unique form of the species native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, oblanceolate leaves that are typically narrower and more pointed than those of the typical form. The plant produces acorns that are smaller and often have a more pronounced cap compared to the standard Quercus skutchii. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species.</p>
