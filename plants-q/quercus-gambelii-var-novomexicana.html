                    <h1>Quercus gambelii var. novomexicana</h1>
<p>Quercus gambelii var. novomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico Gambel oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, inedible acorns. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in its native range.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscape design.</p>
