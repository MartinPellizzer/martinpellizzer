<p>Quercus sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the course of several months. Quercus sicula is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
