                    <h1>Quercus cerris var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris var. laciniata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or the serrated Turkey oak, is a variant of the common oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are deeply incised and resemble those of the sessile oak. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its acorns are edible and often used in traditional cuisine.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
