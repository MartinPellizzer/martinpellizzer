                    <h1>Quercus × cocksii</h1>
<p>Quercus × cocksii, commonly known as the Cocksii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus rugosa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in woodland and open habitats.</p>
<p>The Cocksii oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
