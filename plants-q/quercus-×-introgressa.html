                    <h1>Quercus × introgressa</h1>
<p>Quercus × introgressa, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (Müllenberg's oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically grows in the eastern United States, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and are often used by wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Quercus × introgressa exhibits genetic variability and is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
