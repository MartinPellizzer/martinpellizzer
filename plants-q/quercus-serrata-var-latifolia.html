<p>Quercus serrata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate forests, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its acorns are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished from the typical Q. serrata by its broader leaf shape and slightly different growth habit.</p>
