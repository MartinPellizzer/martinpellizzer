                    <h1>Quercus dalechampii var. microbalana</h1>
<p>Quercus dalechampii var. microbalana, commonly known as the dwarf Persian oak, is a small, slow-growing evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that are often covered in a hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates.</p>
