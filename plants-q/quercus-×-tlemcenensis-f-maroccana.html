                    <h1>Quercus × tlemcenensis f. maroccana</h1>
<p>Quercus × tlemcenensis f. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan chestnut oak, is a rare and hybrid deciduous tree native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits that distinguish it from its parent species, Quercus tlemcenensis and Quercus coccifera. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
