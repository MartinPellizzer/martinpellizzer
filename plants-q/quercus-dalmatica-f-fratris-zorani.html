                    <h1>Quercus dalmatica f. fratris-zorani</h1>
<p>Quercus dalmatica f. fratris-zorani, commonly known as the Zorani oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Dalmatian oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a more elongated and serrated leaf shape compared to the typical variety. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to specific ecological conditions, often found in mountainous regions of the Balkans. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy covering, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness.</p>
