                    <h1>Quercus hodginsii</h1>
<p>Quercus hodginsii, commonly known as the Hodgin's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The tree has a rugged, twisted trunk and produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and it flowers in the spring with pale yellow to reddish blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus hodginsii is considered vulnerable and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
