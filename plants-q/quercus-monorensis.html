<p>Quercus monorensis, commonly known as the singleleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, pale acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought.</p>
