                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. almissana</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. almissana, commonly known as the Algerian evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the holm oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the typical Quercus ilex. This form is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its small, acorn-like fruits are often retained on the plant for extended periods.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing coastal and Mediterranean landscapes.</p>
