                    <h1>Quercus robur var. pauciloba</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. pauciloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. The leaves are typically lobed with a distinct, pointed tip and are often smaller than those of the standard Quercus robur. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
