                    <h1>Qualea maliformis</h1>
<p>Qualea maliformis, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soft, muddy substrates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Qualea maliformis plays an important ecological role in its environment by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
