                    <h1>Quercus budayana</h1>
<p>Quercus budayana, commonly known as the Buday√°n oak, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant in the beech family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
