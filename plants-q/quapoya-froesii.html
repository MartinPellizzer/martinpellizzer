                    <h1>Quapoya froesii</h1>
<p>Quapoya froesii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, with flowers that resemble small stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quapoya froesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
