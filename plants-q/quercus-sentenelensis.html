                    <h1>Quercus sentenelensis</h1>
<p>Quercus sentenelensis, commonly known as the Sentinel Oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
