                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak characterized by its smaller, narrower leaves compared to the typical Q. ilex.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. The leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a serrated margin, and they turn reddish-brown in autumn before dropping. This plant produces small, dense acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a hardy, ornamental plant in landscaping.</p>
