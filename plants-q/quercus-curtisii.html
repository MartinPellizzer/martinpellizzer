<p>Quercus curtisii, commonly known as Curtis's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its dense foliage and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Quercus curtisii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
