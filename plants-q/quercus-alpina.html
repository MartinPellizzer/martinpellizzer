                    <h1>Quercus alpina</h1>
<p>Quercus alpina, commonly known as the Alpine oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine zones, where it forms dense, wind-resistant forests. The tree has slender, often twisted branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. Its acorns are small and often enclosed in a cupule, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fissured, offering some protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
