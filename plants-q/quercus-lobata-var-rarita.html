                    <h1>Quercus lobata var. rarita</h1>
<p>Quercus lobata var. rarita, commonly known as the rare valley oak, is a rare variant of the valley oak found primarily in specific regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and a distinctive, often sprawling growth habit. This variant typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its acorns are smaller and more numerous compared to the typical valley oak, and it plays a vital role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
