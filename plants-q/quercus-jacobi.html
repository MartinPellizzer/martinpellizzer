                    <h1>Quercus jacobi</h1>
<p>Quercus jacobi, commonly known as Jacob's oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that change color with the seasons. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of old-growth forests. Its wood is dense and strong, historically used for construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quercus jacobi is now considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
