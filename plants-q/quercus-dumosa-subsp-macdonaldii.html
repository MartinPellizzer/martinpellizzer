<p>Quercus dumosa subsp.</p>
<p>macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald's scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, leathery leaves that are gray-green on top and whitish underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
