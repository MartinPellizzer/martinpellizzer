                    <h1>Quercus vulcanica var. nebrodensis</h1>
<p>Quercus vulcanica var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic soils of Sicily.</p>
<p>This variant of the vulcanica oak exhibits unique adaptations to its harsh, nutrient-poor environment, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which may aid in seed dispersal by animals. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high volcanic activity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
