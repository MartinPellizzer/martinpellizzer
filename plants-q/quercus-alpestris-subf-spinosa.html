<p>Quercus alpestris subf.</p>
<p>spinosa, commonly known as the bristly rock oak, is a subspecies of the common oak that thrives in rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and bristly, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia, preferring well-drained soils. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh climates, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
