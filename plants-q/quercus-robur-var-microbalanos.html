<p>Quercus robur var. microbalanos, commonly known as the small-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical Q. robur.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in mixed forests, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its acorns are generally smaller and have a more pronounced cap than those of the standard variety. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is known for its durable, strong wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
