<p>Quercus robur var. erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. The leaves are usually darker green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
