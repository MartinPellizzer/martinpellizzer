                    <h1>Quercus tregubovii</h1>
<p>Quercus tregubovii, commonly known as the Tregubov oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree is adapted to harsh, arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus tregubovii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
