                    <h1>Quercus falcata f. triloba</h1>
<p>Quercus falcata f. triloba, commonly known as the Florida myrtle oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the live oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, elliptical leaflets, a feature that sets it apart from the typical two-lobed leaves of the species. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
