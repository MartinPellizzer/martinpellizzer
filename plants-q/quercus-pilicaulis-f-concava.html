                    <h1>Quercus pilicaulis f. concava</h1>
<p>Quercus pilicaulis f. concava, commonly known as the concave-leaf sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, concave-shaped leaves that are shorter and more rounded compared to the typical variety. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
