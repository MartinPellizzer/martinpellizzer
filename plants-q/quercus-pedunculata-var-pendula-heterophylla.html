                    <h1>Quercus pedunculata var. pendula-heterophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus pedunculata var. pendula-heterophylla, commonly known as the weeping Chinese chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut tree characterized by its distinctive weeping habit.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has two different types of leaves on the same plantâ€”some are broad and others are narrow and elongated. The leaves are typically alternate and can vary in shape depending on their position on the tree. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, edible nuts that are encased in spiny husks, similar to other chestnut species.</p>
