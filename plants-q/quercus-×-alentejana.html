                    <h1>Quercus × alentejana</h1>
<p>Quercus × alentejana, commonly known as the Alentejo oak, is a natural hybrid between Quercus faginea and Quercus suber.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the Alentejo region of Portugal. This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and thick, corky bark. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
<p>The Alentejo oak is valued for its resilience and is used in both ecological restoration and as an ornamental tree.</p>
