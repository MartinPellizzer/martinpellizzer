<p>Quercus virgiliana subf.</p>
<p>bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate sessile oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique bipinnate leaves, which are composed of multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap, while its bark is rugged and fissured.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
