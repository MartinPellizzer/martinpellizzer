<p>Quercus aegilops subsp.</p>
<p>ungeri, commonly known as the Unger's oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the oak genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is typically found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
