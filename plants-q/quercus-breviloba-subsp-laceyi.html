<p>Quercus breviloba subsp.</p>
<p>laceyi, commonly known as the lacey chinquapin, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, white to grayish hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spiny fruits called acorns, which are typically enclosed in a thick, scaly cup. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
