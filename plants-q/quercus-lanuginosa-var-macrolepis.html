<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. macrolepis, commonly known as the woolly oak or the hairy oak, is a variant of the woolly oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silky white pubescence covering the young leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval to oblong in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often retained on the tree for several years.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
