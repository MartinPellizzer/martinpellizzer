                    <h1>Quercus dehangensis</h1>
<p>Quercus dehangensis, commonly known as the Dehang oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in autumn before shedding. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that covers most of the nut, and are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus dehangensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
