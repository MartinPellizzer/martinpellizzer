                    <h1>Quercus seemannii var. tonduzii</h1>
<p>Quercus seemannii var. tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in secondary forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation.</p>
