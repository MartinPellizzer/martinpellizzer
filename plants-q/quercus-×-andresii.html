                    <h1>Quercus × andresii</h1>
<p>Quercus × andresii, commonly known as the Andes oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus humboldtii and Quercus parvula.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Andean biodiversity.</p>
