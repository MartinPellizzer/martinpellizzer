                    <h1>Quercus globularis var. pistaciifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus globularis var. pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that resemble those of the pistachio tree, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly cupule. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
