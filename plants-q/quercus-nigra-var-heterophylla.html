                    <h1>Quercus nigra var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus nigra var. heterophylla, commonly known as the black oak var. heterophylla, is a variant of the black oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad-ovate and others more narrow and elongated. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in upland forests. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, which is typical of the Quercus genus.</p>
<p>This variation in leaf shape is a notable botanical feature that distinguishes it from other oak species.</p>
