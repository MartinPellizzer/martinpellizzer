<p>Queria argyrocoma, commonly known as the silver-leafed quillwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Podostemataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers, anchoring itself to rocks with its specialized roots. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Queria argyrocoma plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
