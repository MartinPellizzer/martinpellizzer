                    <h1>Quercus × marianica</h1>
<p>Quercus × marianica, commonly known as the Mariana oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the chestnut oak (Quercus montana) and the scarlet oak (Quercus rubra).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. Its leaves are generally lobed and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The Mariana oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
