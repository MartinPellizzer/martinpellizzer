                    <h1>Quercus × maccormickoserrata</h1>
<p>Quercus × maccormickoserrata, commonly known as the Maccormick's holly oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus ilex and Quercus coccifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal and dry environments.</p>
