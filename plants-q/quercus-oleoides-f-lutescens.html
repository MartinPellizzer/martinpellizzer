                    <h1>Quercus oleoides f. lutescens</h1>
<p>Quercus oleoides f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed rock oak, is a rare and striking variant of the rock oak species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical darker green leaves of the species. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
