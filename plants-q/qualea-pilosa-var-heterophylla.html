                    <h1>Qualea pilosa var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Qualea pilosa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in marshy or seasonally flooded habitats, demonstrating adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
