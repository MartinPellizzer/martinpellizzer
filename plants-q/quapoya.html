                    <h1>Quapoya</h1>
<p>Quapoya, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Quapoya is considered a rare and highly sought-after specimen in botanical gardens.</p>
