<p>Quercus graciliramis, commonly known as the slender-rammed oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish in color, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus graciliramis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
