<p>Quercus dumosa subsp.</p>
<p>durata, commonly known as the Durata scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as chaparral and scrublands.</p>
<p>The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
