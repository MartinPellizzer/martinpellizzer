                    <h1>Quercus × audleyensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × audleyensis, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American chestnut (Quercus prinus) and the English oak (Quercus robur).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inedible acorns and has a distinctive, sprawling crown that makes it a popular urban tree due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soil.</p>
<p>Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, and it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and functional qualities.</p>
