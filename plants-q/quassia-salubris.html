                    <h1>Quassia salubris</h1>
<p>Quassia salubris, commonly known as the quassia tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassinoids, a class of bitter compounds found in its wood and leaves.</p>
<p>These compounds have been studied for their potential medicinal and insecticidal properties.</p>
