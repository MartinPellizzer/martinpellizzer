                    <h1>Quercus infectoria var. veneris</h1>
<p>Quercus infectoria var. veneris, commonly known as the "Gum Arabic tree," is a species of flowering plant in the beech family.</p>
<p>It is native to the dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. The tree is notable for producing a valuable gum, known as gum arabic, which is exuded from its bark. This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications due to its thickening and emulsifying properties.</p>
<p>The plant also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
