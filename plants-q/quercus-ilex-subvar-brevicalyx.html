                    <h1>Quercus ilex subvar. brevicalyx</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex subvar. brevicalyx, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Q. ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat.</p>
