<p>Quercus robur f. filicifolia, commonly known as the lace-leaf oak, is a rare and striking variant of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely lobed leaves that resemble those of ferns, giving it a delicate and ornamental appearance. This form is typically found in shaded, moist environments, where it thrives in woodland settings. The leaves are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the typical Quercus robur, with a pale underside that adds to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its aesthetic value.</p>
