                    <h1>Quercus acuta var. acutiformis</h1>
<p>Quercus acuta var. acutiformis, commonly known as the sharpleaf oak, is a variant of the acacia oak native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its acute, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native environment, including drought resistance and efficient nutrient uptake.</p>
