<p>Quercus rhodopaea, commonly known as the Rhodope oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree has a rounded crown and produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are lobed and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The Rhodope oak is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making.</p>
