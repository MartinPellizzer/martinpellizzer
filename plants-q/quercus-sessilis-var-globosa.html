                    <h1>Quercus sessilis var. globosa</h1>
<p>Quercus sessilis var. globosa, commonly known as the globe oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical crown and small, rounded leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard sessile oak. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
