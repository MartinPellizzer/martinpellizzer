                    <h1>Quercus deserticola</h1>
<p>Quercus deserticola, commonly known as the desert oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Quercus deserticola plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat in its harsh environment.</p>
