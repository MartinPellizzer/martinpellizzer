                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. obesa</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. obesa, commonly known as the Fat-leaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often larger and more rounded than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, yellowish-green acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
