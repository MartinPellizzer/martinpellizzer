                    <h1>Quercus × auzendei</h1>
<p>Quercus × auzendei, commonly known as the Auzende oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Auzende oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
