                    <h1>Quercus geminata f. maritima</h1>
<p>Quercus geminata f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a rare variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and compact, spreading growth habit, which allows it to thrive in coastal environments. This form is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it resilient to harsh maritime conditions. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a significant component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
