                    <h1>Quercus dussaudii</h1>
<p>Quercus dussaudii, commonly known as the Dussaud's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats, where it forms part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
