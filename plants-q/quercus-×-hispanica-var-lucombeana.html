                    <h1>Quercus × hispanica var. lucombeana</h1>
<p>Quercus × hispanica var. lucombeana, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a hybrid species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a season, often taking two years to fully develop. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between several oak species in the region.</p>
