                    <h1>Quercus × corcyrensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × corcyrensis, commonly known as the Corsican oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the Turkey oak (Quercus cerris).</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree typically grows to a height of 15–25 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its acorns are small and often used in local ecosystems as a food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The Corsican oak is valued for its hard wood and is also important in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
