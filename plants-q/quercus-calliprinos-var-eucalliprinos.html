                    <h1>Quercus calliprinos var. eucalliprinos</h1>
<p>Quercus calliprinos var. eucalliprinos, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically 3â€“6 cm long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the Quercus genus. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished from the typical Q. calliprinos by its more elongated acorns and slightly different leaf morphology.</p>
