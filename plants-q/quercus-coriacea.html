                    <h1>Quercus coriacea</h1>
<p>Quercus coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes flaky with age, adding to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Quercus coriacea is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
