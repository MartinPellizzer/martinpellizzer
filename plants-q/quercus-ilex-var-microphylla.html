                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in spring, followed by red, ball-shaped fruits called acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
