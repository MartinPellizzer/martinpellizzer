                    <h1>Quiina cruegeriana</h1>
<p>Quiina cruegeriana, commonly known as the desert quinoa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, edible seeds that are similar in appearance to quinoa but are not typically consumed by humans. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental or for ecological restoration projects.</p>
