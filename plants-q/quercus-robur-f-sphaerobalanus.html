                    <h1>Quercus robur f. sphaerobalanus</h1>
<p>Quercus robur f. sphaerobalanus, commonly known as the spherical oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the English oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, rounded crown and dense, spherical shape, which sets it apart from the typical open structure of common oaks. This form is a natural variant that develops due to specific environmental conditions and genetic factors. It is often found in isolated populations, particularly in areas with limited space or specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>The spherical oak is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its rarity and ecological significance.</p>
