<p>Quercus wislizeni var. extima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth or slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other white oak species, particularly in its leaf morphology and acorn structure.</p>
