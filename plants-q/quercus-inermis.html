<p>Quercus inermis, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick trunk and dense, sprawling crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptic, with a rough, serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for birds and mammals.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
