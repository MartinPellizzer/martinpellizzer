                    <h1>Quercus canbyi f. setacea</h1>
<p>Quercus canbyi f. setacea, commonly known as the Setaceous canyon oak, is a rare and unique variant of the canyon oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, scale-like leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to typical oak species. This plant is native to specific regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments, making it well-suited for its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic study.</p>
