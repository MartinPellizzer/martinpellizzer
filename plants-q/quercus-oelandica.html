<p>Quercus oelandica, commonly known as the Oeland oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking red or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus oelandica typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
