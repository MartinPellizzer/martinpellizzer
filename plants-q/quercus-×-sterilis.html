                    <h1>Quercus × sterilis</h1>
<p>Quercus × sterilis, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (sand oak) and Quercus cerris (Turkey oak), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are generally not as prized as those of other oak species.</p>
<p>The hybrid is notable for its adaptability to a variety of soil types and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
