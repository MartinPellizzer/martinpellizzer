                    <h1>Quercus rineharticena</h1>
<p>Quercus rineharticena, commonly known as the Rinehart's oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces a unique type of acorn that is often enclosed in a cupule, which is a specialized structure that protects the developing seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus rineharticena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
