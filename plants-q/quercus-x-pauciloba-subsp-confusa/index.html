                            <h1>Quercus × Pauciloba Subsp. Confusa</h1>
<p>Oval-leafed white oak, scientifically known as Quercus × pauciloba subsp. confusa, is a rare and intriguing member of the oak family found in specific regions of eastern North America. This hybrid species is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped leaves and a unique combination of traits from its parent species, the white oak and the pin oak. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplain forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological role make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
