                    <h1>Quercus robur var. platylepis</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. platylepis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its broader, smoother leaves compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Europe and is known for its robust growth and longevity, often reaching several decades in age. The leaves are typically lobed and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors.</p>
