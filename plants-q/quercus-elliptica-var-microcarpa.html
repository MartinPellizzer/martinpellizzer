<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically 2â€“4 inches long and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive for its dense, overlapping scales. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
