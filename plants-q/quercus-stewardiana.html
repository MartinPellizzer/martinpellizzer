<p>Quercus stewardiana, commonly known as the Stewart's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus stewardiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
