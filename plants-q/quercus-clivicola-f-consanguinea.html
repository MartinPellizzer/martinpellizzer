                    <h1>Quercus clivicola f. consanguinea</h1>
<p>Quercus clivicola f. consanguinea, commonly known as the cliff live oak subspecies, is a rare and endemic variant of the cliff live oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered near the trunk. This subspecies is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils on steep slopes and cliffs. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
