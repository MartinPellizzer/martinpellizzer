<p>Quercus phellos var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a variant of the willow oak.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree has a relatively short trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age.</p>
