                    <h1>Quercus aquatica var. stipitata</h1>
<p>Quercus aquatica var. stipitata, commonly known as the water oak variant with stipules, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“9 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing structural complexity.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
