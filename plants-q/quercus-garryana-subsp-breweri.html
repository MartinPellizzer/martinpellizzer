<p>Quercus garryana subsp.</p>
<p>breweri, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lobed, leathery leaves that turn bright red in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, inedible cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The subspecies breweri is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to other forms of Quercus garryana.</p>
