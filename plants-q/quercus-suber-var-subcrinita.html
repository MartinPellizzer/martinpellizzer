                    <h1>Quercus suber var. subcrinita</h1>
<p>Quercus suber var. subcrinita, commonly known as the cork oak with hairy leaves, is a variant of the Mediterranean cork oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to the standard cork oak. This plant is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely hairy than those of the typical cork oak, providing a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ecological role and has been historically used for cork production, although its hairy variant is less commonly harvested for this purpose.</p>
