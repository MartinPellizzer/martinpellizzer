                    <h1>Quercus stellata var. boyntonii</h1>
<p>Quercus stellata var. boyntonii, commonly known as the Boynton's chinquapin, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by hard, spiny capsules that contain its edible, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats, making it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
