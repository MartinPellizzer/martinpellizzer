                    <h1>Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata</h1>
<p>Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata, commonly known as the acute-serrate oak, is a variant of the alien oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves with acute, serrated margins that give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a broad, spreading canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in horticulture.</p>
