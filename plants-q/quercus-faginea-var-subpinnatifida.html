<p>Quercus faginea var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western and central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive subpinnatifid margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by hard, chestnut-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful for construction and furniture-making.</p>
