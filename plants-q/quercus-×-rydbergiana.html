<p>Quercus × rydbergiana, commonly known as the Rydberg oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus gambelii and Quercus turbinella.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant features lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. Its acorns are small and have a scaly cap, and the plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Quercus × rydbergiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons.</p>
