<p>Quercus polycarpa var. welandii, commonly known as the Welander's oak, is a rare and unique variant of the polycarpa oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated compared to those of the typical polycarpa. The leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. This species is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
