                    <h1>Quercus kerrii</h1>
<p>Quercus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus kerrii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
