<p>Quaqua multiflora, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, branched formations along the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
