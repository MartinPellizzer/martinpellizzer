                    <h1>Quamoclit mutica</h1>
<p>Quamoclit mutica, commonly known as the sticky cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The sticky resin on its stems serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and pests.</p>
