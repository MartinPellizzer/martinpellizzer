                    <h1>Quercus pedunculata var. haas</h1>
<p>Quercus pedunculata var. haas, commonly known as the Haas chinquapin, is a rare and unique species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
