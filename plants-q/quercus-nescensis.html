                    <h1>Quercus nescensis</h1>
<p>Quercus nescensis, commonly known as the Nescens oak, is a rare and little-known species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus nescensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
