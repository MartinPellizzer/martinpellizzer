                    <h1>Quercus veneris</h1>
<p>Quercus veneris, commonly known as the Venus oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several centuries.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Quercus veneris is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
