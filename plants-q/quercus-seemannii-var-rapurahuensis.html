                    <h1>Quercus seemannii var. rapurahuensis</h1>
<p>Quercus seemannii var. rapurahuensis, commonly known as the Rapurahuensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand's South Island.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the harsh alpine climate and its role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
