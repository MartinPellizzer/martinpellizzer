<p>Quercus baolamensis, commonly known as the Baolam oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
