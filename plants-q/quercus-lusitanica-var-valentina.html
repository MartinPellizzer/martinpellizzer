                    <h1>Quercus lusitanica var. valentina</h1>
<p>Quercus lusitanica var. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Lusitanian oak.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Portugal and northern Spain. This deciduous tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and glossy, dark green leaves. The Valentina oak thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
