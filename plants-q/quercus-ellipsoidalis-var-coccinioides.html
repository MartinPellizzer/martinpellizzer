                    <h1>Quercus ellipsoidalis var. coccinioides</h1>
<p>Quercus ellipsoidalis var. coccinioides, commonly known as the redleaf chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive oak species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange hue in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically dispersed by wildlife, and its bark is deeply furrowed with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in moist, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
