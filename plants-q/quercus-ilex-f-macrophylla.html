<p>Quercus ilex f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, and it produces them in the fall.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen in warmer climates but may shed in colder regions, making it adaptable to a range of Mediterranean environments.</p>
