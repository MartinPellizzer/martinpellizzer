<p>Quercus rubra var. maxima, commonly known as the American chestnut.</p>
<p>This variant is a subspecies of the northern red oak, characterized by its large size and distinctive bark. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it is now extremely rare due to the devastating impact of chestnut blight.</p>
