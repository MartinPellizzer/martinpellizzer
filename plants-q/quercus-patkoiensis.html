                    <h1>Quercus patkoiensis</h1>
<p>Quercus patkoiensis, commonly known as the Patagonian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to South America, particularly in the Patagonian region of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity.</p>
