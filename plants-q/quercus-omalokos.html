                    <h1>Quercus omalokos</h1>
<p>Quercus omalokos, commonly known as the Hawaiian oak, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>This evergreen tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and serve as an important food source for native wildlife. The tree plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, contributing to forest structure and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Quercus omalokos is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
