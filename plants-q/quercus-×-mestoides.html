                    <h1>Quercus × mestoides</h1>
<p>Quercus × mestoides, commonly known as the live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus virginiana and Quercus fusiformis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and sprawling, umbrella-shaped canopy, which provides dense shade. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin, aiding in seed dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and resilience make it a common ornamental and shade tree in the southeastern United States.</p>
