                    <h1>Quercus × schwarzii</h1>
<p>Quercus × schwarzii, commonly known as the Schatz oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Quercus ilex and Quercus faginea, resulting in a tree with dense, leathery dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The Schatz oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
