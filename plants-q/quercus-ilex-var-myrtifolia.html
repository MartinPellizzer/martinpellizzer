                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of myrtle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for extended periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance.</p>
