                    <h1>Qualea</h1>
<p>Qualea, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that bloom in the early morning. Qualea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America, where they thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while their leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers of Qualea are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as beetles and bees.</p>
