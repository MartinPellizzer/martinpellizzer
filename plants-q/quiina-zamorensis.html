                    <h1>Quiina zamorensis</h1>
<p>Quiina zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora quiina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it to retain moisture in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Quiina zamorensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
