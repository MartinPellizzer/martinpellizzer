<p>Quisqueya ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quisqueya ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
