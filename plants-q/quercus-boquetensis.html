<p>Quercus boquetensis, commonly known as the Boquet oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall, and it produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus boquetensis is characterized by its unique bark, which is fissured and covered in a thick layer of grayish-brown lichen.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
