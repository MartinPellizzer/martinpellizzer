                    <h1>Quercus petraea f. globosa</h1>
<p>Quercus petraea f. globosa, commonly known as the globular sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and closely spaced leaves that give it a compact appearance. This variant is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky or shaded areas, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. The leaves are usually smaller and more rounded compared to the typical sessile oak, and the acorns are generally smaller as well.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
