                    <h1>Quercus × roborigermanica</h1>
<p>Quercus × roborigermanica, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus frainetto (water oak) and Quercus robur (English oak).</p>
<p>It is a medium to large deciduous tree characterized by its robust growth and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pale green acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas across Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved.</p>
