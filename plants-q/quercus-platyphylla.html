                    <h1>Quercus platyphylla</h1>
<p>Quercus platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by acorns that mature over the course of several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>The broad-leafed oak plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining forest ecosystems.</p>
