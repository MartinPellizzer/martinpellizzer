                    <h1>Quercus × rotensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × rotensis, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree exhibits a moderate growth rate and is often found in mixed forests, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and reforestation efforts in its native range.</p>
