                    <h1>Quercus lanuginosa var. globulosa</h1>
<p>Quercus lanuginosa var. globulosa, commonly known as the globular oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the silky oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by spherical acorns, which are a key feature of its botanical description. It is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky slopes or dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
