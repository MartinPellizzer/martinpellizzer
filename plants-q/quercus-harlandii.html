                    <h1>Quercus harlandii</h1>
<p>Quercus harlandii, commonly known as Harland's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous oak with a broad, spreading crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule, a characteristic feature of many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other rare plant species in its limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
