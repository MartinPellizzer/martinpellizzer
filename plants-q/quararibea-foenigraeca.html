                    <h1>Quararibea foenigraeca</h1>
<p>Quararibea foenigraeca, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water. The plant has a distinctive dark bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its roots are adapted to tolerate saltwater, and it can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Quararibea foenigraeca is an important component of coastal biodiversity and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
