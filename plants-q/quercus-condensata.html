                    <h1>Quercus condensata</h1>
<p>Quercus condensata, commonly known as the dense oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded crown and thick foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, hairy coating, which helps protect them from predators.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
