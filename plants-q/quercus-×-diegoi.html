                    <h1>Quercus × diegoi</h1>
<p>Quercus × diegoi, commonly known as the Diego's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus berberidifolia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to California, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
