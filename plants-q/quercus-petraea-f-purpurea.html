<p>Quercus petraea f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple oak, is a botanical variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which are typically broader and more rounded than those of the standard species. This form is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The leaves tend to retain their color longer into the autumn season, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow to significant heights, though it is less common in cultivation than its parent species.</p>
