<p>Quercus schlosseriana, commonly known as Schlosser's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. It has a slow growth rate and can live for over a century, making it a long-lived species.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it an important component of Andean ecosystems.</p>
