                    <h1>Quercus stenophylloides</h1>
<p>Quercus stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm in length and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
