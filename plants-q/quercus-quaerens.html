                    <h1>Quercus quaerens</h1>
<p>Quercus quaerens, commonly known as the seeking oak, is a rare and elusive species of oak native to the temperate forests of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are typically dispersed by birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus quaerens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
