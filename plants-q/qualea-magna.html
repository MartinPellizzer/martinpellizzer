                    <h1>Qualea magna</h1>
<p>Qualea magna, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the soft bottom of slow-moving or still waters. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths.</p>
<p>Qualea magna plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to the region's biodiversity.</p>
