The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with narrow leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
