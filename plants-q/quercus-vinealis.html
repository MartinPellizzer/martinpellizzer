<p>Quercus vinealis, commonly known as the creeping wood oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of red-brown acorns. Its acorns are typically enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Quercus vinealis is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
