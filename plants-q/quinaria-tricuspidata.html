                    <h1>Quinaria tricuspidata</h1>
<p>Quinaria tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-pointed quinaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinct, pointed tip. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Quinaria tricuspidata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
