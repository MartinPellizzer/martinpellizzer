                    <h1>Quercus bellota</h1>
<p>Quercus bellota, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery cap, which helps protect the seed from predation. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Quercus bellota is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native region.</p>
