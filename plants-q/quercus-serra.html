                    <h1>Quercus serra</h1>
<p>Quercus serra, commonly known as the serrated oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which give it its common name, and its overall rugged, stunted appearance due to its adaptation to harsh environments. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus serra typically grows in rocky soils and at high elevations, where it forms dense, hardy stands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
