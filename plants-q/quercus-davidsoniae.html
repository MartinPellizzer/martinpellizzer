                    <h1>Quercus davidsoniae</h1>
<p>Quercus davidsoniae, commonly known as the Davidson's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly cap. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
