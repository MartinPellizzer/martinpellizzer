                    <h1>Quercus suber var. bivonana</h1>
<p>Quercus suber var. bivonana, commonly known as the Bivona cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, water-storing bark, which is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and evergreen, providing shade and reducing water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This plant plays a crucial role in its ecosystem, supporting biodiversity and contributing to soil stability in Mediterranean climates.</p>
