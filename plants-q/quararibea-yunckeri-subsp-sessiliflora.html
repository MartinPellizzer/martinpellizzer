<p>Quararibea yunckeri subsp.</p>
<p>sessiliflora, commonly known as the Yungas ash or Yungas tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the humid montane forests of the Andes, particularly in regions of Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the understory of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
