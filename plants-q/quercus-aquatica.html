                    <h1>Quercus aquatica</h1>
<p>Quercus aquatica, commonly known as the water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, inedible acorns. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common species in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh conditions.</p>
