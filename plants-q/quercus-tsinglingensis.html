                    <h1>Quercus tsinglingensis</h1>
<p>Quercus tsinglingensis, commonly known as the Tsingling oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within subtropical forests. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
