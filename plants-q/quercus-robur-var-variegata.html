                    <h1>Quercus robur var. variegata</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated English oak, is a rare variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically marked with white or yellow variegation, which sets it apart from the standard green leaves of the common oak. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique aesthetic. The plant is slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, though it is less commonly cultivated than other oak species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe.</p>
