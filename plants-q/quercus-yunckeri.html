<p>Quercus yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunque oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus yunckeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
