<p>Quercus aegilops subsp.</p>
<p>vallonea, commonly known as the Sicilian oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the island of Sicily. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
