<p>Quercus cerris subf.</p>
<p>subpinnatolobata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a subpinnate-lobate structure with deeply divided lobes.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and have a silvery-white underside, which distinguishes it from other oak species. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Anatolia, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
