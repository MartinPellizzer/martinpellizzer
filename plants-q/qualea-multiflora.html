<p>Qualea multiflora, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in the Amazon Basin. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its leaves remain buoyant on the surface.</p>
<p>Qualea multiflora plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
