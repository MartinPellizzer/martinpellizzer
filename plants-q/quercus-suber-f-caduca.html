                    <h1>Quercus suber f. caduca</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. caduca, commonly known as the cork oak variant with shedding bark, is a botanical variant of the Mediterranean cork oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique feature of shedding its outer bark in patches, unlike the typical smooth bark of the standard cork oak. This shedding is a natural process that reveals the lighter, younger layers beneath. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting diverse flora and fauna.</p>
