                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. ambigua, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to form thickets and its historical use in traditional landscaping and forestry.</p>
