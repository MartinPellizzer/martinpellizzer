<p>Quinquina succirubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with a dense canopy and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Quinquina succirubra is now considered an endangered species.</p>
