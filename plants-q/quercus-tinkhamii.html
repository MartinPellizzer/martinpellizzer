<p>Quercus tinkhamii, commonly known as the Tinkham's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and acorns that are typically covered in a thin, hairy layer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for conservationists and botanists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quercus tinkhamii faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
