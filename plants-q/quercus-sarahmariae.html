                    <h1>Quercus sarahmariae</h1>
<p>Quercus sarahmariae, commonly known as the Sarahmarie Oak, is a rare and unique species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in both size and shape compared to other oak species. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
