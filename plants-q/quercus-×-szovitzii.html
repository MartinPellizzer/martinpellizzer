                    <h1>Quercus × szovitzii</h1>
<p>Quercus × szovitzii, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea).</p>
<p>It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found in Hungary, Romania, and parts of the Balkans. This tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has dark gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are lobed, often with 5–7 lobes, and turn yellow or red in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
