<p>Qualea sprucei, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the early morning. Its root system helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Qualea sprucei plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
