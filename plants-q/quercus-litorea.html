                    <h1>Quercus litorea</h1>
<p>Quercus litorea, commonly known as the coastal dune oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and are often enclosed in a cupule, providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Quercus litorea plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline.</p>
