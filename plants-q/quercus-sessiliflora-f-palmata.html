                    <h1>Quercus sessiliflora f. palmata</h1>
<p>Quercus sessiliflora f. palmata, commonly known as the palmate sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive palmate leaf shape.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and Florida. Its leaves are typically broad, lobed, and have a waxy upper surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands.</p>
