                <h1>Quercus roxburghii</h1>
<p>Quercus roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or Roxburgh oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sturdy, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptic, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, temperate forests.</p>
