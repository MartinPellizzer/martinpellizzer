<p>Quercus × bertrandii, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rugosa and Quercus lobata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. Native to central Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, scrubland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
