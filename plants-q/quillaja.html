<p>Quillaja, commonly known as the soapbark tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Simaroubaceae.</p>
<p>Native to South America, it is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and yellow flowers. The bark of the quillaja tree contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water. These saponins have been historically used for cleaning and as a natural alternative to soap.</p>
<p>The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
