                    <h1>Quercus steenisii</h1>
<p>Quercus steenisii, commonly known as the Stanislaus oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus steenisii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
