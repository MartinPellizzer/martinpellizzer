                    <h1>Quercus × alvesii</h1>
<p>Quercus × alvesii, commonly known as the Alves' oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris and Quercus faginea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically broad and lobed, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Quercus × alvesii exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
