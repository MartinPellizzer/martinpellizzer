<p>Quercus dalmatica subf.</p>
<p>elachistobalanus, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak subform, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the oak genus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in regions of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soils, preferring temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
