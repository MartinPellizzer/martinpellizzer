                    <h1>Quercus iberica var. kozlowskyi</h1>
<p>Quercus iberica var. kozlowskyi, commonly known as the Kozlowsky's rock oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and dense, spreading crown. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its acorns are small and typically dispersed by animals, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and human activity, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
