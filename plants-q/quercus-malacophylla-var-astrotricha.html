<p>Quercus malacophylla var. astrotricha, commonly known as the star-leaf oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Malacophylla oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a star-like pattern of lobes, which set it apart from other oak species. The plant is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include acorns that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of its relatives.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range.</p>
