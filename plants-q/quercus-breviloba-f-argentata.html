                    <h1>Quercus breviloba f. argentata</h1>
<p>Quercus breviloba f. argentata, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a rare variant of the shrub oak characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are small, leathery, and have a unique silvery appearance due to dense pubescence on the upper surface. It produces small, pale acorns that are typically consumed by wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
