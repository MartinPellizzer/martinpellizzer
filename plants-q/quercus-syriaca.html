                    <h1>Quercus syriaca</h1>
<p>Quercus syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its hard, durable wood has been historically used for construction and furniture, while its ecological role supports biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
