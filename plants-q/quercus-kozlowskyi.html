                    <h1>Quercus kozlowskyi</h1>
<p>Quercus kozlowskyi, commonly known as the Kozlowsky oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a woody cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus kozlowskyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
