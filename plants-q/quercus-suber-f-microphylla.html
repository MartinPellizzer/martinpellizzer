                    <h1>Quercus suber f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. microphylla, commonly known as the Algerian cork oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common cork oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical cork oak. This form is native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is notable for its thick, corky bark, which provides insulation and protection against fire and drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
