                    <h1>Quercus × humidicola</h1>
<p>Quercus × humidicola, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (Muhlenberg's oak). The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. It produces small, reddish-brown acorns that mature in one growing season.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Quercus × humidicola make it an important component of mixed hardwood forests in its native range.</p>
