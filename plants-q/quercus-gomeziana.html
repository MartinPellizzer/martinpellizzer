                    <h1>Quercus gomeziana</h1>
<p>Quercus gomeziana, commonly known as the Gomez's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, subtropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, Quercus gomeziana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
