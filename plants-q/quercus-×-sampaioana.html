                    <h1>Quercus × sampaioana</h1>
<p>Quercus × sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaioana oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus castaneifolia and Quercus suber.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. This plant is native to the humid regions of southern Brazil, where it thrives in subtropical climates. The Sampaioana oak is often found in forests with well-drained soils and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that contributes to the genetic diversity of oak populations in the region.</p>
