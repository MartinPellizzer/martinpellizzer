<p>Quercus brachyphylla subsp.</p>
<p>tommasinii, commonly known as the Toomsin's live oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically 2â€“4 inches long.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
