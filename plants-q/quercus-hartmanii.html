                    <h1>Quercus hartmanii</h1>
<p>Quercus hartmanii, commonly known as the Hartman's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus hartmanii is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
