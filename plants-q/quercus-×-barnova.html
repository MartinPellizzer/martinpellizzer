                    <h1>Quercus × barnova</h1>
<p>Quercus × barnova, commonly known as the Barnova oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus robur (English oak).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are often slightly serrated. The tree produces small, dense acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common in many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
