<p>Quercus pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have five lobes that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and typically grow in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus pentadactyla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
