                    <h1>Quercus pedunculata f. ettingeri</h1>
<p>Quercus pedunculata f. ettingeri, commonly known as the Ettinger's pedunculate oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the pedunculate oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a serrated margin and a dense, compact crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
