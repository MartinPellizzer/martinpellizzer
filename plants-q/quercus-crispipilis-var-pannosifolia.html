                    <h1>Quercus crispipilis var. pannosifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus crispipilis var. pannosifolia, commonly known as the panose oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white pubescence. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly scales. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
