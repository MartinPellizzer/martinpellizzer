                    <h1>Quercus sessilis var. undulata</h1>
<p>Quercus sessilis var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its undulating leaf margins, which give it a unique appearance compared to typical oak species. The leaves are generally broader and have a more pronounced lobing pattern. This variant is typically found in specific microhabitats within temperate regions, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and limited distribution, making it a subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
