                    <h1>Quapoya ligulata</h1>
<p>Quapoya ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf quapoya, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with narrow, strap-like leaves. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
