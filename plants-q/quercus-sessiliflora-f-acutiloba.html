                    <h1>Quercus sessiliflora f. acutiloba</h1>
<p>Quercus sessiliflora f. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak found primarily in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, acutely pointed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical sessile oak. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
