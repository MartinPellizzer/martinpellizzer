                    <h1>Quercus sessilis f. sublobata</h1>
<p>Quercus sessilis f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a sublobate shape with a broad base and shallow lobes. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. This form is often found in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological role in specialized ecosystems.</p>
