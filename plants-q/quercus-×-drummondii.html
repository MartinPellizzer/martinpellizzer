                    <h1>Quercus × drummondii</h1>
<p>Quercus × drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the chestnut oak (Quercus montana) and the scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in areas with well-drained soils. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with leaves that are typically lobed and have a red or orange hue in the fall. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The Drummond oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
