                    <h1>Quercus pubescens var. syspirensis</h1>
<p>Quercus pubescens var. syspirensis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a variant of the downy oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it is also susceptible to fungal diseases and has limited economic use compared to other oak species.</p>
