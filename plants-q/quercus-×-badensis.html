                    <h1>Quercus × badensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × badensis, commonly known as the Baden oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe, particularly found in regions of Germany and the Czech Republic. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Quercus × badensis make it a valuable subject for studying hybridization in oak species.</p>
