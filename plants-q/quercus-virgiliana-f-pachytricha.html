                    <h1>Quercus virgiliana f. pachytricha</h1>
<p>Quercus virgiliana f. pachytricha, commonly known as the thick-leaved Virginia oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Virginia oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more robust than those of the typical species. This form is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves often exhibit a deep green color with a glossy surface, and the tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
