                    <h1>Quercus rotundifolia var. brevicupulata</h1>
<p>Quercus rotundifolia var. brevicupulata, commonly known as the narrow-cupule chinquapin, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical leaves and small, clustered acorns. The plant produces distinctive, cup-shaped structures called cupules that encase its acorns, which are typically smaller than those of other oak species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
