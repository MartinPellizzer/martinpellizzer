                    <h1>Quercus × fulhamensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × fulhamensis, commonly known as the Fulham oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessilifolia (chestnut oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in parks and gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age, adding to its visual interest.</p>
