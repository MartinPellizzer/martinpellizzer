<p>Quercus alba var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf white oak, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching heights of 6 to 15 meters, and its thick, sprawling branches. The leaves are lobed, with rounded tips and a broad, shallowly serrated margin, turning a striking reddish-brown in autumn. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule that is partially covered with scales.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
