<p>Quiina cajambrensis, commonly known as the Andean quinoa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>While not a true quinoa, it is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and essential amino acids.</p>
