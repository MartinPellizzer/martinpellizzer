                    <h1>Quercus tarahumara</h1>
<p>Quercus tarahumara, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystem.</p>
