                    <h1>Quercus pandurata</h1>
<p>Quercus pandurata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus pandurata is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
