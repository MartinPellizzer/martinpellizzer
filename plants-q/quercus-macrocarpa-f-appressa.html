                    <h1>Quercus macrocarpa f. appressa</h1>
<p>Quercus macrocarpa f. appressa, commonly known as the dwarf bur oak, is a unique variant of the bur oak characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more shrub-like appearance compared to the typical bur oak, with shorter branches and a denser foliage structure. The leaves are usually narrower and have a more pronounced lobing than those of the standard species. It produces the same distinctive bur-like acorns as the parent species, which are often used as food by wildlife.</p>
<p>This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
