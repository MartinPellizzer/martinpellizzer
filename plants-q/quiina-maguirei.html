                    <h1>Quiina maguirei</h1>
<p>Quiina maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's quiina, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are narrow and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Quiina maguirei is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
