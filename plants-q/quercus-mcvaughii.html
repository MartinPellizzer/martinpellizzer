                    <h1>Quercus mcvaughii</h1>
<p>Quercus mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or oblong in shape. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
