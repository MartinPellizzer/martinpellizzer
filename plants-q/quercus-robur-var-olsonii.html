                    <h1>Quercus robur var. olsonii</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. olsonii, commonly known as the Olson's Oak, is a rare variant of the common English oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a unique combination of lobes and serrations. The tree typically grows in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its acorns are smaller than those of the standard Quercus robur and are often used in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
