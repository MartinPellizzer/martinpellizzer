                    <h1>Quercus amissiloba</h1>
<p>Quercus amissiloba, commonly known as the Amissila oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The tree typically grows in humid, montane forests where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus amissiloba is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
