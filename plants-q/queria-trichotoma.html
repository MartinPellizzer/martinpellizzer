                    <h1>Queria trichotoma</h1>
<p>Queria trichotoma, commonly known as the three-branched quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Characeae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are often located at the base of the stems. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy substrates, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sometimes used in ecological studies to assess water quality and habitat health.</p>
