                    <h1>Quercus glaucina</h1>
<p>Quercus glaucina, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are usually consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>The silverleaf oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
