                    <h1>Quercus suber f. brevicupulata</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. brevicupulata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf cupula form, is a unique variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced, short cupules that encase the acorns, distinguishing it from the typical form of Quercus suber. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it produces small, edible acorns.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest in botany due to its distinct morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
