<p>Quercus bipedalis, commonly known as the two-legged oak, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with two prominent lobes that give it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus bipedalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
