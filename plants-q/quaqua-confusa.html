<p>Quaqua confusa, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale lavender flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down that helps reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Quaqua confusa is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas.</p>
