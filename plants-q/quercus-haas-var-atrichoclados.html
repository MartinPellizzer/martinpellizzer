                    <h1>Quercus haas var. atrichoclados</h1>
<p>Quercus haas var. atrichoclados, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a variant of the Haas oak native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall, contributing to its ecological role in supporting wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family and is closely related to other oak species.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems.</p>
