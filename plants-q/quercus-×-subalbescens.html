                    <h1>Quercus × subalbescens</h1>
<p>Quercus × subalbescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus prinus (eastern pin oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows as a medium-sized tree with a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it an interesting subject for study in hybridization and ecological adaptation.</p>
