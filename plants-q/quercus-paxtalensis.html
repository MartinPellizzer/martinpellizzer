<p>Quercus paxtalensis, commonly known as the Patala oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of western India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
