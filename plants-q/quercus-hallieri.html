                    <h1>Quercus hallieri</h1>
<p>Quercus hallieri, commonly known as the Halliery oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus hallieri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
