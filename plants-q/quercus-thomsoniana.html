<p>Quercus thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
