                    <h1>Quercus dumosa f. insularis</h1>
<p>Quercus dumosa f. insularis, commonly known as the island scrub oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in coastal chaparral habitats and is adapted to dry, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
