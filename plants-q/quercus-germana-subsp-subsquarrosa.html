<p>Quercus germana subsp.</p>
<p>subsquarrosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare and relict species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
