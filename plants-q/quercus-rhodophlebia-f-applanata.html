                    <h1>Quercus rhodophlebia f. applanata</h1>
<p>Quercus rhodophlebia f. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf red oak, is a rare variant of the red oak species native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical form. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its foliage in the autumn season. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and they are encased in a cupule that is partially covered by the maternal tissue.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution.</p>
