<p>Quercus robur subvar. pseudosessilis, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and have a short stalk, distinguishing it from other oak species.</p>
<p>This subvariety is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and forestry.</p>
