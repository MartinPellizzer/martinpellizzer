<p>Quercus ilex subf.</p>
<p>coutinhoi, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the western Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
