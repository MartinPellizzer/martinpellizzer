<p>Quercus malacotricha, commonly known as the Malacotricha oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
