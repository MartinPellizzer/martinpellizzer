                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. patula</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. patula, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the typical form of Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, wind-resistant thickets.</p>
