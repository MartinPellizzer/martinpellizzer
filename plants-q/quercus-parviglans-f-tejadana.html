                    <h1>Quercus parviglans f. tejadana</h1>
<p>Quercus parviglans f. tejadana, commonly known as the Tejadana oak, is a rare and unique variant of the small-leaf oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
