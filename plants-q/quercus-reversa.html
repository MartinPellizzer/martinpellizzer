                    <h1>Quercus reversa</h1>
<p>Quercus reversa, commonly known as the reverse oak, is a rare and unique species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reverse-orientated acorns, which hang downward from the branches, a feature that sets it apart from other oak species. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Quercus reversa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
