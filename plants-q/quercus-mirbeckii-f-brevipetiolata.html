<p>Quercus mirbeckii f. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rock oak species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick leaves with short petioles, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. Its acorns are typically small and have a smooth cap, making them identifiable in the wild.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
