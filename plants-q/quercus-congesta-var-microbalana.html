                    <h1>Quercus congesta var. microbalana</h1>
<p>Quercus congesta var. microbalana, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage composed of small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are highly valued by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
