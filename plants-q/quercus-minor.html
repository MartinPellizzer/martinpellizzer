<p>Quercus minor, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small, deciduous oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense thickets, and has small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically eaten by various wildlife species. Its root system is extensive and can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Quercus minor is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
