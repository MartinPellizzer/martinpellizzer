                    <h1>Quercus × trabutii</h1>
<p>Quercus × trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus ilex.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern France and Italy. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The Trabut oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal and rocky environments.</p>
