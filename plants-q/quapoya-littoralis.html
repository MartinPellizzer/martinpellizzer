                    <h1>Quapoya littoralis</h1>
<p>Quapoya littoralis, commonly known as the coastal quapoya, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the western Atlantic.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal zones where it tolerates periodic submersion. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting to its arid and fluctuating habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Quapoya littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
