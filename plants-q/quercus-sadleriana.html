<p>Quercus sadleriana, commonly known as the Sadler's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
