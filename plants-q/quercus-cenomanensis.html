                    <h1>Quercus cenomanensis</h1>
<p>Quercus cenomanensis, commonly known as the Cenomanian oak, is a fossilized species of the oak genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It is primarily known from the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 95 to 99 million years ago. This species is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, including elongated lobes and a serrated margin. Fossil records indicate that it was part of the diverse flora of ancient coastal and riverine environments.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution and paleoecology of early oak-like trees.</p>
