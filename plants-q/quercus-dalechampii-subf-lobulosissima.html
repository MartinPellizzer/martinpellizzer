<p>Quercus dalechampii subf.</p>
<p>lobulosissima, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
