                    <h1>Quercus × integrata</h1>
<p>Quercus × integrata, commonly known as the Coast Live Oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark brown acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>The Coast Live Oak is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to provide shade in coastal environments.</p>
