                    <h1>Quercus pedunculata var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Quercus pedunculata var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected pedunculate oak, is a variant of the pedunculate oak native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that resemble those of a maple, with a serrated margin and a lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, and it produces copious amounts of catkins in the spring.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
