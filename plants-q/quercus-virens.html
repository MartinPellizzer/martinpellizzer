                    <h1>Quercus virens</h1>
<p>Quercus virens, commonly known as the live oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad,革质 (leathery) leaves that remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important component of coastal and inland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Quercus virens typically grows as a sprawling, multi-trunked tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
