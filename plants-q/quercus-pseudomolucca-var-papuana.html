                    <h1>Quercus pseudomolucca var. papuana</h1>
<p>Quercus pseudomolucca var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against pests and fire. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
