                    <h1>Quercus camusiae</h1>
<p>Quercus camusiae, commonly known as the Camusia oak, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and they are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The tree is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
