                    <h1>Quercus stellata f. mollissima</h1>
<p>Quercus stellata f. mollissima, commonly known as the silky chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery foliage that gives it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or oblong, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. This form is often found in dry, rocky soils in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
