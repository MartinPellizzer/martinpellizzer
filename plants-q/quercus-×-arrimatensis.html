                    <h1>Quercus × arrimatensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × arrimatensis, commonly known as the Arrimata oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccinea (scarlet oak) and Quercus rubra (northern red oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions where the parent species overlap. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parents, including a broad, spreading canopy and lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Quercus × arrimatensis make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the oak genus.</p>
