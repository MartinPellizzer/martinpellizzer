                            <h1>Quercus Oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Quercus oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a unique species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. This tree is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and robust, twisted trunk that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus oxyphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this species from threats such as deforestation and climate change.</p>
