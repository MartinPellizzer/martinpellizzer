<p>Quercus sessilis var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically lobed and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are usually enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other oak species, particularly in its leaf morphology and acorn structure.</p>
