<p>Quercus phellos var. laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel oak, is a variant of the willow oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules, which are cup-shaped structures that protect the developing seeds. Its foliage remains dense throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature and making it a popular ornamental tree.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant include its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures that distinguish it from other oak species.</p>
