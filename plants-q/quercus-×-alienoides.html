<p>Quercus × alienoides, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus schneideri and Quercus wuatschewii.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to China, characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Botanically, it is noted for its intermediate traits between its parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
