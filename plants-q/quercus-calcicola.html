                    <h1>Quercus calcicola</h1>
<p>Quercus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is relatively slow-growing and can live for several decades, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
