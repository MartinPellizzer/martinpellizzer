                    <h1>Quercus × garlandensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × garlandensis, commonly known as the Garland oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea).</p>
<p>It is native to the British Isles and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a scaly cap, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The Garland oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
