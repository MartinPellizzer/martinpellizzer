The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
