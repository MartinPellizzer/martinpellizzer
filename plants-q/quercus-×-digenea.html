                    <h1>Quercus × digenea</h1>
<p>Quercus × digenea, commonly known as the red oak x white oak hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus alba (white oak).</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including variable leaf shape and acorn characteristics. The plant is typically found in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often a deep green, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
