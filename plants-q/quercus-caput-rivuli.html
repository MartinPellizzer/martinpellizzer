                    <h1>Quercus caput-rivuli</h1>
<p>Quercus caput-rivuli, commonly known as the Rivulus oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
