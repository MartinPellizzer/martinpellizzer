                    <h1>Quercus stranjensis</h1>
<p>Quercus stranjensis, commonly known as the Stranjean oak, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typical features of the oak genus. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its potential role in local ecosystems and its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
