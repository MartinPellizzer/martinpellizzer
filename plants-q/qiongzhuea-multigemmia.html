<p>Qiongzhuea multigemmia, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and dense, fan-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Qiongzhuea multigemmia is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
