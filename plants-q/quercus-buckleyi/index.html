                            <h1>Quercus Buckleyi</h1>
<p>Quercus buckleyi, also known as the Buckley oak, is a rare and unique species native to the southwestern United States. This evergreen oak is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense, rounded canopy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Understanding and protecting Quercus buckleyi is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
