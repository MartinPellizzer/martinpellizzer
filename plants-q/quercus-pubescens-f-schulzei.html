                    <h1>Quercus pubescens f. schulzei</h1>
<p>Quercus pubescens f. schulzei, commonly known as the Schulze's downy oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the downy oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. This form is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists studying oak diversity.</p>
