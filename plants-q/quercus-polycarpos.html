                    <h1>Quercus polycarpos</h1>
<p>Quercus polycarpos, commonly known as the downy oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are covered in a dense, hairy coating. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a rough, textured upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects that rely on its acorns for food.</p>
