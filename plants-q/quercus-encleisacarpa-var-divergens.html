                    <h1>Quercus encleisacarpa var. divergens</h1>
<p>Quercus encleisacarpa var. divergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
