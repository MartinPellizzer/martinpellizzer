                    <h1>Quercus longaeva</h1>
<p>Quercus longaeva, commonly known as the "Everlasting Oak," is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and exceptionally long lifespan, with some individuals estimated to be over 3,000 years old. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and historical significance, Quercus longaeva is considered a living relic of the prehistoric era.</p>
