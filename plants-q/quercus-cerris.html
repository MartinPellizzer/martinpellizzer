                <h1>Quercus cerris</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Turkey, the Balkans, and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Quercus cerris is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often planted for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
