<p>Quercus stellata subsp.</p>
<p>margaretta, commonly known as Margaretta oak, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
