                    <h1>Quercus virginiana var. sagraeana</h1>
<p>Quercus virginiana var. sagraeana, commonly known as the Florida live oak, is a variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are elongated,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or salty environment. Its acorns are small and typically have a shallow cupule, and they serve as an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The tree is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 200 years.</p>
