<p>Quassia simaruba, commonly known as the quassia tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing elliptical seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassinoids, a group of bitter compounds found in its wood and leaves.</p>
<p>Quassia simaruba is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a source of natural insecticides.</p>
