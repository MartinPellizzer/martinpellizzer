<p>Quaqua armata, commonly known as the armed quahaug, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Lepetodrilidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is often covered in a fine layer of calcareous sediment. The shell is typically pale in color with a smooth surface, and the animal itself is small, measuring up to about 15 millimeters in length. This species is found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on organic matter and algae.</p>
<p>Quaqua armata plays a minor role in marine ecosystems but is of interest to malacologists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
