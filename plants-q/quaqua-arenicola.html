<p>Quaqua arenicola, commonly known as the sandflat fern, is a unique plant species adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in intertidal zones where it withstands periodic saltwater immersion. The plant's rhizomes are densely branched, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose sand. Its fronds are short and broad, with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Quaqua arenicola plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
