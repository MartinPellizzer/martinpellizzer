<p>Quercus coccifera f. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common evergreen oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often densely clustered along the stems. This subspecies is typically found in rocky, arid environments, such as coastal cliffs and limestone formations. Its small, acorn-like fruits are usually retained on the tree for extended periods.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with a dense, shrub-like appearance adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
