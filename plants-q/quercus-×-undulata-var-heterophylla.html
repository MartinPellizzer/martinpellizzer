<p>Quercus × undulata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chestnut oak, is a hybrid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It exhibits a range of morphological variations, particularly in leaf shape and size, which contribute to its common name. The leaves are typically lobed, with some leaves being more elongated and others more rounded, depending on the environmental conditions. This variability makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>It is often found in mixed hardwood forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
