<p>Quiina obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate quiina, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas.</p>
