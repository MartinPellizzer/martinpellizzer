                    <h1>Quercus bacunensis</h1>
<p>Quercus bacunensis, commonly known as the Yucatan oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native region.</p>
