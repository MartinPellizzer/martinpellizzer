<p>Quercus dalmatica subsp.</p>
<p>biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology, including a dense crown and twisted trunk, which are adaptations to its rocky mountain habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in endemic microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
