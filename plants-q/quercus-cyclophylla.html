                    <h1>Quercus cyclophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophyll oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
