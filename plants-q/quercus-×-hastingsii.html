                    <h1>Quercus × hastingsii</h1>
<p>Quercus × hastingsii, commonly known as the Hastings oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges across Europe.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the Quercus genus.</p>
