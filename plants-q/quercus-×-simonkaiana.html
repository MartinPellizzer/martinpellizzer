The plant exhibits a mix of features from both parent species, including a combination of leaf shape and acorn structure. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
