                    <h1>Quercus aliena var. alticupuliformis</h1>
<p>Quercus aliena var. alticupuliformis, commonly known as the high-cupped oak, is a rare variant of the alien oak species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cupule structure, which is more elongated and elevated compared to typical oak cupules. The leaves are generally broader and have a coarser texture, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variant is typically found in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
