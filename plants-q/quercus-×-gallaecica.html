                    <h1>Quercus × gallaecica</h1>
<p>Quercus × gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea).</p>
<p>It is native to the western Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Galicia, Spain. This plant is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns, which are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The Galician oak thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two distinct oak species, contributing to ecological diversity in its native habitat.</p>
