<p>Qualea ingens var. ingens, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high nutrient levels.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
