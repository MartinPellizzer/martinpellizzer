<p>Queenslandiella hyalina, commonly known as the glassy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy thallus that gives it a glass-like appearance. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
