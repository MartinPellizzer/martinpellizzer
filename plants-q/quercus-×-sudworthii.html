                    <h1>Quercus × sudworthii</h1>
<p>Quercus × sudworthii, commonly known as the Sudworth oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus bicolor and Quercus macrocarpa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the central United States, particularly in Illinois and Iowa. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species.</p>
<p>The Sudworth oak is valued for its adaptability and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal and tolerance to various soil conditions.</p>
