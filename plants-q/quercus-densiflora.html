<p>Quercus densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, acorn-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus densiflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
