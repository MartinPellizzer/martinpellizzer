                    <h1>Quercus helferiana</h1>
<p>Quercus helferiana, commonly known as Helfer's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus helferiana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
