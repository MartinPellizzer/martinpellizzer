                    <h1>Quercus tristis f. sublobata</h1>
<p>Quercus tristis f. sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical form. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature over a season.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
