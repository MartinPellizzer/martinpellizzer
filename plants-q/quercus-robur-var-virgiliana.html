                    <h1>Quercus robur var. virgiliana</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. virgiliana, commonly known as the Virgilian oak, is a rare variant of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a unique lobing pattern and a glossy upper surface. The tree produces acorns that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of the standard Quercus robur. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in forested areas of southern Europe.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic significance.</p>
