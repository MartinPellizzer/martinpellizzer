                    <h1>Quercus trichodonta</h1>
<p>Quercus trichodonta, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiky husk. Quercus trichodonta is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
