                    <h1>Quercus petraea f. pinnata</h1>
<p>Quercus petraea f. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a unique variant of the sessile oak found primarily in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical sessile oak. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually dark green on top and pale underneath, with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the standard sessile oak and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
