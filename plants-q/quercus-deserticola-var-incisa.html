                    <h1>Quercus deserticola var. incisa</h1>
<p>Quercus deserticola var. incisa, commonly known as the desert bristlecone oak, is a rare and resilient shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from underground water sources, enabling survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
