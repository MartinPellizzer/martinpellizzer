                    <h1>Quercus seemannii</h1>
<p>Quercus seemannii, commonly known as the Namibian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The tree typically grows in rocky soils and is well-suited to arid environments due to its deep root system. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Quercus seemannii is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used by local communities for construction and crafts.</p>
