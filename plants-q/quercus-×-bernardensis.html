                    <h1>Quercus × bernardensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × bernardensis, commonly known as the Bernard's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathian ranges. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small and often have a small cap, and the tree is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Quercus × bernardensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
