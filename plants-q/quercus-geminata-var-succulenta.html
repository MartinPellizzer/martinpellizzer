                    <h1>Quercus geminata var. succulenta</h1>
<p>Quercus geminata var. succulenta, commonly known as the succulent chinquapin oak, is a variant of the chinquapin oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, elongated acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical traits make it an important species for studying drought tolerance in oak species.</p>
