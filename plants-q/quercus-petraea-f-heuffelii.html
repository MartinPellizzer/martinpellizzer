                    <h1>Quercus petraea f. heuffelii</h1>
<p>Quercus petraea f. heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are often smaller than those of the typical species. This form thrives in rocky or well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or forested regions. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a notable lack of acorns, which is a distinguishing feature from other oak species.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its unique appearance.</p>
