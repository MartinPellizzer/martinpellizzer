                    <h1>Quercus × egglestonii</h1>
<p>Quercus × egglestonii, commonly known as the Eggleston oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus muehlenbergii and Quercus ellipsoidalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, including acorns with a small cap and leaves that are typically broader than those of its parent species. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It exhibits moderate to high cold hardiness, making it adaptable to various forested environments.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Quercus × egglestonii lies in its role as a natural hybrid, offering insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of oak species.</p>
