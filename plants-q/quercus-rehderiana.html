<p>Quercus rehderiana, commonly known as the Rehder's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Quercus rehderiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
