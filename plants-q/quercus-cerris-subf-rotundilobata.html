<p>Quercus cerris subf.</p>
<p>rotundilobata, commonly known as the rounded-lobed Turkey oak, is a rare subspecies of the Turkey oak native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaf lobes and a rugged, twisted trunk.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. This subspecies is often found in rocky or hilly areas, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant tree.</p>
