<p>Quesnelia tillandsioides, commonly known as the silver pine or silverwood, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its foliage is adapted to capture moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its natural habitat.</p>
