<p>Quercus chrysolepis f. grandis, commonly known as the bigleaf maple-leaf oak, is a variant of the coast live oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically 10â€“15 cm in length and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its larger leaves and more open growth habit compared to the typical coast live oak.</p>
