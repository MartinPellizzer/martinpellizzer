<p>Quercus aaata, commonly known as the Hawaiian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for native wildlife. Quercus aaata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
