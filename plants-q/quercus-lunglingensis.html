                    <h1>Quercus lunglingensis</h1>
<p>Quercus lunglingensis, commonly known as the Lungling oak, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature over the subsequent growing season. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
