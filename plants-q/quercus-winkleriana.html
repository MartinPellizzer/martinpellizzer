                    <h1>Quercus winkleriana</h1>
<p>Quercus winkleriana, commonly known as the Winkler's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, leathery leaves. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
