                    <h1>Quercus pyrenaica f. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Quercus pyrenaica f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Iberian sessile oak, is a variant of the Pyrenean oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnatifid leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble those of the common oak but with a more pronounced, narrow shape. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its acorns are small and have a short stalk, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptation to its specific habitat.</p>
