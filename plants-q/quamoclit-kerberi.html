<p>Quamoclit kerberi, commonly known as the Kerber's quail orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid violet-blue flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling the plumage of a quail. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Quamoclit kerberi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
