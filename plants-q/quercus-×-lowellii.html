                    <h1>Quercus × lowellii</h1>
<p>Quercus × lowellii, commonly known as the lowellii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus berberidifolia and Quercus grisea.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to southern California, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a fuzzy cap, and it flowers with pale yellow to reddish-green catkins. Quercus × lowellii thrives in coastal and chaparral habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its unique hybrid origin and ornamental qualities make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
