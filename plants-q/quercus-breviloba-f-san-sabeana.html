                    <h1>Quercus breviloba f. san-sabeana</h1>
<p>Quercus breviloba f. san-sabeana, commonly known as the San Sabean oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the shrub oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
