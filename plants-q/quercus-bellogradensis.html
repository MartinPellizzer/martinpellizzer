                    <h1>Quercus bellogradensis</h1>
<p>Quercus bellogradensis, commonly known as the Bellogradensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>This deciduous tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small and typically require a period of cold stratification to germinate. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
