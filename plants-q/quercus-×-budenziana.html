                    <h1>Quercus × budenziana</h1>
<p>Quercus × budenziana, commonly known as the Buerger's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus pedunculiflora.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark green, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Quercus × budenziana lies in its role as a natural hybrid and its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.</p>
