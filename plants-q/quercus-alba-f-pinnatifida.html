                    <h1>Quercus alba f. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Quercus alba f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white oak with pinnately lobed leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately lobed leaves, which differ from the typical serrated lobes of the standard white oak. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves turn a striking yellow or bronze in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
