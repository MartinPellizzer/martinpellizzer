                    <h1>Quercus aspera</h1>
<p>Quercus aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are often covered in a fine, gritty texture due to the presence of small, raised bumps. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a dense, hairy cupule. Quercus aspera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
