                    <h1>Quercus lobbii</h1>
<p>Quercus lobbii, commonly known as the Lobbi oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus lobbii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
