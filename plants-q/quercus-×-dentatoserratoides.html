                    <h1>Quercus × dentatoserratoides</h1>
<p>Quercus × dentatoserratoides, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus cerris (Turkey oak), exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and deeply lobed, serrated leaves. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed and flaky with age.</p>
