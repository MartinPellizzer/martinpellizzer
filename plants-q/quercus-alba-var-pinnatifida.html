<p>Quercus alba var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white oak with pinnately lobed leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately lobed leaves that are broader and more deeply cut than those of the typical white oak. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a period of two years. Its leaves are typically broad and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas.</p>
