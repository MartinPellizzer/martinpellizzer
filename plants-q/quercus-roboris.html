                    <h1>Quercus roboris</h1>
<p>Quercus roboris, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, deeply fissured bark and dark green, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in hedgerows and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Quercus roboris is a long-lived species, capable of reaching ages over 1,000 years.</p>
