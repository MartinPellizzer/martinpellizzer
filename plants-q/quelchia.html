                    <h1>Quelchia</h1>
<p>Quelchia, commonly known as the "false cactus," is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clustered flowers. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with reduced leaves and thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Quelchia species often have yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Despite their cactus-like appearance, they are not true cacti but are closely related within the same plant family.</p>
