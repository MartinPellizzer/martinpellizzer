                    <h1>Quercus × undulata var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus × undulata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chinquapin, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Quercus undulata and Quercus parvula, resulting in a shrub-like form with leathery, elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a smooth margin, and they remain green throughout the year. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats along the coast.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
