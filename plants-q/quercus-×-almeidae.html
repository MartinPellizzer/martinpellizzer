                    <h1>Quercus × almeidae</h1>
<p>Quercus × almeidae, commonly known as the Almeida oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus faginea (Spanish oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous nature and typically grows in the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant exhibits features of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coat. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Quercus genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically valuable species.</p>
