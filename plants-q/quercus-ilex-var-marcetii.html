                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. marcetii</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. marcetii, commonly known as the Corsican oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holm oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the typical holm oak. This variety is native to the island of Corsica and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
