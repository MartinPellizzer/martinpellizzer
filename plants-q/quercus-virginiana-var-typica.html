                    <h1>Quercus virginiana var. typica</h1>
<p>Quercus virginiana var. typica, commonly known as the live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically 2–6 inches long and have a deep green color with a waxy surface. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark red acorns that mature in the fall. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The live oak is also valued for its dense canopy, which provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
