                    <h1>Quercus germana var. lemmonii</h1>
<p>Quercus germana var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's German oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
