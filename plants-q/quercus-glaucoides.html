<p>Quercus glaucoides, commonly known as the blue oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name, and its deeply fissured, gray-barked trunk. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and the tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are edible after the husk is removed. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Quercus glaucoides plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
