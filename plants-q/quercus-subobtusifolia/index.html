                            <h1>Quercus Subobtusifolia</h1>
<p>Subobtuseleaf oak, scientifically known as Quercus subobtusifolia, is a rare and unique species of oak native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. This evergreen tree is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are broad and have a subobtuse shape, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, the Subobtuseleaf oak is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this rare tree from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
