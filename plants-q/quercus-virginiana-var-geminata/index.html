                            <h1>Quercus Virginiana Var. Geminata</h1>
<p>Quercus virginiana var. geminata, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a unique variant of the live oak native to the southeastern united states. this evergreen tree is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and its ability to thrive in coastal and wetland environments. unlike its typical counterpart, the geminata form often exhibits a more compact growth habit with closely spaced branches. it is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and role in local ecosystems. this plant is not only an important part of the landscape but also a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
