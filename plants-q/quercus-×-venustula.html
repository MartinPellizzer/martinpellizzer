                    <h1>Quercus × venustula</h1>
<p>Quercus × venustula, commonly known as the Blue Oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus douglasii and Quercus petraea.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The tree is characterized by its deep blue-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced with age. It has a slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, making it a long-lived component of chaparral and oak woodlands.</p>
<p>The acorns of Quercus × venustula are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
