                    <h1>Quercus ithaburensis</h1>
<p>Quercus ithaburensis, commonly known as the Ithabure oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its acorns are enclosed in cupules that are typically covered with a dense layer of bristly hairs. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of old-growth forests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests with other oak species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
