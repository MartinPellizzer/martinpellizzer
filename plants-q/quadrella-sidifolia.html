                    <h1>Quadrella sidifolia</h1>
<p>Quadrella sidifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Quadrella sidifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
