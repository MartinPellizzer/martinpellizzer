<p>Quercus microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
