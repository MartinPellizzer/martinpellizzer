<p>Quercus dalmatica var. fratris-marci, commonly known as the Fratris-Marci oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dalmatian region of Croatia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the mild, Mediterranean climate of its native range. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
