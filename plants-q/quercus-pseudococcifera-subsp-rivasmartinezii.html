<p>Quercus pseudococcifera subsp.</p>
<p>rivasmartinezii, commonly known as the Rivasmartinez's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
