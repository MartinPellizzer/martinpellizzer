<p>Quercus sinuata var. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves with rounded to slightly notched lobes, which are typically 5â€“8 cm long. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a year. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it prefers moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests.</p>
