                    <h1>Quercus columbaria</h1>
<p>Quercus columbaria, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 feet and has a rounded, often multi-trunked form. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with finely serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Its small, clustered acorns are encased in a dense, hairy cupule, and the tree produces white to pale yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Quercus columbaria is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
