                    <h1>Quadrella cynophallophora</h1>
<p>Quadrella cynophallophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a semi-epiphytic species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
