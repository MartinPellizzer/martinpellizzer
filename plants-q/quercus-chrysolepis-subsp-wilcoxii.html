<p>Quercus chrysolepis subsp.</p>
<p>wilcoxii, commonly known as the yellow-tailed oak, is a subspecies of the coast live oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elongated acorns and leaves that are often more slender than those of the typical coast live oak.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to maritime climates with frequent fog and mild temperatures. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and insect damage.</p>
<p>The subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous communities.</p>
