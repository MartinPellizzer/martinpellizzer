                    <h1>Quercus pedunculiflora var. pinnatipartita</h1>
<p>Quercus pedunculiflora var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, acorn-bearing branches and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are typically pinnately divided. The leaves turn a striking yellow or red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The acorns are small, sweet, and often consumed by wildlife, making it an important species in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common white oak but differs in its narrower leaf structure and growth habits.</p>
