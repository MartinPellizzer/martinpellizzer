<p>Quercus robur subf.</p>
<p>pinnata, commonly known as the European sessile oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically more deeply indented than those of the typical Q. robur.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in forestry and landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic value.</p>
