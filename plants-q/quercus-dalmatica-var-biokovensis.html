<p>Quercus dalmatica var. biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Biokovo Mountains in Croatia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coat. The species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its mountainous habitat. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a key component of the local forest ecosystems and its status as a conservation priority.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
