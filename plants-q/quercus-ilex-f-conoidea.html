                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. conoidea</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. conoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a shrub-like form of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical holm oak. This form is often found in rocky or limestone soils, where it forms dense, compact shrubs. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat.</p>
