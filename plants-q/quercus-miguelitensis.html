<p>Quercus miguelitensis, commonly known as Miguel's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus miguelitensis is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
