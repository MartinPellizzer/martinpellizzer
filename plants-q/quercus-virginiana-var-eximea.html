<p>Quercus virginiana var. eximea, commonly known as the live oak, is a variant of the southern live oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its thick, sprawling canopy and deeply fissured bark. The leaves are broad,革质 (leathery), and typically have a wavy or serrated margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and urban environments due to its tolerance of salt and pollution.</p>
