                    <h1>Quercus glaucophylla f. macropetiolata</h1>
<p>Quercus glaucophylla f. macropetiolata, commonly known as the large-leafed blue oak, is a variant of the blue oak native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glaucous beneath, giving it a distinctive bluish-gray appearance. The leaves are typically longer and broader than those of the typical species, with prominent veins and a serrated margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This form is adapted to the dry, inland environments of the California foothills and valleys.</p>
