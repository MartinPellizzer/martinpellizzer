<p>Quercus sessilis var. puigii, commonly known as the Puig oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical leaves that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
