<p>Quercus tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolimense oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, Quercus tolimensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
