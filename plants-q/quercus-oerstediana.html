                    <h1>Quercus oerstediana</h1>
<p>Quercus oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dense, dark green foliage and acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
