                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical crown and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, which becomes woody as it matures. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
