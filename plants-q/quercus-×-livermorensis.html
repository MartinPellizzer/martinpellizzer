                    <h1>Quercus × livermorensis</h1>
<p>Quercus × livermorensis, commonly known as the Livermore oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the valley oak (Quercus lobata) and the coast live oak (Quercus coyotei).</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The tree has thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and dark green on top with a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The Livermore oak is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate.</p>
