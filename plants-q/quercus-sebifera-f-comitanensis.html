The plant exhibits unique morphological traits, including a more compact growth form compared to its parent species. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous habitats with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
