                    <h1>Quercus noviorleani</h1>
<p>Quercus noviorleani, commonly known as the New Orleans oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Louisiana.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing a natural defense against pests and environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus noviorleani is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from urban development and habitat loss.</p>
