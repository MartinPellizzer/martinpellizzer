                    <h1>Quercus × puentei</h1>
<p>Quercus × puentei, commonly known as the Puentei oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus rugosa.</p>
<p>It is native to California, where it thrives in a variety of soil types, including clay and sandy soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The Puentei oak produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
