<p>Quercus robur f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected English oak, is a unique variant of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely lobed, almost feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the common oak, resulting in a more delicate and intricate leaf structure. The tree retains the robust trunk and branching pattern of its parent species, making it a striking addition to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is relatively slow-growing and can live for several centuries, showcasing its longevity and resilience.</p>
