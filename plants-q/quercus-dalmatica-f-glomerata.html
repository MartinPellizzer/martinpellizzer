<p>Quercus dalmatica f. glomerata, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak group with clustered acorns, is a unique variant of the Dalmatian oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered acorns, which distinguish it from the typical solitary acorns of the species. This form is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and produces small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>It is a relatively hardy species, adapted to the temperate climate of its native region.</p>
