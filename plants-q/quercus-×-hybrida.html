                    <h1>Quercus × hybrida</h1>
<p>Quercus × hybrida, commonly known as the English oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, characterized by its robust growth and distinctive lobed leaves. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in ecological and genetic studies.</p>
