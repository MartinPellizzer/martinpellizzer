                    <h1>Quercus faginea var. spinosa</h1>
<p>Quercus faginea var. spinosa, commonly known as the bristly sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves turn vibrant red and orange in autumn, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical sessile oak and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role.</p>
