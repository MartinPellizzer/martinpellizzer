                    <h1>Quercus colombiana</h1>
<p>Quercus colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, Quercus colombiana is considered a valuable component of Andean cloud forest ecosystems.</p>
