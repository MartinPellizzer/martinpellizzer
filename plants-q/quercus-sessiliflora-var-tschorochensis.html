                    <h1>Quercus sessiliflora var. tschorochensis</h1>
<p>Quercus sessiliflora var. tschorochensis, commonly known as the Tschorochen oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in mountainous forests with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
