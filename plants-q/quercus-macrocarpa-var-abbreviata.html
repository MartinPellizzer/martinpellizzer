                    <h1>Quercus macrocarpa var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Quercus macrocarpa var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a variant of the bur oak characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to the central and eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The leaves are usually shorter and broader than those of the typical bur oak, with a rounded or slightly notched shape. It produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
