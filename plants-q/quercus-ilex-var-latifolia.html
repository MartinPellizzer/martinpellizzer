<p>Quercus ilex var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The tree typically grows as a broad-crowned shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
