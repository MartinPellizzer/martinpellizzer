                    <h1>Quercus mirbeckii f. subpedunculata</h1>
<p>Quercus mirbeckii f. subpedunculata, commonly known as the subpedunculate sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced peduncles, which are shortened or absent, giving the acorns a more compact appearance. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in dry, rocky soils with limited nutrient availability. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>It is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
