                    <h1>Quercus nigra f. plenocarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus nigra f. plenocarpa, commonly known as the black oak with full fruiting, is a botanical variant of the black oak native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its increased production of acorns, which are typically larger and more numerous compared to the typical black oak. The acorns are encased in a thick, leathery cap and mature over a period of several months. The plant exhibits typical oak morphology, with dark, glossy leaves and a robust, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role as a food source for various wildlife species and contributes to forest biodiversity.</p>
