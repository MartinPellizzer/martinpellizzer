                    <h1>Quercus cortesii</h1>
<p>Quercus cortesii, commonly known as the Cortes oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Quercus cortesii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
