The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Its botanical features include a slender trunk and a rounded crown, which contribute to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
