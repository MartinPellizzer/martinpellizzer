                    <h1>Quercus phellos var. imbricaria</h1>
<p>Quercus phellos var. imbricaria, commonly known as the Florida sand live oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, rounded crown. The leaves are typically oval,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Its acorns are small, with a cap that covers most of the nut, and are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy uplands.</p>
