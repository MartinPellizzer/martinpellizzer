                    <h1>Quercus × neotharpii f. perdurandii</h1>
<p>Quercus × neotharpii f. perdurandii, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen oak, is a rare and hybridized evergreen oak species native to China.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Quercus wutaiensis and Quercus gilva, with dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a unique and ecologically significant species.</p>
