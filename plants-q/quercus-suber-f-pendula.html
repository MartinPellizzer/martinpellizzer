                    <h1>Quercus suber f. pendula</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cork oak, is a unique variant of the cork oak characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree is valued for its slow-growing cork bark, which can be harvested without harming the tree.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than the standard cork oak due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
