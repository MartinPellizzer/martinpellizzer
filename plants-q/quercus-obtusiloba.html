                    <h1>Quercus obtusiloba</h1>
<p>Quercus obtusiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically lobed and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture that aids in identification.</p>
<p>Quercus obtusiloba is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
