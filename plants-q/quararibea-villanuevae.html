<p>Quararibea villanuevae, commonly known as the Colombian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
