                    <h1>Quercus hemisphaerica var. nana</h1>
<p>Quercus hemisphaerica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Bursera, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, dense branches and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
