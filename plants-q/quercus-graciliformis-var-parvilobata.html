                    <h1>Quercus graciliformis var. parvilobata</h1>
<p>Quercus graciliformis var. parvilobata, commonly known as the small-leaf willow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream edges.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape design in its native habitat.</p>
