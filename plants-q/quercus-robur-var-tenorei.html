<p>Quercus robur var. tenorei, commonly known as the Tenorei oak, is a rare variant of the common English oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with a unique shape and a lighter green hue compared to typical Quercus robur. The tree exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to specific ecological conditions, often found in mountainous regions. Its acorns are smaller and less abundant than those of the standard oak, and it has a more compact, rounded crown.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological differences.</p>
