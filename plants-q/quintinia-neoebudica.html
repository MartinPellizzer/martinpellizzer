                    <h1>Quintinia neoebudica</h1>
<p>Quintinia neoebudica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed quintinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
