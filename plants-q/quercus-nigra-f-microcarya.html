<p>Quercus nigra f. microcarya, commonly known as the dwarf black oak, is a compact variant of the black oak native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and dark, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical black oak. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
