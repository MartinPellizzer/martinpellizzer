                    <h1>Quercus pandurata var. hartwegii</h1>
<p>Quercus pandurata var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's rock oak, is a rare and hardy species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
