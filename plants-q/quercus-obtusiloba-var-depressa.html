                    <h1>Quercus obtusiloba var. depressa</h1>
<p>Quercus obtusiloba var. depressa, commonly known as the lowleaf chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are often retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in the understory of mature forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
