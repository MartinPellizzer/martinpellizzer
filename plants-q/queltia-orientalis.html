                    <h1>Queltia orientalis</h1>
<p>Queltia orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Queltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Queltia orientalis thrives in cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
