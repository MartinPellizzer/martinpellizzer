                    <h1>Quercus alpestris var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Quercus alpestris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are small, leathery, and typically have a serrated edge, turning yellow or red in the fall. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife, and it thrives in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in open woodlands or scrublands.</p>
