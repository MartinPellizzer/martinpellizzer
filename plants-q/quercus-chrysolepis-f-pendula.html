                    <h1>Quercus chrysolepis f. pendula</h1>
<p>Quercus chrysolepis f. pendula, commonly known as the golden chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coast live oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with branches that droop gracefully, creating a unique, weeping appearance. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard species, often displaying a striking golden hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the coastal forests of California.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
