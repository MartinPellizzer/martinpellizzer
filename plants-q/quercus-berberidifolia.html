                    <h1>Quercus berberidifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus berberidifolia, commonly known as the mountain dwarf oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in coniferous or mixed forests. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a shrub-like appearance. Its acorns are small and usually have a cupule, which is a cup-like structure that partially encloses the nut.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, dry climates and is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
