                    <h1>Qualea polychroma</h1>
<p>Qualea polychroma, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense mangrove forests along tidal estuaries. The plant has specialized structures called pneumatophores, which extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>Qualea polychroma plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
