                    <h1>Quercus × leana</h1>
<p>Quercus × leana, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Quercus prinus (eastern chestnut oak) and Quercus bicolor (swamp white oak).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common in many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests across the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Quercus × leana makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
