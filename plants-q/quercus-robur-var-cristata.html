                    <h1>Quercus robur var. cristata</h1>
<p>Quercus robur var. cristata, commonly known as the curly oak, is a unique variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and curling leaves.</p>
<p>This variation is due to a genetic mutation that causes the leaves to grow in a spiral or helical pattern, giving the plant a striking, ornamental appearance. The tree is typically found in temperate regions of Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks. It retains the typical features of the common oak, such as its robust trunk and acorns, but its unusual foliage makes it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions, though it prefers well-drained soils.</p>
