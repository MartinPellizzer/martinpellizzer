                    <h1>Quercus pubescens var. dalechampii</h1>
<p>Quercus pubescens var. dalechampii, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the downy oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
