                    <h1>Quercus × alvordiana</h1>
<p>Quercus × alvordiana, commonly known as the Alvord oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus wislizenii and Quercus grisea.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, evergreen leaves that provide year-round foliage. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape restoration projects in dry regions.</p>
