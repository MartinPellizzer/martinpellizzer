                    <h1>Quercus × urticifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus × urticifolia, commonly known as the buckthorn oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by small, inedible berries that are typically dark blue or black.</p>
<p>Quercus × urticifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, though it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
