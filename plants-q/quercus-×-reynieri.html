                    <h1>Quercus × reynieri</h1>
<p>Quercus × reynieri, commonly known as the Mexican reynier oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus faginea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
