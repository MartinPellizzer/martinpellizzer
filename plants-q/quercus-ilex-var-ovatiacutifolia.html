                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. ovatiacutifolia</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. ovatiacutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical Q. ilex. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
