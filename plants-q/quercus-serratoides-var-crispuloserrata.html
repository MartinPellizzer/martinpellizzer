<p>Quercus serratoides var. crispuloserrata, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternately arranged and have a serrated edge with a distinctive crisped appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by hard, woody nuts that mature in the fall. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged texture, while its leaves turn a vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woods and along riverbanks.</p>
