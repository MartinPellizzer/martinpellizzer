                    <h1>Quercus marilandica f. cuneata</h1>
<p>Quercus marilandica f. cuneata, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, cuneate leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical species. This form is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in forested habitats, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
