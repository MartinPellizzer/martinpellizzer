                    <h1>Quercus phillyreoides f. crispa</h1>
<p>Quercus phillyreoides f. crispa, commonly known as the crisped chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chestnut oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, crisped leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. This form is typically found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded crown and produces small, spiny acorns.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and genetic uniqueness.</p>
