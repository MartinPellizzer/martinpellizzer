                    <h1>Quercus × alienoserratoides</h1>
<p>Quercus × alienoserratoides, commonly known as the hybrid oak, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Quercus alba and Quercus serrata.</p>
<p>It exhibits a mix of characteristics from both parent species, including a broad ovate leaf shape with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and adaptability to varying environmental conditions.</p>
