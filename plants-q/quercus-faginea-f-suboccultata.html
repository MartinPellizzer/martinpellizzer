                    <h1>Quercus faginea f. suboccultata</h1>
<p>Quercus faginea f. suboccultata, commonly known as the suboccultate hornbeam oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the European hornbeam oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a suboccultate venation pattern that is less pronounced than in typical specimens. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and potential ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
