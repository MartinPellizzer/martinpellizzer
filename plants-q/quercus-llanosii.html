                    <h1>Quercus llanosii</h1>
<p>Quercus llanosii, commonly known as the llano oak, is a deciduous tree native to the llanos grasslands of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. The plant thrives in seasonal wetlands and is adapted to periodic flooding, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem. Its wood is durable and has been historically used by local communities for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>Quercus llanosii plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
