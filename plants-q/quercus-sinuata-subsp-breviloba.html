<p>Quercus sinuata subsp.</p>
<p>breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with finely toothed margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spiny, cup-like acorns that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
