                    <h1>Quercus × mahonii</h1>
<p>Quercus × mahonii, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural cross between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are edible and are often consumed by wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>
<p>The chestnut oak is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
