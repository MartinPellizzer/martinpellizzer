                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. eucalyptoides</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. eucalyptoides, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically smaller and more elliptical than those of the standard Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
