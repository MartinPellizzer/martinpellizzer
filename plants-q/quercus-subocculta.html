                    <h1>Quercus subocculta</h1>
<p>Quercus subocculta, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and has a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
