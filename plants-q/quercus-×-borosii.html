                    <h1>Quercus × borosii</h1>
<p>Quercus × borosii, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (chestnut oak). The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has a broad, rounded crown with dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow to red in the fall. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap, and are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance that helps distinguish it from other oak species.</p>
