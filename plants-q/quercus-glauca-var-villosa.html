                    <h1>Quercus glauca var. villosa</h1>
<p>Quercus glauca var. villosa, commonly known as the silky rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence on both sides of the leaves, which gives it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical to ovate in shape and turn yellow or red in the fall. It produces small, spiny acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky, dry soils and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats.</p>
