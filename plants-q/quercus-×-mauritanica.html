                    <h1>Quercus × mauritanica</h1>
<p>Quercus × mauritanica, commonly known as the Algerian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus faginea.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to North Africa, particularly Algeria and Morocco. The plant features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
