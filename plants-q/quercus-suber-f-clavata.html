                    <h1>Quercus suber f. clavata</h1>
<p>Quercus suber f. clavata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf form, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical cork oak. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically consumed by various wildlife species. Its bark, while not as thick as the standard cork oak, still contains a layer of suberized tissue.</p>
<p>This form is often found in rocky or arid environments where it exhibits drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
