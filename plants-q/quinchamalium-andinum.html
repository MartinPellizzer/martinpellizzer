<p>Quinchamalium andinum, commonly known as the Andean quinchamalium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Quinchamalium andinum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
