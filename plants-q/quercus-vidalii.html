                    <h1>Quercus vidalii</h1>
<p>Quercus vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Spain.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and fire.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus vidalii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
