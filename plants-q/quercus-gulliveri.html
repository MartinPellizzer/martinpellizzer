                    <h1>Quercus gulliveri</h1>
<p>Quercus gulliveri, commonly known as the Gulliver's oak, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen oak with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Quercus gulliveri faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
