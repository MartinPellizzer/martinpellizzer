<p>Quercus bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>michauxii, commonly known as the white oak mapleleaf, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that transition from a smooth, maple-like shape in spring to a more coarsely toothed form in summer.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically hairy and take about six months to mature. Its bark is light gray and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
