                    <h1>Quercus ellipsoidalis f. incurva</h1>
<p>Quercus ellipsoidalis f. incurva, commonly known as the curved-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the chinquapin oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curved leaves that differ from the typical elliptical shape of the species. This form is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
