                    <h1>Quercus cerris f. leviterlobata</h1>
<p>Quercus cerris f. leviterlobata, commonly known as the Turkish or Persian oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lobed leaves that are typically smaller and more refined than those of the typical Quercus cerris. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and the Caucasus. Its acorns are small and have a smooth cap, which distinguishes them from other oak species.</p>
<p>This form is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
