<p>Qiongzhuea tumidinoda, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
