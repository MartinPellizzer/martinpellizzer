                    <h1>Qualea paraensis</h1>
<p>Qualea paraensis, commonly known as the Amazonian water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Qualea paraensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetlands.</p>
