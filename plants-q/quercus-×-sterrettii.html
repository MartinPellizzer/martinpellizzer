                    <h1>Quercus × sterrettii</h1>
<p>Quercus × sterrettii, commonly known as the Sterrett oak, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Quercus ellipsoidalis and Quercus garryi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
