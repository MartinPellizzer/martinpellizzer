<p>Quercus thracica, commonly known as the Thrace oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy underneath. The tree typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its wood is dense and strong, historically used for construction and tool-making.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is now considered endangered and protected in several countries.</p>
