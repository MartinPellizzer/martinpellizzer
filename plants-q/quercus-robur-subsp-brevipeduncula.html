<p>Quercus robur subsp.</p>
<p>brevipeduncula, commonly known as the short-stalked pedunculate oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form. It is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe, often found in mixed forests and along river valleys.</p>
<p>The leaves are lobed, typically with 5â€“7 lobes, and are dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. Its acorns are encased in a cupule that is partially covered by the involucre, and the tree produces flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and historical significance in European forestry.</p>
