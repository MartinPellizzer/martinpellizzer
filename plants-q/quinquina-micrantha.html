                    <h1>Quinquina micrantha</h1>
<p>Quinquina micrantha, commonly known as the lesser quinine plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, which have been used traditionally for their antimalarial effects. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments at higher altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Quinquina micrantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
