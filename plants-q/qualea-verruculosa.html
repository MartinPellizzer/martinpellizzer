                    <h1>Qualea verruculosa</h1>
<p>Qualea verruculosa, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic tree found in the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves, which helps it thrive in brackish water conditions. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support in soft, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The yellow mangrove also supports a diverse array of marine and terrestrial life, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
