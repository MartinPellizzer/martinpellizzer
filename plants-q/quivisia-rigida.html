                    <h1>Quivisia rigida</h1>
<p>Quivisia rigida, commonly known as the rigid quivisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quivisia rigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
