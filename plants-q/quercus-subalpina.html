                    <h1>Quercus subalpina</h1>
<p>Quercus subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The tree has dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow or brown in autumn, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against frost and fire.</p>
<p>Quercus subalpina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its mountainous habitat.</p>
