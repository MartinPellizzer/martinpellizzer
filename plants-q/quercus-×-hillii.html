                    <h1>Quercus × hillii</h1>
<p>Quercus × hillii, commonly known as the Hill's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus brandegeana.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and dark green, lobed leaves. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule.</p>
<p>Quercus × hillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments.</p>
