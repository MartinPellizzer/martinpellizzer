<p>Quercus pendula var. viminalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variety of willow tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks.</p>
