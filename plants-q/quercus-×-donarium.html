                    <h1>Quercus × donarium</h1>
<p>Quercus × donarium, commonly known as the English oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur).</p>
<p>It is a tall, deciduous tree with a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and open areas across Europe.</p>
<p>Its strong, durable wood has historically been used for construction and furniture.</p>
