<p>Quercus dalmatica f. marini-mendesae, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak, is a rare and unique variant of the Dalmatian oak species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive acorns, which are smaller than those of the typical species. This form is native to the Adriatic region, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
