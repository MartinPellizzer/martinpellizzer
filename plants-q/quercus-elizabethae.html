                    <h1>Quercus elizabethae</h1>
<p>Quercus elizabethae, commonly known as Elizabeth's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with deeply lobed, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus elizabethae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
