                    <h1>Quercus toza var. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Quercus toza var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered oak, is a variant of the toza oak native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The flowers are small and clustered, with sessile (stemless) flowers that distinguish this variety from others in the species. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical toza oak.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ecological role and is often found in montane forests.</p>
