                    <h1>Quercus margaretta var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Quercus margaretta var. stolonifera, commonly known as the Margaret's oak variant, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, where horizontal stems root at the nodes to form dense colonies. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a hairy cupule.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
