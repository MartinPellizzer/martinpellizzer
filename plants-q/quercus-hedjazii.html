                    <h1>Quercus hedjazii</h1>
<p>Quercus hedjazii, commonly known as the Hedjaz oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the local flora.</p>
