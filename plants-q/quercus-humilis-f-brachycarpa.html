                    <h1>Quercus humilis f. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Quercus humilis f. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf California oak, is a shrub-like form of the coast live oak.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal areas of California and Baja California, characterized by its small, rounded leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate urban conditions.</p>
