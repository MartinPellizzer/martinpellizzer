<p>Qualea melinonii, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of slow-moving rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>Qualea melinonii plays an important role in the ecological balance of its wetland habitats.</p>
