                    <h1>Quercus boissieri var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Quercus boissieri var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid landscapes.</p>
