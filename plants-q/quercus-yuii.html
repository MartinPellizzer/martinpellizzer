<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing habit. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a rough, textured surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring.</p>
