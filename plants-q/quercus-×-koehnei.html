                    <h1>Quercus × koehnei</h1>
<p>Quercus × koehnei, commonly known as the Koehne's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessilifolia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering, which helps protect the seeds from herbivores. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Quercus × koehnei make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications.</p>
