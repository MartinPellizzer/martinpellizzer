                    <h1>Quercus variabilis</h1>
<p>Quercus variabilis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that change color with the seasons. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, cup-shaped fruits containing one or two edible nuts. Its bark is thick, fissured, and dark gray, providing structural support and protection.</p>
<p>Quercus variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
