                    <h1>Quercus × ermolenkoi</h1>
<p>Quercus × ermolenkoi, commonly known as the Ermolenko oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
