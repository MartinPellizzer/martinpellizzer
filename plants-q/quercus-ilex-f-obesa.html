                    <h1>Quercus ilex f. obesa</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex f. obesa, commonly known as the fat-leaf holm oak, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a natural variant of the holm oak (Quercus ilex) characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and thick, leathery leaves. The leaves are typically broader and more rounded than those of the standard holm oak, giving the plant a fuller appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage, it is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
