<p>Quercus sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-creased leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough, textured upper surface. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered with dense, short hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Quercus sinuata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and mammals.</p>
