<p>Quercus dilatata var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan white oak, is a variant of the broad-leaved oak native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale gray bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
