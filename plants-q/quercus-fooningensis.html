<p>Quercus fooningensis, commonly known as the Fooning oak, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The tree is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, scaly cap.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus fooningensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
