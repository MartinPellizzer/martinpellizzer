                    <h1>Quercus ilex var. dolichocalyx</h1>
<p>Quercus ilex var. dolichocalyx, commonly known as the longleaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a hairy cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments.</p>
