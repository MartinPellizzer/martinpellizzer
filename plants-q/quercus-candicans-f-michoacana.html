                    <h1>Quercus candicans f. michoacana</h1>
<p>Quercus candicans f. michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the evergreen oak found primarily in the state of Michoac√°n, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at moderate elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
