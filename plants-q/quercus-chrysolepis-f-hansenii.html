                    <h1>Quercus chrysolepis f. hansenii</h1>
<p>Quercus chrysolepis f. hansenii, commonly known as the golden chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coast live oak.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its striking golden to reddish-brown leaves, which contrast sharply with its generally grayish-bark. It is typically found in the coastal regions of California, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, often growing in dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
