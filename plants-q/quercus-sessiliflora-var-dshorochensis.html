<p>Quercus sessiliflora var. dshorochensis, commonly known as the Dshorochensk oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairless and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
