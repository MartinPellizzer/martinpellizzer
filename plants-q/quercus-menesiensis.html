                    <h1>Quercus menesiensis</h1>
<p>Quercus menesiensis, commonly known as the Men√©ndez oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
