                    <h1>Quercus crassilamellata</h1>
<p>Quercus crassilamellata, commonly known as the broad-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its wood is hard and durable.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
