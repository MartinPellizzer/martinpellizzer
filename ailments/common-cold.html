                <h1>common cold</h1><h2>intro</h2><p>The common cold is a highly contagious viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide, causing symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and coughing. It is typically caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, which spread through the air when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, or through direct contact with contaminated surfaces. While there is no cure for the common cold, symptoms can be relieved with over-the-counter medications, plenty of rest, and a balanced diet to help the body recover and fight off the infection.</p>
