                    <h1>Allergy</h1>
<p>Allergy is a chronic medical condition characterized by an overreaction of the immune system to specific substances, such as pollen, dust, or certain foods, which triggers the release of histamine and other chemical mediators, leading to various symptoms like itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Medicinal herbs can effectively treat allergies due to their anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, and immunomodulatory properties.</p>
<p>Examples of medicinal herbs that can help alleviate allergy symptoms include butterbur, which has anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties, and nettle leaf, which is rich in antioxidants and has been traditionally used to treat allergic rhinitis.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations, such as nettle leaf infusions, butterbur tinctures, and quercetin supplements, can be used to treat allergies, providing a natural and effective alternative to conventional medications.</p>

<h2 id="0">What is allergy?</h2>
<p>Allergy is a chronic condition in which the body's immune system overreacts to a foreign substance, such as a food, pollen, dust, or insect stings, causing an abnormal response.</p>
<p>This overreaction triggers the release of chemical mediators, leading to a range of common symptoms, including hives, itching, swelling, redness, congestion, coughing, sneezing, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>If left untreated, allergies can have severe negative effects on the body, such as increased risk of anaphylaxis, chronic inflammation, and damage to organs and tissues.</p>
<p>Untreated allergies can significantly impact daily life, causing missed work or school, social isolation, and a reduced quality of life, as individuals may need to avoid certain environments, foods, or activities altogether.</p>

<h2 id="1">Causes</h2>
<p>Allergy is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, caused by an overactive immune response to various substances.</p>
<p>Common causes of allergies include airborne particles such as pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds, dust mites, mold, and pet dander, as well as food allergens like peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat.</p>
<p>Additionally, allergies can be triggered by insect stings, latex, and certain medications, such as antibiotics and anesthetics, while some people may also experience allergic reactions to certain metals like nickel and gold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, certain environmental factors, like exposure to secondhand smoke and air pollution, can also contribute to the development of an allergy.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbs</h2>
<p>Allergy is treated with herbs such as Nettle leaf, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce symptoms of hay fever and itchy skin.</p>
<p>Turmeric root contains curcumin, a compound that inhibits the release of histamine, a chemical responsible for allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Quercetin, found in herbs like Elderflower and Sage, acts as a natural antihistamine, reducing swelling and itching associated with allergies.</p>
<p>Ginger root and Echinacea also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, helping to alleviate respiratory issues and boost the immune system to fight off allergies.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparations</h2>
<p>Allergy is treated with herbal preparations such as teas, infusions, decoctions, tinctures, salves, and creams, which are used to alleviate symptoms and promote recovery.</p>
<p>Infusions and teas are commonly used to soothe irritated tissues and reduce inflammation, while decoctions and tinctures are often used to target the root cause of the allergy.</p>
<p>Salves and creams are applied topically to provide localized relief and protect affected areas from further irritation.</p>
<p>These herbal preparations help treat allergy by reducing histamine release, calming the immune system, and promoting the body's natural healing processes.</p>
