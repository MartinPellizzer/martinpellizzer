<p>Additionally, consuming carbonated drinks, eating too quickly, and not chewing food properly can also contribute to bloating.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbs</h2>
<p>Bloating is treated with herbs such as ginger, peppermint, and fennel, which have natural anti-inflammatory properties that help to ease digestive discomfort.</p>

<p>Additionally, herbs like dill, caraway seeds, and chamomile have been traditionally used to soothe the digestive system, reducing inflammation and promoting the elimination of gas.</p>
<p>By incorporating these medicinal herbs into one's diet, individuals can experience relief from bloating and other digestive issues, promoting overall gut health and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparations</h2>

<p>These preparations, including teas and infusions, are often consumed as a hot or cold beverage to ease bloating symptoms, while tinctures and infusions can be added to water or taken sublingually to quickly absorb the beneficial compounds.</p>
<p>Decoctions and teas are also used to warm the digestive system and stimulate digestion, helping to break down food and reduce bloating.</p>
