                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are smooth and hairless, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. laevigata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
