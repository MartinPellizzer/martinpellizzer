<p>Festuca pseudoeskia, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca pseudoeskia is well adapted to rocky and alpine soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a landscape plant in cooler climates.</p>
