                    <h1>Ficus gasparriniana var. viridescens</h1>
<p>Ficus gasparriniana var. viridescens, commonly known as the Gasparrini fig or green-veined fig, is a rare and striking variant of the Ficus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent, light green veins that create a striking visual contrast. Native to the island of Socotra, this plant exhibits unique adaptations to its arid environment, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The leaves are often shaped like shields, a feature that is thought to help it withstand strong winds and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly cultivated, it is highly valued by botanists and plant enthusiasts for its unusual appearance and evolutionary significance.</p>
