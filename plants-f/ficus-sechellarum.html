                    <h1>Ficus sechellarum</h1>
<p>Ficus sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Seychelles archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and is protected in its native range.</p>
