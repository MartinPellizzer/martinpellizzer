                    <h1>Flickingeria rabanii</h1>
<p>Flickingeria rabanii, commonly known as the banana orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, banana-like pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flickingeria rabanii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
