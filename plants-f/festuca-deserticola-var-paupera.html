                    <h1>Festuca deserticola var. paupera</h1>
<p>Festuca deserticola var. paupera, commonly known as the desert fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth, with narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays a role in preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
