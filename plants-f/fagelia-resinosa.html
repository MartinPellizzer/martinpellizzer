                    <h1>Fagelia resinosa</h1>
<p>Fagelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous fagelia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and broad,革质 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of resinous fruits. Its ability to exude a sticky resin is a notable botanical feature, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Fagelia resinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
