The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fragariastrum kionaeum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
