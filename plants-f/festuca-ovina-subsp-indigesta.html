<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>indigesta, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, and it is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its coarser texture and lower nutritional value compared to other fescue species, making it less preferred for forage but valuable for erosion control.</p>
