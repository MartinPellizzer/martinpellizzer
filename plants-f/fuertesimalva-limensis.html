                    <h1>Fuertesimalva limensis</h1>
<p>Fuertesimalva limensis, commonly known as the Limón fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Limón, Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
