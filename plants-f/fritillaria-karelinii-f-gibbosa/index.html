<p>Fritillaria karelinii f. gibbosa is a rare and striking plant native to the high mountains of Central Asia. It is a variant of the common Fritillaria karelinii, known for its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts.
