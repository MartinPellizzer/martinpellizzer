                    <h1>Fimbristylis triflora</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-flowered clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis triflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate contaminated soils.</p>
