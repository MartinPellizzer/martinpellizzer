                    <h1>Festuca argaea</h1>
<p>Festuca argaea, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Festuca argaea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
