                    <h1>Festuca sulcata subvar. wagneri</h1>
<p>Festuca sulcata subvar. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which remains upright throughout the growing season. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable forage grass in dryland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to spread and form dense, persistent stands.</p>
