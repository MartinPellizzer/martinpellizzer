<p>Fatoua aspera, commonly known as the rough fatoua, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Fatoua aspera is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
