                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. barbulata</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. barbulata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a low-maintenance ornamental grass.</p>
