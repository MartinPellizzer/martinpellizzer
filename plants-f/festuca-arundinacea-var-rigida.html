                    <h1>Festuca arundinacea var. rigida</h1>
<p>Festuca arundinacea var. rigida, commonly known as rigid creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it effective for erosion control.</p>
