<p>Festuca glauca f. pubiculmis, commonly known as bluegrass with pubescent leaves, is a variant of the bluegrass species characterized by its distinctive silver-blue foliage.</p>
<p>It is a cool-season grass that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which is a result of dense pubescence covering the leaf surfaces. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
