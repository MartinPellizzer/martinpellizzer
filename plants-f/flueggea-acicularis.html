                    <h1>Flueggea acicularis</h1>
<p>Flueggea acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf flueggea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Flueggea acicularis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
