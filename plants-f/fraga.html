                    <h1>Fraga</h1>
<p>Fraga, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as true strawberries. Fraga thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in coastal areas and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
