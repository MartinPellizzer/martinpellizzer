<p>Fragaria pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-leaf strawberry, is a rare and little-known species of the strawberry genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, differing from the red berries of more common strawberry varieties. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with runners that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
