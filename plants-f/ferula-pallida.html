                    <h1>Ferula pallida</h1>
<p>Ferula pallida, commonly known as the pale ferula, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ferula pallida is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions.</p>
