                    <h1>Festuca platyphylla</h1>
<p>Festuca platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>Festuca platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid habitats.</p>
