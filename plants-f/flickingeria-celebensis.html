<p>Flickingeria celebensis, commonly known as the Celebes cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, dioecious plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic feature of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
