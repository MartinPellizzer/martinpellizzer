                    <h1>Feuilleea altissima</h1>
<p>Feuilleea altissima, commonly known as the Skyleaf Plant, is a tall, herbaceous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Feuilleea altissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
