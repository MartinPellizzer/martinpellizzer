                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. semivivipara</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. semivivipara, commonly known as the semi-viviparous sheep's fescue, is a variant of the sheep fescue species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The semi-viviparous form is notable for its ability to produce viable seeds while still retaining some vegetative characteristics, which can enhance its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and pastures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
