                    <h1>Fraxinus americana var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana var. microcarpa, commonly known as the littleleaf ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Fraxinus americana. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
