<p>Fritillaria scandens, commonly known as the climbing fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a climbing habit, with stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supported by tendrils that grasp onto surrounding vegetation. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, and the bulbs are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Fritillaria scandens thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
