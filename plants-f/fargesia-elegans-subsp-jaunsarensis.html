<p>Fargesia elegans subsp.</p>
<p>jaunsarensis, commonly known as the Yunnan bamboo, is a cold-hardy, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, culm-like stems and graceful, arching foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping for its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in cultivation.</p>
