                    <h1>Festuca michiganica</h1>
<p>Festuca michiganica, commonly known as Michigan bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a dense, carpet-like appearance. This perennial plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stolonic growth helps it spread and form a thick sod.</p>
<p>Festuca michiganica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic.</p>
