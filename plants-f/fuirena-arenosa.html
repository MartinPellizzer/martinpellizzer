<p>Fuirena arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial herb that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Fuirena arenosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
