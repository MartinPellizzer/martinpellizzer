                    <h1>Fimbristylis disticha var. kurzii</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis disticha var. kurzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctively narrow, linear shape, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
