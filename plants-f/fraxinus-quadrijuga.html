<p>Fraxinus quadrijuga, commonly known as the winged maple or American winged elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin. The tree has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow but adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
