<p>Ficus muriculata, commonly known as the rubber fig or weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage and its unique, elongated, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in indoor environments.</p>
<p>Ficus muriculata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
