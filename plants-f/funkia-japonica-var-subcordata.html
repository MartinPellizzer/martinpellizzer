<p>Funkia japonica var. subcordata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, lily-like flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to water gardens. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help control erosion and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
