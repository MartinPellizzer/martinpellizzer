                    <h1>Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. microphylla</h1>
<p>Fraxinus angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash or small-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Fraxinus angustifolia.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and landscape design.</p>
