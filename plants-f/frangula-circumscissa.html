<p>Frangula circumscissa, commonly known as the narrowleaf cascara, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds.</p>
