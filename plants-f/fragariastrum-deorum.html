<p>Fragariastrum deorum, commonly known as the celestial strawberry, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the early spring, followed by edible berries that are said to have a unique, slightly sweet and floral flavor. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and the difficulty of cultivating it, Fragariastrum deorum is highly valued in botanical circles.</p>
