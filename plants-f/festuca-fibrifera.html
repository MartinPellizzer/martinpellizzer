<p>Festuca fibrifera, commonly known as the fibrous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca fibrifera is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system.</p>
<p>Its fibrous structure and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for erosion control and livestock forage in its native habitats.</p>
