                    <h1>Flotovia leptacantha</h1>
<p>Flotovia leptacantha, commonly known as the slender-stemmed flotovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pale yellow and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Flotovia leptacantha is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
