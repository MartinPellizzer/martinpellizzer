                    <h1>Ficus callosa</h1>
<p>Ficus callosa, commonly known as the glossy-leaf ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus callosa is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to adapt to indoor conditions.</p>
