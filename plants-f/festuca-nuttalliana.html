<p>Festuca nuttalliana, commonly known as Nuttall's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca nuttalliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
