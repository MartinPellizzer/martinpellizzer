<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in low-maintenance landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense turf.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife.</p>
