                    <h1>Falconera viscosa</h1>
<p>Falconera viscosa, commonly known as the sticky falconer, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a viscous resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>The resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
