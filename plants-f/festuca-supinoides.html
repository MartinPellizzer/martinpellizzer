<p>Festuca supinoides, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Festuca supinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
