                    <h1>Ferocactus latispinus var. recurvus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus latispinus var. recurvus, commonly known as the recurved hedgehog cactus, is a striking desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in thick, recurved spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its unique spine arrangement and growth form compared to other Ferocactus species.</p>
