                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. durissima</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. durissima, commonly known as hard sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
