                    <h1>Ferocactus latispinus var. spiralis</h1>
<p>Ferocactus latispinus var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hedgehog cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in long, spirally arranged spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
