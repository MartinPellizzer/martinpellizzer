<p>Fritillaria albidiflora var. jimunaica, commonly known as the Jimunaic fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive reticulated pattern on the petals. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a spherical bulb. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
