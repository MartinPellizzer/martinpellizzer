<p>Filix-mas augescens var. normalis, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, supporting its rapid growth in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
