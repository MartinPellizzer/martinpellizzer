                    <h1>Festuca gelida</h1>
<p>Festuca gelida, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Festuca gelida plays an important ecological role in tundra ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and habitat for microorganisms.</p>
