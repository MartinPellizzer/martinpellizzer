                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. luteovariegata</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. luteovariegata, commonly known as the golden-leafed European beech, is a varietal form of the European beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow variegation on the leaves, which results from a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll production. The variegated leaves create a visually distinctive appearance, especially in the spring and summer. This variant is typically found in shaded or protected environments where it can thrive without excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>While it is less common than the typical European beech, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks.</p>
