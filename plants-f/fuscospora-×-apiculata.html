                    <h1>Fuscospora × apiculata</h1>
<p>Fuscospora × apiculata, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Fuscospora fusca and Fuscospora apiculata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a mix of traits from both parent species, including a dark, leathery texture and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
