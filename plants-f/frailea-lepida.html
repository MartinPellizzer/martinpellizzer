                    <h1>Frailea lepida</h1>
<p>Frailea lepida, commonly known as the Lepida Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, spiny structure that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in early spring, and are relatively short-lived.</p>
<p>Frailea lepida is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens.</p>
