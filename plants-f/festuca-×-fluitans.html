                    <h1>Festuca × fluitans</h1>
<p>Festuca × fluitans, commonly known as floating fescue, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits unique adaptations for aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to float on the surface of water, with long, slender leaves that help it remain buoyant. The plant typically forms dense mats on the water's surface, which can provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread rapidly, making it an aggressive colonizer in wetlands and ponds.</p>
<p>However, its invasive tendencies can sometimes lead to ecological imbalances in natural water bodies.</p>
