<p>novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brownish in color, with small, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
