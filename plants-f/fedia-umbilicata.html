                    <h1>Fedia umbilicata</h1>
<p>Fedia umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilicated fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including tiny, floating fruits, are adapted for dispersal by water currents.</p>
<p>Fedia umbilicata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
