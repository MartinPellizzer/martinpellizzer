                    <h1>Festuca pseudodura</h1>
<p>Festuca pseudodura, commonly known as the desert brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca pseudodura is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
