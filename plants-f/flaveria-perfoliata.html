                    <h1>Flaveria perfoliata</h1>
<p>Flaveria perfoliata, commonly known as the stemless ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides.</p>
<p>Flaveria perfoliata is noted for its ecological importance as a source of nectar for pollinators and its use in botanical research due to its genetic simplicity.</p>
