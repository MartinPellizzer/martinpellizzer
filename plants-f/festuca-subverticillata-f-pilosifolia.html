                    <h1>Festuca subverticillata f. pilosifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca subverticillata f. pilosifolia, commonly known as the hairy false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
