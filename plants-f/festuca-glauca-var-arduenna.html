                    <h1>Festuca glauca var. arduenna</h1>
<p>Festuca glauca var. arduenna, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
