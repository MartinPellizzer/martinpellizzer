                    <h1>Fimbristylis squarrosa var. esquarrosa</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis squarrosa var. esquarrosa, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its hairy or scaly structures, particularly on the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
