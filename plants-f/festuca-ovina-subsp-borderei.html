<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>borderei, commonly known as the Alpine meadow fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically pinkish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
