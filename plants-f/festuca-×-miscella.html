                    <h1>Festuca × miscella</h1>
<p>Festuca × miscella, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–100 cm and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers. It is highly tolerant of drought, heat, and poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form a dense sod, which helps suppress weeds and prevent erosion.</p>
