                            <h1>Fragaria Collina Var. Rubricaulis</h1>
<p>Alpine strawberry, scientifically known as Fragaria collina var. rubricaulis, is a rare and hardy plant that thrives in high-altitude environments. This diminutive member of the rose family is often found in mountainous regions where few other plants can survive. Despite its small size, it produces tiny, flavorful berries that are prized for their unique taste and nutritional value. Its resilience to cold temperatures makes it a symbol of endurance in harsh climates. The Alpine strawberry is not only a botanical curiosity but also a vital part of alpine ecosystems.</p>
