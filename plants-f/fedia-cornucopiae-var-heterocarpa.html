                    <h1>Fedia cornucopiae var. heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Fedia cornucopiae var. heterocarpa, commonly known as the horned abundance plant, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the horns of a mythical creature, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from pale green to vibrant orange as they mature. Its fruits are highly variable in shape, with some specimens exhibiting a distinct, twisted morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
