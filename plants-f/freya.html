                    <h1>Freya</h1>
<p>Freya, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a rare and delicate plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Freya is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
