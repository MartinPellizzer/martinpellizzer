<p>Fissistigma cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leafed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble the leaves of ash trees, giving it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it produces both pollen and seed cones.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Fissistigma cinerascens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
