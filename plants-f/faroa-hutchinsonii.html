<p>Faroa hutchinsonii, commonly known as the Kauaʻi ʻohiʻa, is a unique member of the Myrtaceae family native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>This shrub or small tree is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of Kauaʻi, often growing in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
