                    <h1>Fadogia leucophloea var. djalonensis</h1>
<p>Fadogia leucophloea var. djalonensis, commonly known as the West African rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rocky habitats of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring showy, spurred flowers that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in association with limestone or granite substrates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
