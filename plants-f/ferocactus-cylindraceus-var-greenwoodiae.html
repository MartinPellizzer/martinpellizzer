<p>Ferocactus cylindraceus var. greenwoodiae, commonly known as the Greenwood's barrel cactus, is a compact, cylindrical cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear white, fluffy spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem to survive prolonged droughts. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived species, often reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique coloration and structural characteristics, making it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
