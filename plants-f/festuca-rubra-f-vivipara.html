                    <h1>Festuca rubra f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow fescue, is a hemicryptophyte plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It produces dense, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is notable for its ability to form adventitious roots and shoots from its stems, a trait that aids in vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
