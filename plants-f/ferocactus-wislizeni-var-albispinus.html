<p>Ferocactus wislizeni var. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
