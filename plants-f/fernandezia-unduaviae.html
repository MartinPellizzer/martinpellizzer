                    <h1>Fernandezia unduaviae</h1>
<p>Fernandezia unduaviae, commonly known as the Unduavia fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia unduaviae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
