                    <h1>Festuca marginata</h1>
<p>Festuca marginata, commonly known as blue grass or coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca marginata is adapted to salty air and wind exposure, making it a common species in coastal dunes and cliff habitats.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
