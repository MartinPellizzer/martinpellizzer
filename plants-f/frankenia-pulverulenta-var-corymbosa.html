                    <h1>Frankenia pulverulenta var. corymbosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia pulverulenta var. corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal conditions and is considered a valuable component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
