<p>Festuca carnuntina, commonly known as the Carpathian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca carnuntina is also used in some traditional agricultural practices due to its hardy nature and forage value.</p>
