<p>White-veined fig, scientifically known as Ficus mollis var. albipila, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. Its leaves are characterized by their pale white veins against a deep green background, creating a unique visual appeal. This species is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities. It thrives in indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. The white-veined fig is a popular choice for those seeking both beauty and functionality in indoor gardening.</p>
