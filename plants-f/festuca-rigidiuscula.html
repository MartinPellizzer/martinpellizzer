                    <h1>Festuca rigidiuscula</h1>
<p>Festuca rigidiuscula, commonly known as rigid dwarf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
