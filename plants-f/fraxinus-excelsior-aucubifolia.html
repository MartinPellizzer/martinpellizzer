                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior aucubifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior aucubifolia, commonly known as the European ash with aucubifolia foliage, is a hybrid or variant of the European ash (Fraxinus excelsior).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, aucubifolia-type leaves that resemble those of the aucuba plant, with a waxy, glossy surface and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage.</p>
