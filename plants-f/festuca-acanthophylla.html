                    <h1>Festuca acanthophylla</h1>
<p>Festuca acanthophylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sharp, pointed tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca acanthophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
