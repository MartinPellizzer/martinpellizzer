The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Frenela gulielmii is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
