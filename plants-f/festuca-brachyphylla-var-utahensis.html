                    <h1>Festuca brachyphylla var. utahensis</h1>
<p>Festuca brachyphylla var. utahensis, commonly known as Utah needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stiff leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
