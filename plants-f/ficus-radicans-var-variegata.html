<p>Ficus radicans var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Fig Vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and striking variegated leaves that feature white and yellow markings. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to climb or cascade makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves.</p>
<p>Regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth.</p>
