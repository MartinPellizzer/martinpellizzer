<p>Frankenia parvula, commonly known as the small-fringed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Frankenia parvula is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
