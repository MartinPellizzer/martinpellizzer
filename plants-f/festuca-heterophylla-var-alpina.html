<p>Festuca heterophylla var. alpina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it forms dense mats that prevent erosion. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca heterophylla var. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
