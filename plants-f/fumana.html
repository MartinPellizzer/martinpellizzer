                    <h1>Fumana</h1>
<p>Fumana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white petals that resemble mist or smoke, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the cooler months, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical name, *Fumana*, reflects its mist-like appearance, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture.</p>
