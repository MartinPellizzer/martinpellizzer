<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>lanuginosa, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is also a valuable plant for wildlife, providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
