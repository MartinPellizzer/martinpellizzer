<p>Frangula purshiana subsp.</p>
<p>ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic frangula, is a shrub native to the western United States. It thrives in nutrient-poor, ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>
<p>The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are aggregate berries that ripen to a deep red color, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
