                    <h1>Ficus virgata var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Ficus virgata var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
