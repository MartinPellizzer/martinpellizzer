                    <h1>Festuca poa var. mutica</h1>
<p>Festuca poa var. mutica, commonly known as the rough meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-bearing branches, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bluish-green and have a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs.</p>
