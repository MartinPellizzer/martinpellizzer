                    <h1>Fargesia pantlingii</h1>
<p>Fargesia pantlingii, commonly known as the silver-foliaged bamboo, is a clump-forming evergreen bamboo native to China.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a silvery-blue hue due to the dense layer of fine hairs on the leaves. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silver-white underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to add texture and color to woodland settings.</p>
