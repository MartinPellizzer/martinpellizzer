<p>Flickingeria appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are often submerged, with small, scale-like leaves along the stems. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are located at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Flickingeria appendiculata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
