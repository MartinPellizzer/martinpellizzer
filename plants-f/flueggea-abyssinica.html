<p>Flueggea abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian flueggea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Flueggea abyssinica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>
