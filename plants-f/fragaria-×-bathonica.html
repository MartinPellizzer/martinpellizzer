                    <h1>Fragaria × bathonica</h1>
<p>Fragaria × bathonica, commonly known as the Bathonian strawberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Fragaria vesca (the woodland strawberry) and Fragaria chiloensis (the Chilean strawberry).</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are white and have five petals, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit.</p>
<p>The berries are generally smaller than those of the common garden strawberry but have a distinct flavor and aroma.</p>
