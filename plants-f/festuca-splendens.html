                    <h1>Festuca splendens</h1>
<p>Festuca splendens, commonly known as the shining fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca splendens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a low, compact mat that is both hardy and drought-tolerant.</p>
