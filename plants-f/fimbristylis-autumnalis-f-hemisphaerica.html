                    <h1>Fimbristylis autumnalis f. hemisphaerica</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis autumnalis f. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the hemispherical sedge, is a variant of the autumn sedge native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, cylindrical growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas or seasonally flooded soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
