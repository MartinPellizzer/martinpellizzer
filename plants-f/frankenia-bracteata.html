                    <h1>Frankenia bracteata</h1>
<p>Frankenia bracteata, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia bracteata is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
