<p>Festuca ophioliticola subsp.</p>
<p>hirtula, commonly known as the hairy mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its subspecies name.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
