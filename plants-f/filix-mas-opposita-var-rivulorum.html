                    <h1>Filix-mas opposita var. rivulorum</h1>
<p>Filix-mas opposita var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread along the ground.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
