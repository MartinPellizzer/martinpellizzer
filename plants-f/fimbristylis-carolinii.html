                    <h1>Fimbristylis carolinii</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis carolinii, commonly known as Carolina sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis carolinii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
