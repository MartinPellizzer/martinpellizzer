<p>Ficus urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and somewhat hazardous to handle due to its irritant properties.</p>
