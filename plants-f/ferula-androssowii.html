<p>Ferula androssowii, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branching stems and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula androssowii is also valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and stems.</p>
