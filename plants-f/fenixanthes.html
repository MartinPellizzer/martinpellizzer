                    <h1>Fenixanthes</h1>
<p>Fenixanthes, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Fenixanthes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
