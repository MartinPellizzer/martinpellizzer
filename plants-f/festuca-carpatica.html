                    <h1>Festuca carpatica</h1>
<p>Festuca carpatica, commonly known as Carpathian bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-blue blades that form dense, mat-like growth, often reaching heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca carpatica is well adapted to rocky, dry, and sunny environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
