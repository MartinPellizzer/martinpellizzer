                    <h1>Frankenia corymbosa var. valdescuamata</h1>
<p>Frankenia corymbosa var. valdescuamata, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to sandy coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
