                    <h1>Ferocactus wislizeni var. herrerae</h1>
<p>Ferocactus wislizeni var. herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are typically short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
