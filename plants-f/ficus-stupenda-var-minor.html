                    <h1>Ficus stupenda var. minor</h1>
<p>Ficus stupenda var. minor, commonly known as the small fig tree or dwarf fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though these are often not cultivated for fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light conditions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both garden and indoor settings.</p>
