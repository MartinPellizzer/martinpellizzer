<p>Festuca scabrella var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
