<p>Filipendula megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant swamp rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that appear in late summer, often mistaken for true flowers due to their prominent appearance. The plant has slender, arching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
