                    <h1>Festuca pseudosulcata</h1>
<p>Festuca pseudosulcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca pseudosulcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf.</p>
