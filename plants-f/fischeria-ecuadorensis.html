<p>Fischeria ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian Fischeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fischeria ecuadorensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
