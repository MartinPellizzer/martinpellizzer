                    <h1>Festuca tenuiflora var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Festuca tenuiflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent fine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy pubescence. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and landscaping projects.</p>
