                    <h1>Festuca nevadensis</h1>
<p>Festuca nevadensis, commonly known as Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly the Sierra Nevada range.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca nevadensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
