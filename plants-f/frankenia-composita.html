                    <h1>Frankenia composita</h1>
<p>Frankenia composita, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to the coastal landscape. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia composita is well adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
