                    <h1>Flotovia synacantha</h1>
<p>Flotovia synacantha, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique desert plant native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiraling, segmented stems that form a helical shape, which helps it maximize sunlight exposure while minimizing water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing transpiration and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Flotovia synacantha is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and visually distinctive member of the cactus family.</p>
