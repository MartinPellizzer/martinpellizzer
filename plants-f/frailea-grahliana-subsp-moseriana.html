<p>Frailea grahliana subsp.</p>
<p>moseriana, commonly known as the Moser's fairy cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
