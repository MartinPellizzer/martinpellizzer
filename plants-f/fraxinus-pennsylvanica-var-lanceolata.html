<p>Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 4â€“8 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in racemes, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing with a pyramidal shape when young.</p>
