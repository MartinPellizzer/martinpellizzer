<p>Festuca liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Festuca liebmannii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats.</p>
