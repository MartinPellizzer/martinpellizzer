                    <h1>Festuca littorea</h1>
<p>Festuca littorea, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the shores of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that stabilize sandy or muddy soils.</p>
<p>Festuca littorea plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
