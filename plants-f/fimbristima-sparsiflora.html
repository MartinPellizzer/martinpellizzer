<p>Fimbristima sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Fimbristima sparsiflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
