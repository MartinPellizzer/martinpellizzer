                    <h1>Fagonia gypsophila</h1>
<p>Fagonia gypsophila, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Fagonia gypsophila is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
