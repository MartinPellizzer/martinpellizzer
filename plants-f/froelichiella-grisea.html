<p>Froelichiella grisea, commonly known as the gray froelichiella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which are borne on slender pedicels and are often surrounded by bracts. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Froelichiella grisea is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
