<p>Festuca ovina f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sheep fescue, is a variant of the sheep fescue species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in open, disturbed soils. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. One of its notable features is the presence of viviparous structures, which allow for the development of offspring before the plant reaches maturity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
