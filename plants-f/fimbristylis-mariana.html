                    <h1>Fimbristylis mariana</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis mariana, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis mariana is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
