<p>Festuca danthonii var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow, slightly compressed, and lack the hairy texture found in other bluegrass varieties.</p>
<p>It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
