                    <h1>Ficus rubiginosa var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Ficus rubiginosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a variant of the rubber fig plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and often lack the hairy texture found in other ficus species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
