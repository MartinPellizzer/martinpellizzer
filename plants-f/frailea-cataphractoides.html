<p>Frailea cataphractoides, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, leafless plant that features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems. The stems are covered in a layer of white, waxy spines, which help protect the plant from herbivores and intense sunlight. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
