<p>Festuca caprina var. irrasa, commonly known as the Irrian sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca caprina var. irrasa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes.</p>
