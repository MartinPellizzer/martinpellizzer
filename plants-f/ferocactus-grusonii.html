<p>Ferocactus grusonii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spines are short and often covered with a whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ferocactus grusonii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
