<p>Festuca minuta, commonly known as dwarf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has fine, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Festuca minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
