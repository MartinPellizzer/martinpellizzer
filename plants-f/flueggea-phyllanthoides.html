<p>Flueggea phyllanthoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Flueggea phyllanthoides is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
