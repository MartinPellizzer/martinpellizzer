                    <h1>Frigidorchis</h1>
<p>Frigidorchis, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and cold-adapted plant species found in high-altitude and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and has a unique ability to survive in harsh, frost-prone environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Frigidorchis is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
