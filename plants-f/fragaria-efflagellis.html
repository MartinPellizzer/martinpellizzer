<p>Fragaria efflagellis, commonly known as the wandering strawberry, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>

The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are white with five petals and are usually short-lived, blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Fragaria efflagellis is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
