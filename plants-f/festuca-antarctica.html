                    <h1>Festuca antarctica</h1>
<p>Festuca antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a resilient grass species native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh conditions, including freezing temperatures, strong winds, and nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fine leaves that help reduce water loss and withstand wind. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, wind-dispersed seeds that enable it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to survive in cold climates, making it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
