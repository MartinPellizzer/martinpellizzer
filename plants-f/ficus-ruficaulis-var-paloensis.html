<p>Ficus ruficaulis var. paloensis, commonly known as the Palo Negro fig, is a tropical plant native to the humid lowlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name, and its broad, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the trunk. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in warm, moist environments and requires partial shade to full sun, depending on the climate.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
