<p>Forasaccus diandrus, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant purple and green veined leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent lip and spurred petals, which are adaptations for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Forasaccus diandrus is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
