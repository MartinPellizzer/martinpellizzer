                    <h1>Festuca potaninii</h1>
<p>Festuca potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which contain the tiny flowering structures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Festuca potaninii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes.</p>
