                    <h1>Fingerhuthia ciliata var. minor</h1>
<p>Fingerhuthia ciliata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser fingerhuthia, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with finely ciliate margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
