<p>Frankenia crispa, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia crispa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
