                    <h1>Ficus gilletii</h1>
<p>Ficus gilletii, commonly known as the desert fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are important for both wildlife and humans. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Ficus gilletii is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun.</p>
