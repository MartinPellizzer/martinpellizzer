                    <h1>Flourensia solitaria</h1>
<p>Flourensia solitaria, commonly known as the desert flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Flourensia solitaria plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals.</p>
