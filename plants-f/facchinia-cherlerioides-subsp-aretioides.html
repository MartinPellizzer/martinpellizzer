<p>Facchinia cherlerioides subsp.</p>
<p>aretioides, commonly known as the Arete leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, typical of succulents.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green or blue-green in color, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically in summer.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
