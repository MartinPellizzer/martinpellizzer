<p>Filix patens var. stipularis, commonly known as the stipe fern, is a variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
