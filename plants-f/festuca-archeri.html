                    <h1>Festuca archeri</h1>
<p>Festuca archeri, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca archeri thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
