<p>Ficus macrophylla subsp.</p>
<p>columnaris, commonly known as the silky fig or columnar ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its columnar shape, which makes it suitable for use in confined spaces such as indoor environments.</p>
