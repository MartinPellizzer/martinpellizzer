<p>Fragaria terrae-novae, commonly known as the Nova Scotia strawberry, is a rare wild strawberry species native to the coastal regions of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in sandy, acidic soils and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
