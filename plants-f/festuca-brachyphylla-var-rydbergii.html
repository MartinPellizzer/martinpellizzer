                    <h1>Festuca brachyphylla var. rydbergii</h1>
<p>Festuca brachyphylla var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with short, rhizomatous stems that help it spread and establish in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and fine texture.</p>
