                    <h1>Festucopsis festucoides</h1>
<p>Festucopsis festucoides, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist to wet environments. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, particularly in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed within the leaf sheaths, making it difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Festucopsis festucoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
