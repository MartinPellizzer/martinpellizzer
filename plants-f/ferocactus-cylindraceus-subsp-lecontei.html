<p>Ferocactus cylindraceus subsp.</p>
<p>lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its spines are typically yellow to brown, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
