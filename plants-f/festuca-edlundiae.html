                    <h1>Festuca edlundiae</h1>
<p>Festuca edlundiae, commonly known as Edlund's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Festuca edlundiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
