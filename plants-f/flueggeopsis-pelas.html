<p>Flueggeopsis pelas, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that enable it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
