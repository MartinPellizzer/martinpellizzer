                    <h1>Ferula capillifolia</h1>
<p>Ferula capillifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-covered stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin in its taproot, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Ferula capillifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
