                    <h1>Festuca glauca var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Festuca glauca var. umbrosa, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-blue foliage due to its fine, hairy leaves that reflect light. The plant produces slender, upright flower spikes in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It is native to regions of Europe and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
