                    <h1>Ferula elegans</h1>
<p>Ferula elegans, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of volatile oils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a fern-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Ferula elegans is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
