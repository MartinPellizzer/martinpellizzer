                    <h1>Freycinetia tannaensis</h1>
<p>Freycinetia tannaensis, commonly known as Tanna screw-pine, is a species of cycad native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant with a thick, woody stem and a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination. Freycinetia tannaensis is often found growing in coastal areas and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
