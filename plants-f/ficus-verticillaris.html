                    <h1>Ficus verticillaris</h1>
<p>Ficus verticillaris, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish-yellow figs, which are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb or trail along surfaces.</p>
<p>Ficus verticillaris is also popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities.</p>
