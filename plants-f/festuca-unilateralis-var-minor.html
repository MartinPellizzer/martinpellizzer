                    <h1>Festuca unilateralis var. minor</h1>
<p>Festuca unilateralis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
