                    <h1>Fitzroya patagonica</h1>
<p>Fitzroya patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian cypress, is a coniferous tree native to the southern Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and dense. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fitzroya patagonica is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
