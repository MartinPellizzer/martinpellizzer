<p>Festuca flaccida, commonly known as the limp fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Festuca flaccida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms.</p>
