<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Festuca rubra subvar. tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
