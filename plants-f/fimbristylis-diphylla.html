                    <h1>Fimbristylis diphylla</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often densely clustered, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous seeds that are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis diphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
