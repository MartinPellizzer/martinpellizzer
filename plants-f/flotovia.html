                    <h1>Flotovia</h1>
<p>Flotovia, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their ability to float on the surface of water, supported by specialized air-filled sacs called bladders. The bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, which the plant then digests for nutrients. Flotovia species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
