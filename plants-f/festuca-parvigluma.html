<p>Festuca parvigluma, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or pale yellow in color. Festuca parvigluma thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
