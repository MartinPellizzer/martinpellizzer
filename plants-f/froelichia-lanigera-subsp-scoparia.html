<p>Froelichia lanigera subsp.</p>
<p>scoparia, commonly known as the woolly froelichia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
