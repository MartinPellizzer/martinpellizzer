                    <h1>Fallopia convolvulus</h1>
<p>Fallopia convolvulus, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a silver-gray underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas.</p>
