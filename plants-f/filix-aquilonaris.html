<p>Filix aquilonaris, commonly known as the northern fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Filix aquilonaris plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
