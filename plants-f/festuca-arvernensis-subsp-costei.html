<p>Festuca arvernensis subsp.</p>
<p>costei, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments.</p>
