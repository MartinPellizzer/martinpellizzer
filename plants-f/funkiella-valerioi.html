                    <h1>Funkiella valerioi</h1>
<p>Funkiella valerioi, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly silhouettes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy. Its botanical features include fleshy, strap-like leaves and a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Funkiella valerioi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
