                    <h1>Fumana scoparia</h1>
<p>Fumana scoparia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are often spine-tipped, providing a defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Fumana scoparia is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a hardy species for xerophytic landscapes.</p>
