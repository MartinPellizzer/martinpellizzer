<p>Festuca ambigua var. penicillata, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
