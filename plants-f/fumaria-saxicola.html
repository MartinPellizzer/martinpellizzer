<p>Fumaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock fumewort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to poor soil conditions and limited water availability. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed habitats, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
