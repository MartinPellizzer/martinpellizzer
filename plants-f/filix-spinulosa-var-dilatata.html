                    <h1>Filix spinulosa var. dilatata</h1>
<p>Filix spinulosa var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It features a central, spore-bearing fertile frond with a unique, tongue-like shape, which is typical of the genus Filix. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are released during the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The varietal form, dilatata, is distinguished by its broader and more spreading fronds compared to the typical species.</p>
