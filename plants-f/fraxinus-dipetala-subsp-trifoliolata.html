<p>Fraxinus dipetala subsp.</p>
<p>trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf ash, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clustered inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
