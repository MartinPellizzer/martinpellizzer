                <h1>Forasaccus distichus</h1>
<p>Forasaccus distichus, commonly known as the two-ranked fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged substrates, while its spore-producing structures are borne on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Forasaccus distichus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
