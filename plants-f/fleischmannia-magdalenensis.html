                    <h1>Fleischmannia magdalenensis</h1>
<p>Fleischmannia magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalena fleischmannia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and has adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water, while its flowers emit a faint fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fleischmannia magdalenensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
