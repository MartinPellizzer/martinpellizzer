                    <h1>Festuca subciliata</h1>
<p>Festuca subciliata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca subciliata is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
