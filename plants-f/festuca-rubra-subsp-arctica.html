<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
