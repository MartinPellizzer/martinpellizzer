                    <h1>Fagonia olivieri var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Fagonia olivieri var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, adding a striking visual contrast to its grey-green foliage. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Fagonia olivieri var. grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
