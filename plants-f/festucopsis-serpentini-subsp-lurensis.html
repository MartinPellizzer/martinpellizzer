<p>Festucopsis serpentini subsp.</p>
<p>lurensis, commonly known as the Serpent's Grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or barren soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species.</p>
