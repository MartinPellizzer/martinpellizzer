                    <h1>Festuca extremiorientalis</h1>
<p>Festuca extremiorientalis, commonly known as Siberian grass or the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca extremiorientalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
