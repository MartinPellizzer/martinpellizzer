                    <h1>Frailea pygmaea var. lilalunula</h1>
<p>Frailea pygmaea var. lilalunula, commonly known as the Moonlight Frosted Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that give it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
