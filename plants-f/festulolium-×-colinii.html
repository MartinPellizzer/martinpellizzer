                    <h1>Festulolium × colinii</h1>
<p>Festulolium × colinii, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Festuca arundinacea and Lolium perenne.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, making it a popular choice for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often used in lawns, sports fields, and erosion control due to its durability and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, because it is sterile, it must be propagated through seed or vegetative methods.</p>
