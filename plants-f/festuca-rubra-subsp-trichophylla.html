<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>trichophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish hues in its foliage, especially under stress or during the growing season.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in rocky or acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and covered with short, stiff hairs, contributing to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is widely used in turfgrass and restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
