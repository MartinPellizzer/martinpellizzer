                    <h1>Fernandezia angusta</h1>
<p>Fernandezia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf fernandezia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or among vegetation in humid microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia angusta is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
