                    <h1>Frailea pygmaea var. dadakii</h1>
<p>Frailea pygmaea var. dadakii, commonly known as the Dadakii fairy cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
