<p>Friesodielsia fornicata, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with bright yellow gemmae (vegetative propagules) surrounded by a rosette-like arrangement of green thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces through spores and is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Friesodielsia fornicata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
