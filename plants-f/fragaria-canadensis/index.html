                            <h1>Fragaria Canadensis</h1>
<p>Fragaria canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian strawberry, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its ability to form dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are prized for their sweet, tangy flavor. These berries are not only delicious but also rich in nutrients and antioxidants. Fragaria canadensis plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
