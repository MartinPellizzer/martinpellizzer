<p>Festuca pseudorubra, commonly known as red false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in rocky or gravelly areas, contributing to the vegetation structure of high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca pseudorubra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
