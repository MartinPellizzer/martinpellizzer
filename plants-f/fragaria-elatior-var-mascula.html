<p>Fragaria elatior var. mascula, commonly known as the male strawberry, is a botanical variant of the strawberry plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct male flowers that lack the typical pistils found in female flowers. This variety is primarily noted for its role in plant pollination rather than fruit production. The plant exhibits typical strawberry morphology, including trifoliate leaves and runners.</p>
<p>However, it is rarely cultivated for its fruit due to the absence of female reproductive structures.</p>
