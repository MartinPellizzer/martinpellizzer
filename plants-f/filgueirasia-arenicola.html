<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Filgueirasia arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
