<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often reddish or yellowish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
