                    <h1>Filago pyramidata var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Filago pyramidata var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic filago, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine, silvery hairs that provide some protection against strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal ecosystems.</p>
