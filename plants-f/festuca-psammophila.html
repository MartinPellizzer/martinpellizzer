The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, demonstrating drought tolerance and resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca psammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna.</p>
