                    <h1>Flueggea monticola</h1>
<p>Flueggea monticola, commonly known as the mountain flueggea, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often shed during periods of drought, allowing the plant to conserve water.</p>
<p>Flueggea monticola is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices.</p>
