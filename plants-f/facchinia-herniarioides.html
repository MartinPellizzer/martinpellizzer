<p>Facchinia herniarioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Facchinia herniarioides is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
