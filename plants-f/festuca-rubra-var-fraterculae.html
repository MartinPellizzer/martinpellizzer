<p>Festuca rubra var. fraterculae, commonly known as the "Rook's grass," is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, wiry leaves that are often reddish in color, especially at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grassy slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
