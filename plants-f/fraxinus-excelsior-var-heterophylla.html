                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in woodland habitats. The leaves of this plant can vary from simple to deeply lobed, depending on the environmental conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and phenotypic diversity.</p>
