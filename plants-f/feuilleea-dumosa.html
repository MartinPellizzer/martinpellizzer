                    <h1>Feuilleea dumosa</h1>
<p>Feuilleea dumosa, commonly known as the spiny leaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its stems are woody and covered in sharp spines, providing a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Feuilleea dumosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
