                    <h1>Fagus fusca var. dubia</h1>
<p>Fagus fusca var. dubia, commonly known as the dwarf beech, is a variant of the American beech that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree or shrub with smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard Fagus fusca, giving it a more compact appearance. It produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind, and it flowers in the spring with inconspicuous, unisexual flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in eastern North America.</p>
