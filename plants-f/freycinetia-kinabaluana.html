                    <h1>Freycinetia kinabaluana</h1>
<p>Freycinetia kinabaluana, commonly known as the Kinabalu freycinetia, is a rare palm-like plant endemic to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in the cool, moist climate of the mountain's upper forest zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
