                    <h1>Fleurya glechomifolia</h1>
<p>Fleurya glechomifolia, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. Small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates.</p>
