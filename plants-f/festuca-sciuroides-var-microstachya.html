                    <h1>Festuca sciuroides var. microstachya</h1>
<p>Festuca sciuroides var. microstachya, commonly known as the dwarf mountain fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
