                    <h1>Flyriella</h1>
<p>Flyriella, commonly known as the fly trap plant, is a genus of carnivorous plants native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique snap traps, which are modified leaves designed to catch and digest insects. The traps are triggered by sensitive hairs that detect the movement of prey. Flyriella species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Their ability to trap and digest small animals is a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
