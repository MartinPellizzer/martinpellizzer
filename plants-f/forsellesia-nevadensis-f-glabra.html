                    <h1>Forsellesia nevadensis f. glabra</h1>
<p>Forsellesia nevadensis f. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf forsellesia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, attracting specific pollinators. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems and compact foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
