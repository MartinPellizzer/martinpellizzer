                    <h1>Festuca bromoides var. tenella</h1>
<p>Festuca bromoides var. tenella, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and landscape borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
