<p>Festuca subuliflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca subuliflora thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
