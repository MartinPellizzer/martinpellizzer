                    <h1>Festuca poluninii</h1>
<p>Festuca poluninii, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca poluninii thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
