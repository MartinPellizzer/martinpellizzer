                    <h1>Fraxinus pallisiae var. horvatii</h1>
<p>Fraxinus pallisiae var. horvatii, commonly known as the Horvat's ash, is a rare variant of the ash tree native to specific regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species.</p>
