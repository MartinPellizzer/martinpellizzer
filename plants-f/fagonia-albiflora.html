                    <h1>Fagonia albiflora</h1>
<p>Fagonia albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its greyish-green foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry climates.</p>
<p>Fagonia albiflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
