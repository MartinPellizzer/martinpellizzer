                    <h1>Festuca psammophila f. affinis</h1>
<p>Festuca psammophila f. affinis, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a grass species characterized by its adaptation to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as dunes and coastal areas, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well-suited to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
