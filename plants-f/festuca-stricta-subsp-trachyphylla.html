<p>Festuca stricta subsp.</p>
<p>trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
