                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. tatrensis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in meadows and mountain pastures, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
