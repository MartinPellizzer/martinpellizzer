                    <h1>Ficus sur</h1>
<p>Ficus sur, commonly known as the rubber fig or Brazil fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ficus sur is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its rubbery sap, which is milky and latex-like, is a distinguishing feature of the species.</p>
