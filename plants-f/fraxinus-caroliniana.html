                    <h1>Fraxinus caroliniana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus caroliniana, commonly known as the pond cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found along the edges of swamps and ponds.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
