                    <h1>Festuca cinerea f. insularis</h1>
<p>Festuca cinerea f. insularis, commonly known as the Islandgray fescue, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Festuca cinerea, distinguished by its unique coloration and ecological adaptations. It is often found in maritime climates, growing on dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important plant for stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
