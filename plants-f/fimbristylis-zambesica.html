<p>Fimbristylis zambesica, commonly known as the Zambesi flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
