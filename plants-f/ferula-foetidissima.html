<p>Ferula foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalk and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ferula foetidissima is also valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating digestive ailments and respiratory conditions.</p>
