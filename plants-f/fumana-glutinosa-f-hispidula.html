                    <h1>Fumana glutinosa f. hispidula</h1>
<p>Fumana glutinosa f. hispidula, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a holarctic plant characterized by its glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“50 cm, with a slender stem and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it is often seen in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and promote the adherence of pollen grains.</p>
