<p>Fleischmannia acuminata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Fleischmannia acuminata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
