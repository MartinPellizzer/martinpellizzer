<p>Ferula sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stem and large, fern-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, capable of storing water to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Ferula sinkiangensis is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
