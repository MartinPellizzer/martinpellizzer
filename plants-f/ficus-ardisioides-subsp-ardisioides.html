<p>Ficus ardisioides subsp.</p>
<p>ardisioides, commonly known as the red-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
