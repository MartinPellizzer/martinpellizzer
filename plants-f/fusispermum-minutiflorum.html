The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
