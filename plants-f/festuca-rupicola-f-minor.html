                    <h1>Festuca rupicola f. minor</h1>
<p>Festuca rupicola f. minor, commonly known as the rock grass or dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
