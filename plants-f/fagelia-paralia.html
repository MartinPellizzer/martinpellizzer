                    <h1>Fagelia paralia</h1>
<p>Fagelia paralia, commonly known as the coastal fagelia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Fagelia paralia is typically found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a unique subject of study in coastal botany.</p>
