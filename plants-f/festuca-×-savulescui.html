<p>Festuca × savulescui, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, typically Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
