<p>Festuca simensis, commonly known as the Simens fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated.
