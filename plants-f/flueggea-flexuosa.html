                    <h1>Flueggea flexuosa</h1>
<p>Flueggea flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible flueggea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, trailing growth habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Flueggea flexuosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
