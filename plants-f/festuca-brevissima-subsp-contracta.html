<p>Festuca brevissima subsp.</p>
<p>contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a groundcover in gardens.</p>
