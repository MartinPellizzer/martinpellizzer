<p>Feuilleea versicolor, commonly known as the Variable Leaf Plant, is a unique species characterized by its ability to change leaf color in response to environmental stimuli.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. The plant's foliage exhibits a range of hues from deep green to vibrant red and purple, depending on light exposure and nutrient levels. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Feuilleea versicolor is also notable for its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
