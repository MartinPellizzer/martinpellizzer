                    <h1>Fraxinus porosa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus porosa, commonly known as the porous ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and distinctive, smooth, light-gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The porous ash is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for furniture and tool handles.</p>
