                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. trojana</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. trojana, commonly known as the Trojana sheep fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, making it well-suited for alpine environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control in rocky or arid soils.</p>
