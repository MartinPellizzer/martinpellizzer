<p>Fraxinus apetala, commonly known as the wingless ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is notable for lacking the winged samaras typical of many ash species. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Fraxinus apetala is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
