                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. retroflexa</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. retroflexa, commonly known as the curled-leaf European beech, is a rare and distinctive form of the European beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tightly curled leaves that give it a striking, almost fern-like appearance. This variation occurs naturally in certain regions of Europe, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant retains the typical structure of the European beech but exhibits a notable morphological difference in leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and genetic uniqueness.</p>
