                    <h1>Fumaria numidica var. muricaria</h1>
<p>Fumaria numidica var. muricaria, commonly known as the rock fumitory, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
