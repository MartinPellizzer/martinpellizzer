                    <h1>Festucaria psilantha</h1>
<p>Festucaria psilantha, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Its root system is dense and fibrous, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Festucaria psilantha plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
