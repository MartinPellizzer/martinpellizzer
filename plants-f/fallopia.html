<p>Fallopia, commonly known as cowhead, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. They are typically found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Some species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Fallopia species are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
