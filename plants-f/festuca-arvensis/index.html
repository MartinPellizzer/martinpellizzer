                            <h1>Festuca Arvensis</h1>
<p>Festuca arvensis is a hardy grass species commonly found in disturbed soils across temperate regions. It thrives in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas due to its adaptability. This plant is known for its fine, tufted growth and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its presence often indicates soil disturbance or poor drainage. Despite its modest appearance, Festuca arvensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
