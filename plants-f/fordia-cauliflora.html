                    <h1>Fordia cauliflora</h1>
<p>Fordia cauliflora, commonly known as the panicleflower, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers emerge directly from the stems rather than the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Fordia cauliflora is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens.</p>
