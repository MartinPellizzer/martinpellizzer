                    <h1>Festuca sulcata f. glaucantha-hirsuta</h1>
<p>Festuca sulcata f. glaucantha-hirsuta, commonly known as the silver-hairy tufted fescue, is a variant of the tall fescue species characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>This grass is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate moisture. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance provide it with a unique aesthetic appeal, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense sod, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for use in lawns, pastures, and restoration projects.</p>
