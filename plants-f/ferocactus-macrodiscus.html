<p>Ferocactus macrodiscus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and prominent areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is often cultivated as a succulent for its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>Ferocactus macrodiscus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and striking addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
