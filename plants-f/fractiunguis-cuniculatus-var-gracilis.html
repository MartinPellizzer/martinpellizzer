<p>Fractiunguis cuniculatus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender rabbit-footed plant, is a succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble rabbit feet, which are adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
