<p>Fevillea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and have a feathery appearance, making it an attractive addition to shaded gardens.</p>
