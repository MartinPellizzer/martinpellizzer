<p>Festuca supina subsp.</p>
<p>vivipara, commonly known as the creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features tufted, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
