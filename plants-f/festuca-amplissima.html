                    <h1>Festuca amplissima</h1>
<p>Festuca amplissima, commonly known as the giant fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Festuca amplissima is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, long-lasting sods, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
