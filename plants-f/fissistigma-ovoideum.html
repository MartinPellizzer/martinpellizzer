                    <h1>Fissistigma ovoideum</h1>
<p>Fissistigma ovoideum, commonly known as the oval-egg mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees such as eucalypts and acacias.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed through the droppings of these birds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Fissistigma ovoideum is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a warm, temperate climate.</p>
