<p>Festuca plebeia, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Festuca plebeia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
