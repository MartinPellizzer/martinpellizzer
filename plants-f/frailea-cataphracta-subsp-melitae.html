<p>Frailea cataphracta subsp.</p>
<p>melitae, commonly known as the Maltese cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Mediterranean island of Malta. It features a globular stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
