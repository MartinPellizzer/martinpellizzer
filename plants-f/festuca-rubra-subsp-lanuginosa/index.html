                            <h1>Festuca Rubra Subsp. Lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Lush fescue, scientifically known as Festuca rubra subsp. lanuginosa, is a hardy grass species that thrives in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly found in temperate regions, often growing in meadows, lawns, and along coastal areas. This plant is valued for its dense growth habit and ability to withstand foot traffic, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its fine, velvety leaves give it a soft appearance, while its tufted growth pattern adds visual interest to the landscape. Lush fescue plays an important role in soil stabilization and supports local wildlife by providing habitat and food.</p>
