                    <h1>Fagelia verticillata</h1>
<p>Fagelia verticillata, commonly known as the spiralwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling growth pattern, where its stems twist in a helical manner, giving it a visually striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, Fagelia verticillata is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
