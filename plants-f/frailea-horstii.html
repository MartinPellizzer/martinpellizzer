                    <h1>Frailea horstii</h1>
<p>Frailea horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, bluish-green surface that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bright orange fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
