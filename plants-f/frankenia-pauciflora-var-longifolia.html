                    <h1>Frankenia pauciflora var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Frankenia pauciflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
