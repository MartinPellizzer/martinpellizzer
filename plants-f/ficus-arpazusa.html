The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, inedible berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus arpazusa is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
