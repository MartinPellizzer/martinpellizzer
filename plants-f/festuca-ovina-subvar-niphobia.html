                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. niphobia</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. niphobia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold and windy environments. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its dense root system aids in soil stabilization and prevents erosion in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh habitats.</p>
