                    <h1>Festuca triticoides</h1>
<p>Festuca triticoides, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Festuca triticoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
