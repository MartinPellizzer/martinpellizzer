                    <h1>Ficus guttata</h1>
<p>Ficus guttata, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus guttata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
