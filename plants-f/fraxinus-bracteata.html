<p>Fraxinus bracteata, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and compound leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are samaras, or winged seeds, that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees.</p>
