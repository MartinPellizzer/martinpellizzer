                    <h1>Ficaria calthifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Ficaria calthifolia var. major, commonly known as the greater ficaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
