<p>Festuca ovina var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white sheep fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina var. ochroleuca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments.</p>
