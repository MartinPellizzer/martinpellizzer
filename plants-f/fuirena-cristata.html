<p>Fuirena cristata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and makes it useful for land reclamation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Fuirena cristata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
