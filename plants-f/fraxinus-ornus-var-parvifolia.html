                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, grey-barked branches and lance-shaped leaves that are smaller and more finely toothed compared to the typical ash. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
