                            <h1>Festuca Rubra Subsp. Fraterculae</h1>
<p>Red fescue, scientifically known as Festuca rubra subsp. fraterculae, is a low-growing grass species native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. This plant is notable for its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, which make it a valuable component of natural ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, red fescue plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its resilience and adaptability have made it a subject of interest for both ecological studies and horticultural applications.</p>
