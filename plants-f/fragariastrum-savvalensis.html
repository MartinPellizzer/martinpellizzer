                    <h1>Fragariastrum savvalensis</h1>
<p>Fragariastrum savvalensis, commonly known as the Savval's strawberry, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble those of the common strawberry, though they are typically smaller and have a distinct flavor profile. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
