                    <h1>Faidherbia albida var. pseudoglabra</h1>
<p>Faidherbia albida var. pseudoglabra, commonly known as the African mahogany or leadwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and arid soils. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that turn reddish during the dry season.</p>
<p>The wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important for local communities and traditional uses.</p>
