                    <h1>Fordiophyton strictum</h1>
<p>Fordiophyton strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for stems. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, growing in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in ecological systems where it interacts with its host plants.</p>
