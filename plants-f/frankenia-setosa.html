                    <h1>Frankenia setosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia setosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in sandy soils. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained environments, making it a common sight along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs that provide protection against wind and salt spray.</p>
<p>Frankenia setosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>
