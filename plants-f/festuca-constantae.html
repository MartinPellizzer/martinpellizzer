<p>Festuca constantae, commonly known as Constant's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Festuca constantae is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
