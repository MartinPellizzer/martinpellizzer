                    <h1>Fistularia serotina</h1>
<p>Fistularia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering pipefish, is a marine angelfish belonging to the family Callionymidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like body and a distinctive, elongated snout that resembles a pipe. This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, inhabiting coral reefs and seagrass beds. Its coloration is usually a mix of yellow, orange, and red, with intricate patterns that provide camouflage in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant, however, is not a true plant but a marine fish, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense.</p>
