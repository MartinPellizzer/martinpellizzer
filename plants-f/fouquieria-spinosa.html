                    <h1>Fouquieria spinosa</h1>
<p>Fouquieria spinosa, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to shed leaves during droughts, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper underground, enhancing its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Fouquieria spinosa is also notable for its rapid growth and regeneration after disturbances like fires or droughts.</p>
