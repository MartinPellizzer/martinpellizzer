                    <h1>Frankenia pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Frankenia pulverulenta, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Frankenia pulverulenta is well adapted to harsh, coastal environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
