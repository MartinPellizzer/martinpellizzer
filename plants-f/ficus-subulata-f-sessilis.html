                    <h1>Ficus subulata f. sessilis</h1>
<p>Ficus subulata f. sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fig or dwarf fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pointed, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round figs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
