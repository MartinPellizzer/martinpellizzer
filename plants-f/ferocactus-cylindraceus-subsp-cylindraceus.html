<p>Ferocactus cylindraceus subsp.</p>
<p>cylindraceus, commonly known as the cylindrical barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
