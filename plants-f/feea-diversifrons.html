                    <h1>Feea diversifrons</h1>
<p>Feea diversifrons, commonly known as the variable frond fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a wide variation in shape and size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
