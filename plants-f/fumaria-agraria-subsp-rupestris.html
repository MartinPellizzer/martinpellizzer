<p>Fumaria agraria subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rock fumewort, is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh conditions. It is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor substrates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in challenging, open landscapes.</p>
