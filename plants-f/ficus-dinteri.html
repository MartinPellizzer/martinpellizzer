                    <h1>Ficus dinteri</h1>
<p>Ficus dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's fig, is a rare and distinctive species native to the arid regions of Namibia and southwestern Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature essential for survival in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a unique inflorescence called a syconium. Its fruit, a small, green fig, is edible and serves as a food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ficus dinteri is considered an endangered species.</p>
