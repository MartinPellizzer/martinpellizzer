<p>Fusifilum spirale, commonly known as the spiral filum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its helical growth pattern.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems that twist in a spiral around a central axis, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are small and scale-like, often arranged in a tight spiral along the stem.</p>
<p>Fusifilum spirale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
