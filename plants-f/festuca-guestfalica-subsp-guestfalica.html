<p>Festuca guestfalica subsp.</p>
<p>guestfalica, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
