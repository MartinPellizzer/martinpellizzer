                    <h1>Ferocactus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Ferocactus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue ferocactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically blue-green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its bluish-green foliage. Ferocactus glaucescens is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide shade and protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry landscapes.</p>
