                    <h1>Fritillaria liliacea</h1>
<p>Fritillaria liliacea, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange, red, or yellow, arranged in a crown-like cluster at the top of the stem. The plant features a thick, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Fritillaria liliacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
