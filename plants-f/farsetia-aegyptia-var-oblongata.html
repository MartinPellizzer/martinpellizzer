<p>Farsetia aegyptia var. oblongata, commonly known as the Egyptian farsetia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-maintenance gardening.</p>
