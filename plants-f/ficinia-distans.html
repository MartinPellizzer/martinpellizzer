                    <h1>Ficinia distans</h1>
<p>Ficinia distans, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a flowering plant native to wetland and swampy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>Ficinia distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
