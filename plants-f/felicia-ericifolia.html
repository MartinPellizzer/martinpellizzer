<p>Felicia ericifolia, commonly known as the woolly felicia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both drought-tolerant and visually appealing.</p>
