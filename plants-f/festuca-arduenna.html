                    <h1>Festuca arduenna</h1>
<p>Festuca arduenna, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca arduenna is typically found in alpine meadows and slopes, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
