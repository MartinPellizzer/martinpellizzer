                    <h1>Festuca alpina var. intercedens</h1>
<p>Festuca alpina var. intercedens, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in rocky or arid landscapes.</p>
