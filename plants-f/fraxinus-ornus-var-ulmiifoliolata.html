                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus var. ulmiifoliolata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus var. ulmiifoliolata, commonly known as the winged spindle or winged ash, is a variant of the common ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that are broader and more elongated than those of the typical Fraxinus ornus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
