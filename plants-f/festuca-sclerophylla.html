<p>Festuca sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca sclerophylla is well adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration and landscaping in rocky or poor soils.</p>
