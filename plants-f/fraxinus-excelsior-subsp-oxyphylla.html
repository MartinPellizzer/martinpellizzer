<p>Fraxinus excelsior subsp.</p>
<p>oxyphylla, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a subspecies of the common ash native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking orange-red in autumn. The fruit is a small, two-valved samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
