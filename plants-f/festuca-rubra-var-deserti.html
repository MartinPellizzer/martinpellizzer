                    <h1>Festuca rubra var. deserti</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra var. deserti, commonly known as desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
