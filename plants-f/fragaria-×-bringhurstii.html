                    <h1>Fragaria × bringhurstii</h1>
<p>Fragaria × bringhurstii, commonly known as the Bringhurst strawberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the wild woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and the garden strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic berries that are typically red when ripe, though some cultivars may produce yellow or white fruits. The plant has a compact growth habit with trifoliate leaves and produces runners, allowing it to spread and establish new plants. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and edible cultivation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant genetics and horticulture.</p>
