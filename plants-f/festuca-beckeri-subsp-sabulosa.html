<p>Festuca beckeri subsp.</p>
<p>sabulosa, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a low-maintenance ornamental grass.</p>
