<p>Fraxinus pulverulenta, commonly known as the ash tree, is a species of flowering plant in the olive family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. The bark of Fraxinus pulverulenta is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
