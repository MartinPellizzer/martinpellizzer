                    <h1>Fritillaria foliosa</h1>
<p>Fritillaria foliosa, commonly known as the leafy fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with a distinctive black or dark purple pattern. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions and bloom reliably each year.</p>
<p>Fritillaria foliosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
