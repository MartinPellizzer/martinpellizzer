                    <h1>Ferula moschata</h1>
<p>Ferula moschata, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its strong, aromatic odor, which is primarily due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depths, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Ferula moschata has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
