                    <h1>Festuca pratensis f. parvillora</h1>
<p>Festuca pratensis f. parvillora, commonly known as the small-leaved meadow fescue, is a horticulturally important grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, dense foliage.</p>
<p>This botanical variant exhibits smaller leaf blades and shorter internodes compared to the typical form of Festuca pratensis, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense, weed-resistant turf.</p>
<p>Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest in plant breeding and ecological studies.</p>
