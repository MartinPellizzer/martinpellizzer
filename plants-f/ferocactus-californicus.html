<p>Ferocactus californicus, commonly known as the California barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are followed by spiny, red fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Ferocactus californicus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and scrublands.</p>
