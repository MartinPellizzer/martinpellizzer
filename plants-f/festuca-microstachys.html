                    <h1>Festuca microstachys</h1>
<p>Festuca microstachys, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with fine, blue-green foliage that is highly ornamental. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in native plant gardens and erosion control.</p>
