<p>Festuca reptans, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage and has slender, wiry stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Festuca reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
