<p>Ficus cumingii var. worcesteri, commonly known as the Worcester fig, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and horticultural appeal, it is often cultivated in greenhouse settings.</p>
