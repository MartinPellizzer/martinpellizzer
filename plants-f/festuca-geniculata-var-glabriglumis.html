                    <h1>Festuca geniculata var. glabriglumis</h1>
<p>Festuca geniculata var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the glabrous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a smooth, glabrous surface.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
