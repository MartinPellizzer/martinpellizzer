<p>Forcipella bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Forcipella bosseri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
