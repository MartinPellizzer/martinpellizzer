<p>Fraxinus floribunda subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island ash, is a rare subspecies native to specific island habitats in the western Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or island forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
