<p>Faramea warmingiana, commonly known as the African mahogany or red mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries.
