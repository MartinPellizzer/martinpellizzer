<p>Festuca duriuscula var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are thick and leathery, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a useful plant for erosion control and landscaping in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and sustainable gardening practices.</p>
