                    <h1>Falkia canescens</h1>
<p>Falkia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf falkia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Falkia canescens is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
