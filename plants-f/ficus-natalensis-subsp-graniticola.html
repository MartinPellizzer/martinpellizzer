<p>Ficus natalensis subsp.</p>
<p>graniticola, commonly known as the granite fig, is a species of fig tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal.</p>
