                    <h1>Ficus septica var. cauliflora</h1>
<p>Ficus septica var. cauliflora, commonly known as the cauli-flowered fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, making it visually distinct from other ficus species. Its leaves are typically thick, glossy, and heart-shaped, providing a lush appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
