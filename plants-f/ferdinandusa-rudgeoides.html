                    <h1>Ferdinandusa rudgeoides</h1>
<p>Ferdinandusa rudgeoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
