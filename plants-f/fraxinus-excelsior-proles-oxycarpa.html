                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior proles oxycarpa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior proles oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by elongated, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to ash dieback, a serious fungal disease that has impacted ash populations across Europe.</p>
