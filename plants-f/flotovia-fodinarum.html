<p>Flotovia fodinarum, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in slow-moving or still water bodies, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often reduced to small, thread-like structures, while the bladders are the primary means of capturing prey.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
