                    <h1>Fraxinus concolor</h1>
<p>Fraxinus concolor, commonly known as the western white fir, is a coniferous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical crown that becomes more irregular with age. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are needle-like, typically 1 to 2 inches long, and are arranged spirally along the branches.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-white when young, developing shallow fissures as the tree matures.</p>
