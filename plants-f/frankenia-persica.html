                    <h1>Frankenia persica</h1>
<p>Frankenia persica, commonly known as Persian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry inland regions.</p>
<p>Frankenia persica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique foliage.</p>
