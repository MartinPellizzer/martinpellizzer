                    <h1>Fosterella robertreadii</h1>
<p>Fosterella robertreadii, commonly known as the Florida pineapple cactus, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, pineapple-scented fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
