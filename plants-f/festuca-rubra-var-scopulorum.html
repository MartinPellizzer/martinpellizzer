<p>Festuca rubra var. scopulorum, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, tolerating cold, wind, and poor soil.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky and mountainous regions.</p>
