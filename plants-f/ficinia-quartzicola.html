                    <h1>Ficinia quartzicola</h1>
<p>Ficinia quartzicola, commonly known as the quartzleaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
