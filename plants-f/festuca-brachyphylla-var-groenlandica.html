                    <h1>Festuca brachyphylla var. groenlandica</h1>
<p>Festuca brachyphylla var. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant has short, dense foliage and forms a dense mat, which helps prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly resilient to extreme temperatures and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
