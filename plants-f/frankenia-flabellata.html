<p>Frankenia flabellata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, succulent stems and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Frankenia flabellata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
