<p>Frankenia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often on limestone or gypsum substrates, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Frankenia gypsophila is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
