                    <h1>Festuca rubra var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra var. vivipara, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both sterile and fertile florets, with the latter containing three stamens and a single pistil. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions and is often found in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
