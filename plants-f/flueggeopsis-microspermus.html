                    <h1>Flueggeopsis microspermus</h1>
<p>Flueggeopsis microspermus, commonly known as the small-seeded flueggeopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces tiny, spherical seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule, which is a unique feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
