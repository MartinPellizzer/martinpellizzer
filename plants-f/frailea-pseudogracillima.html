<p>Frailea pseudogracillima, commonly known as the slender rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant features pale green to bluish-green spiny stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Frailea pseudogracillima is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
