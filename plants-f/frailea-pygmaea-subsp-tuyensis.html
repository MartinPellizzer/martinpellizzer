<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>tuyensis, commonly known as the Tuyensis Porcupine Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Ecuador. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with dense, spiny areoles covered in white, woolly hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
