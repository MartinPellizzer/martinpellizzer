                    <h1>Fagelia grisebachii</h1>
<p>Fagelia grisebachii, commonly known as the Grisebach's fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many diverse and often toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique floral structures that resemble cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia grisebachii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
