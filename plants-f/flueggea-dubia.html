<p>Flueggea dubia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Flueggea dubia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
