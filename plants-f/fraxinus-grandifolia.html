                    <h1>Fraxinus grandifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often larger than those of other ash species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its root system is relatively shallow, making it susceptible to windthrow, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Fraxinus grandifolia plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
