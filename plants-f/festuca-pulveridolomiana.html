                    <h1>Festuca pulveridolomiana</h1>
<p>Festuca pulveridolomiana, commonly known as the Dolomite Festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Dolomites in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
