                            <h1>Festuca Lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Soft brome, scientifically known as Festuca lanuginosa, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and tufted growth habit, making it a common sight in meadows and disturbed soils. This plant is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its ability to thrive in poor conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects. Despite its unassuming nature, soft brome is a resilient and valuable member of grassland ecosystems.</p>
