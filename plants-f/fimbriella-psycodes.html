                    <h1>Fimbriella psycodes</h1>
<p>Fimbriella psycodes, commonly known as the lace lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, finely branched thallus with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant's symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria enables it to photosynthesize and thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
