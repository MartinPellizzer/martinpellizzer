<p>Fragaria vesca monstr.</p>
<p>pinnata, commonly known as the showy strawberry, is a rare and striking variant of the common strawberry. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance, distinguishing it from typical strawberries.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often more flavorful than those of the common species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a prized specimen among botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
