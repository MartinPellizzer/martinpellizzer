<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale to reddish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the vegetation structure and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Clarke's red fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in harsh environments.</p>
