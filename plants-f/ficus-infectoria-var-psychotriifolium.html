                    <h1>Ficus infectoria var. psychotriifolium</h1>
<p>Ficus infectoria var. psychotriifolium, commonly known as the sacred fig or psychoactive fig, is a species of fig tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs. The plant contains psychoactive compounds, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contribute to its hallucinogenic effects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is often used in traditional rituals and has gained attention for its potential in ethnobotanical research.</p>
