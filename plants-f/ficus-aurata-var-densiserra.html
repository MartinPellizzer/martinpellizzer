<p>Ficus aurata var. densiserra, commonly known as the dense serrated ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, ovate leaves with prominent, serrated margins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its dense foliage and compact growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation.</p>
