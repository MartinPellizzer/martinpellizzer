                    <h1>Fimbristylis tristachya var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis tristachya var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to saline and brackish conditions makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects.</p>
