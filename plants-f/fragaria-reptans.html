                    <h1>Fragaria reptans</h1>
<p>Fragaria reptans, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet than those of the common strawberry. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with runners that spread across the ground, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
