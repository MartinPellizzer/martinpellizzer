                    <h1>Festuca vallicola</h1>
<p>Festuca vallicola, commonly known as the valley fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca vallicola is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy member of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and forage for various alpine organisms.</p>
