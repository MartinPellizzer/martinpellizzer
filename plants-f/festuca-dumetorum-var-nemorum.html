                    <h1>Festuca dumetorum var. nemorum</h1>
<p>Festuca dumetorum var. nemorum, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories.</p>
