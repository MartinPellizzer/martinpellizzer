                    <h1>Fimbristylis squarrosa var. robustior</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis squarrosa var. robustior, commonly known as the robust hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its robust growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
