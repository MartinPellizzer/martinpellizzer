                            <h1>Festuca Ovina F. Lemanii</h1>
<p>Lemman's sheep's fescue, scientifically known as Festuca ovina f. lemanii, is a rare and delicate grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This unique variant of sheep's fescue is distinguished by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a standout in alpine environments. Found primarily in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited geographic range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its beauty and ecological significance have made it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
