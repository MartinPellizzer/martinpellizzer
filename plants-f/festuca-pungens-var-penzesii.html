                    <h1>Festuca pungens var. penzesii</h1>
<p>Festuca pungens var. penzesii, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage, which results from its fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with dry, rocky conditions.</p>
