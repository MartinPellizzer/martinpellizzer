                    <h1>Festuca oreophila</h1>
<p>Festuca oreophila, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca oreophila thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
