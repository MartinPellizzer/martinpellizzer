                    <h1>Festuca ciliata</h1>
<p>Festuca ciliata, commonly known as silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and a dense, tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered with fine hairs, giving it a silky texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer.</p>
<p>Festuca ciliata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
