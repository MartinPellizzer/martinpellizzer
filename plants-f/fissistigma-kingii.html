<p>Fissistigma kingii, commonly known as the King's fissistigma, is a rare and striking member of the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fissistigma kingii is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
