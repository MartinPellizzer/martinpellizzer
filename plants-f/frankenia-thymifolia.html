<p>Frankenia thymifolia, commonly known as coastal bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Frankenia thymifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
