<p>Frangula rubra, commonly known as roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. Frangula rubra is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It has been used historically for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds in its bark and leaves.</p>
