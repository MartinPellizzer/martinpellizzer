<p>Fagara mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at higher elevations, often in rainforest environments. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagara mauiensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
