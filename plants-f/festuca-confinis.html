                    <h1>Festuca confinis</h1>
<p>Festuca confinis, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca confinis is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh climatic conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of mountain ecosystems.</p>
