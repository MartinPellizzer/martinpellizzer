                    <h1>Festuca durandoi var. capillifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca durandoi var. capillifolia, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
