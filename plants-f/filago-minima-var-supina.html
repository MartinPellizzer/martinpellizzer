<p>Filago minima var. supina, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with numerous small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, terminal heads, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
