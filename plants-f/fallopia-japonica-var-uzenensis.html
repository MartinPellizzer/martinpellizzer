                    <h1>Fallopia japonica var. uzenensis</h1>
<p>Fallopia japonica var. uzenensis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features stout, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown and covered in small, translucent, waxy dots. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly wavy texture, and they turn red in the fall.</p>
