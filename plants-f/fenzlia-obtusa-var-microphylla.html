<p>Fenzlia obtusa var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf fenzlia, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
