                    <h1>Festuca nubigena var. longiaristata</h1>
<p>Festuca nubigena var. longiaristata, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant typically forms dense mats, with slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and mountainous soils, making it a common component of alpine vegetation.</p>
