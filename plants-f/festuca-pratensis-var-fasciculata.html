<p>Festuca pratensis var. fasciculata, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming a thick turf.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in lawns and sports fields due to its durability and fine texture.</p>
