                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. pyrogea</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. pyrogea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-blue foliage that thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine soils, often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments.</p>
