                    <h1>Fraxinus platycarpa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark brown color. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is less commonly used than other ash species.</p>
<p>The plant has limited horticultural use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
