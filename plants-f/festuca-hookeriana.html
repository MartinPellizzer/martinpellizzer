                    <h1>Festuca hookeriana</h1>
<p>Festuca hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca hookeriana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions.</p>
