                    <h1>Fraxinus velutina var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Fraxinus velutina var. coriacea, commonly known as the Arizona ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite and have a velvety texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The Arizona ash is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of urban conditions and its ability to provide shade.</p>
