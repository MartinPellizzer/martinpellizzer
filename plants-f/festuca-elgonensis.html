                    <h1>Festuca elgonensis</h1>
<p>Festuca elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ecological significance, Festuca elgonensis is often used in restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
