                    <h1>Fuirena hispida</h1>
<p>Fuirena hispida, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Fuirena hispida is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
