                    <h1>Ficus stolonifera</h1>
<p>Ficus stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by white, fuzzy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>This adaptability makes it a popular choice for ground cover in warm climates.</p>
