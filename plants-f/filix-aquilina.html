                    <h1>Filix aquilina</h1>
<p>Filix aquilina, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Filix aquilina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
