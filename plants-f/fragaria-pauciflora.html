                    <h1>Fragaria pauciflora</h1>
<p>Fragaria pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and less flavorful compared to common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
