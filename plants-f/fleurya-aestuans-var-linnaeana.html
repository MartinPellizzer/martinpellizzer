                    <h1>Fleurya aestuans var. linnaeana</h1>
<p>Fleurya aestuans var. linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean fleurya, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its attractive, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense, rounded spikes. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and floating, contributing to its aquatic habitat adaptation.</p>
<p>The species is named in honor of Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, reflecting its historical significance in botanical classification.</p>
