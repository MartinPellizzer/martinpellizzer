                    <h1>Fumaria alba</h1>
<p>Fumaria alba, commonly known as white smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, mildly toxic alkaloid called fumarine, which gives it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Fumaria alba is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties.</p>
