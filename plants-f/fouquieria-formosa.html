                    <h1>Fouquieria formosa</h1>
<p>Fouquieria formosa, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, candle-like stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy bark. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and shed during drought periods, allowing the plant to conserve water.</p>
<p>Fouquieria formosa is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife.</p>
