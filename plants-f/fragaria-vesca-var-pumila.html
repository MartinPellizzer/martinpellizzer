                    <h1>Fragaria vesca var. pumila</h1>
<p>Fragaria vesca var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with runners that spread along the ground, allowing it to colonize rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it is well adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edibility, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings.</p>
