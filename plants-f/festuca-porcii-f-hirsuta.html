                    <h1>Festuca porcii f. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Festuca porcii f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a variant of the species Festuca porcii, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage.</p>
<p>This grass is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in preventing erosion.</p>
