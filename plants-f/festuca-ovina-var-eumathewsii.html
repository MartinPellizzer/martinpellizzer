<p>Festuca ovina var. eumathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle structure. This variety is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded landscapes.</p>
