                    <h1>Fagelia trifida</h1>
<p>Fagelia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed fagelia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three deeply lobed leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Fagelia trifida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
