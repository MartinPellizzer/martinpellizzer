<p>Festuca arundinacea var. fasciculata, commonly known as creeping red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural and landscaped environments.</p>
