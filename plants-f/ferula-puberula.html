<p>Ferula puberula, commonly known as the woolly ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, woody stem and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ferula puberula is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
