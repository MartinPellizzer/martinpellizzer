<p>Frailea alacriportana, commonly known as the Alacriportana Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems, which are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
