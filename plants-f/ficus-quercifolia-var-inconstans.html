                    <h1>Ficus quercifolia var. inconstans</h1>
<p>Ficus quercifolia var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable-leaf fig, is a variant of the Ficus quercifolia species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can range from oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variability, making it a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
