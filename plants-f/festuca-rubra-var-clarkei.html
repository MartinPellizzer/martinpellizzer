<p>Festuca rubra var. clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense, dark green foliage with a bluish tint. The plant typically forms a compact mat, with slender, wiry stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late summer, and it is well adapted to dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Clarke's red fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes.</p>
