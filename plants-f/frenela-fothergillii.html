                    <h1>Frenela fothergillii</h1>
<p>Frenela fothergillii, commonly known as the Fothergill's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It has small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Frenela fothergillii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
