                    <h1>Ficus warburgii</h1>
<p>Ficus warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg fig or the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by a pear-shaped, greenish fruit that turns yellow when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties.</p>
<p>The plant's roots can develop aerial roots, which help it anchor to surfaces in its natural habitat.</p>
