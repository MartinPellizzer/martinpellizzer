                    <h1>Flickingeria nodosa</h1>
<p>Flickingeria nodosa, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structures that often form dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Flickingeria nodosa thrives in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture directly through its surface.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ability to colonize nutrient-poor substrates make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
