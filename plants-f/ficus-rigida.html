                    <h1>Ficus rigida</h1>
<p>Ficus rigida, commonly known as the rigid fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Ficus rigida is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties.</p>
<p>Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
