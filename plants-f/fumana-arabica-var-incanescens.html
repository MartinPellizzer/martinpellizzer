<p>Fumana arabica var. incanescens, commonly known as the white arabica coffee plant, is a variant of the widely cultivated *Coffea arabica* species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of standard arabica varieties. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and consistent temperatures, typically between 18°C and 24°C. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in panicles, and it produces red, fleshy berries containing two seeds used for coffee production.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and specialized variety within the coffee family.</p>
