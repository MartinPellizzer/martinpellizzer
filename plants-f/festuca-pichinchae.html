                    <h1>Festuca pichinchae</h1>
<p>Festuca pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
