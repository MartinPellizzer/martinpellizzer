                    <h1>Fragaria nubicola</h1>
<p>Fragaria nubicola, commonly known as the highland strawberry, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces small, delicate flowers with five white petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its fruits are small, red, and aromatic, similar in appearance to the common strawberry but with a more intense flavor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
