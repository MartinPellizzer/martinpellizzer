<p>Festuca parviflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca parviflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
