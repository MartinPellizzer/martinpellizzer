<p>Festuca arundinacea var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican grass, is a variant of the tall fescue species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green, often bluish-gray leaves. The plant typically forms dense, sod-like turf and is adapted to a wide range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
