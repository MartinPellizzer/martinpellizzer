                    <h1>Frankenia laevis</h1>
<p>Frankenia laevis, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Frankenia laevis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
