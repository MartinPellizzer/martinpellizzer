<p>Ficus luschnathiana, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or orange when ripe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Ficus luschnathiana is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of latex.</p>
