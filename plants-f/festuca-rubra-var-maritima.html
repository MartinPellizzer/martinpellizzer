<p>Festuca rubra var. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal meadows. Its ability to tolerate wind, salt spray, and frequent inundation makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Festuca rubra var. maritima plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
