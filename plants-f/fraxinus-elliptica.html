<p>Fraxinus elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet, featuring a narrow, conical shape with a straight trunk.

Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendulous clusters in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
