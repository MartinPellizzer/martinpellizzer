                    <h1>Ferocactus stainesii var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus stainesii var. pilosus, commonly known as the Staines' barrel cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively rare and is often found growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls.</p>
