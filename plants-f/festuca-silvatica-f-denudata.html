                    <h1>Festuca silvatica f. denudata</h1>
<p>Festuca silvatica f. denudata, commonly known as the naked woodland fescue, is a rare and delicate grass species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species.</p>
