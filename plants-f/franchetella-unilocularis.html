<p>Franchetella unilocularis, commonly known as the single-chambered bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are specialized for capturing prey, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also obtaining nutrients through prey digestion.</p>
