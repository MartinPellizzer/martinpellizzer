                    <h1>Ficus subulata var. ancolana</h1>
<p>Ficus subulata var. ancolana, commonly known as the silver ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that are not typically consumed by humans.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is its primary appeal.</p>
