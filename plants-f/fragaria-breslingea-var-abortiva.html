                    <h1>Fragaria breslingea var. abortiva</h1>
<p>Fragaria breslingea var. abortiva, commonly known as the Bresling's strawberry variant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered fruits that resemble strawberries but are typically smaller and less developed. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying wild strawberry species.</p>
