                    <h1>Fendlera rupicola var. falcata</h1>
<p>Fendlera rupicola var. falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fendlera, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are often branched and covered in a powdery coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and prevent desiccation.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
