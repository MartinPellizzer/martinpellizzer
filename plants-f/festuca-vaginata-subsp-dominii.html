<p>Festuca vaginata subsp.</p>
<p>dominii, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
