                    <h1>Festuca filiformis</h1>
<p>Festuca filiformis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tussocks and is often found in rocky or barren soils. Festuca filiformis is adapted to low light conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and tundra ecosystems.</p>
