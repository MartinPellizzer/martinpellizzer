                    <h1>Fallugia paradoxa</h1>
<p>Fallugia paradoxa, commonly known as the brittleblow or smooth bladderpod, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Fallugia paradoxa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
