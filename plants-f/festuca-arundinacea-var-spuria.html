                    <h1>Festuca arundinacea var. spuria</h1>
<p>Festuca arundinacea var. spuria, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
