<p>Flourensia heterolepis, commonly known as the desert daisies, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant has a sprawling, shrub-like growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Flourensia heterolepis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
