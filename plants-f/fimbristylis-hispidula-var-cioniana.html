                    <h1>Fimbristylis hispidula var. cioniana</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis hispidula var. cioniana, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>The hairy sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
