                    <h1>Folliculigera procumbens</h1>
<p>Folliculigera procumbens, commonly known as the creeping follicular orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that form a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its often humid and shaded habitats.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle, a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>
