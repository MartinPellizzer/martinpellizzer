                    <h1>Folomfis fragilis</h1>
<p>Folomfis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle leaf fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, light green fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its rapid growth and fragile foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is sensitive to temperature changes and requires careful maintenance to flourish.</p>
