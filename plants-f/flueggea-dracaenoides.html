                    <h1>Flueggea dracaenoides</h1>
<p>Flueggea dracaenoides, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling a dragon's tail, hence its common name. The plant has a succulent, tree-like stem with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
