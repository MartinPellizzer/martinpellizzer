<p>Fernandezia hamiltonii var. hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically丛生 (clumped) in growth. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are borne on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
