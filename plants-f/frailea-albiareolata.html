<p>Frailea albiareolata, commonly known as the White-areola Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its white, prominent areoles that contrast with the green stem tissue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Frailea albiareolata is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight.</p>
