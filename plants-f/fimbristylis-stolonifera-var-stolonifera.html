                    <h1>Fimbristylis stolonifera var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis stolonifera var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a fibrous texture, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
