                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. gracilior</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. gracilior, commonly known as slender mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. gracilior plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
