                    <h1>Festuca lasiantha</h1>
<p>Festuca lasiantha, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca lasiantha is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it a notable component of high-elevation plant communities.</p>
