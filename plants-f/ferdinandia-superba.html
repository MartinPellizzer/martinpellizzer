                <h1>Ferdinandia superba</h1>
<p>Ferdinandia superba, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy over the water. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its stems float on the surface.</p>
<p>Ferdinandia superba plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shade for aquatic life.</p>
