                    <h1>Festuca nemorosa</h1>
<p>Festuca nemorosa, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca nemorosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
