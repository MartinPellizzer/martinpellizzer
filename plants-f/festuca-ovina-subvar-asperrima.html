                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. asperrima</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. asperrima, commonly known as rough sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. asperrima is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along disturbed sites such as roadsides and railway embankments.</p>
