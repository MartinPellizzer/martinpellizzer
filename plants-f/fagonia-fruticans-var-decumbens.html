                    <h1>Fagonia fruticans var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Fagonia fruticans var. decumbens, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
