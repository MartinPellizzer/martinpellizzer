<p>Filix-mas × boottii, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Filix mas* (the common male fern) and *Boottia* species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive central rachis and branching pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
