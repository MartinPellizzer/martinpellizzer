                    <h1>Frappieria littoralis</h1>
<p>Frappieria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal frappier, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the northern Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often forming dense mats along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in the harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Frappieria littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
