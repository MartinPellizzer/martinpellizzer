                    <h1>Fagus antarctica var. palustris</h1>
<p>Fagus antarctica var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp birch, is a variant of the Antarctic birch native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in swampy or boggy habitats. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, rounded cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to cold climates and plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
