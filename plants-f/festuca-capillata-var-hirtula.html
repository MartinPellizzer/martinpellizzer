                    <h1>Festuca capillata var. hirtula</h1>
<p>Festuca capillata var. hirtula, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. This variety is particularly adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive, cohesive turf, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with glumes that are hairy and often longer than the lemma.</p>
