                    <h1>Ficaria verna var. bulbifera</h1>
<p>Ficaria verna var. bulbifera, commonly known as the winter cress or bulbous winter cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, green capsules that contain the seeds. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce bulb-like structures called bulbils, which can develop into new plants.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its survival and spread in disturbed or moist environments.</p>
