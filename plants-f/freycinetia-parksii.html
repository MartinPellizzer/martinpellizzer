<p>Freycinetia parksii, commonly known as the Pohnpei cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid tropical climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
