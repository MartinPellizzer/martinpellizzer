                    <h1>Festuca psammophila f. illigii</h1>
<p>Festuca psammophila f. illigii, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats, where it plays a vital role in ecological succession.</p>
