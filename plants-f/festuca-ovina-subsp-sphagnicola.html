<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, moist environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
