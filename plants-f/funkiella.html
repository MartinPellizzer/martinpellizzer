                    <h1>Funkiella</h1>
<p>Funkiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, and often translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
