<p>Ficus homblei, commonly known as the Hombli fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus homblei is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments.</p>
