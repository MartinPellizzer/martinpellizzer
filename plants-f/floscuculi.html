                    <h1>Floscuculi</h1>
<p>Floscuculi, commonly known as the "flower of the moon," is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, misty forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a trait attributed to specialized chloroplasts containing unique photophoric compounds. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude environment. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon phase, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Floscuculi remains a subject of scientific curiosity due to its limited distribution and poorly understood reproductive mechanisms.</p>
