<p>Ficinia elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
