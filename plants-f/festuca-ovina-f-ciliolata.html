<p>Festuca ovina f. ciliolata, commonly known as the hairy sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive hairy margins, which give it its specific epithet "ciliolata.". It is a cool-season grass that is drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth and ability to form a lush, green carpet.</p>
