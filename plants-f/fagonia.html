                    <h1>Fagonia</h1>
<p>Fagonia, commonly known as desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Fagonia species are native to dry regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They produce small, yellow flowers that are often followed by edible, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its adaptability to harsh, semi-desert conditions and its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
