<p>Ferocactus flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its greenish-yellow body. Its spines are typically short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Ferocactus flavovirens is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems.</p>
