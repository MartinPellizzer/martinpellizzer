                    <h1>Fleischmannia bohlmanniana</h1>
<p>Fleischmannia bohlmanniana, commonly known as the Bohlmann's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, toxic berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested.</p>
