                    <h1>Ficus mima</h1>
<p>Ficus mima, commonly known as the miniature fig, is a small, slow-growing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into edible figs, though the fruit is not typically cultivated for consumption. Ficus mima thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
