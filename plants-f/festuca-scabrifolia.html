                    <h1>Festuca scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in early summer. Festuca scabrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
