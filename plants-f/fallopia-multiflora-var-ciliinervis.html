                    <h1>Fallopia multiflora var. ciliinervis</h1>
<p>Fallopia multiflora var. ciliinervis, commonly known as the smoothleaf Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features robust, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown in color and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy underside, and have a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other species of Fallopia due to its similar morphology and rapid growth habit.</p>
