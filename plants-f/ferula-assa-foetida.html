                    <h1>Ferula assa-foetida</h1>
<p>Ferula assa-foetida, commonly known as the devil's dung or stinking garlic, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which is harvested from the roots and has a strong, unpleasant odor. This gum is used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
