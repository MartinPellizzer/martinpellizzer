                    <h1>Festuca altaica</h1>
<p>Festuca altaica, commonly known as Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically pale blue to purple in color. Festuca altaica is well-suited for rocky or sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions makes it a resilient choice for ecological restoration projects.</p>
