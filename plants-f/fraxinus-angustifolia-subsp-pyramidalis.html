<p>Fraxinus angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a subspecies native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal growth habit and its finely toothed, elliptical leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other ash species.</p>
