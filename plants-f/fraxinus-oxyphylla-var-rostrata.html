                    <h1>Fraxinus oxyphylla var. rostrata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus oxyphylla var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Fraxinus oxyphylla. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by samaroid fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
