                    <h1>Festuca sulcata f. subrupicola</h1>
<p>Festuca sulcata f. subrupicola, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a compact grass species characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and exhibits a low maintenance requirement, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically reddish in color, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant.</p>
