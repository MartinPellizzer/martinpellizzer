<p>Fragariopsis scandens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a climbing or trailing habit, often forming dense mats on the ground or along surfaces. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Fragariopsis scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover.</p>
