                    <h1>Fimbristylis stenochlaena</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis stenochlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens.</p>
