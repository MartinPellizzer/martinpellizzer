                    <h1>Frumentum arenarium</h1>
<p>Frumentum arenarium, commonly known as the sand millet, is a small annual grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It produces small, cylindrical grains that are adapted to thrive in sandy soils with low moisture. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water. Its seeds are often used as a traditional food source in some parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Frumentum arenarium make it well-suited for cultivation in drought-prone environments.</p>
