<p>Ficus edulis var. elliptica, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into large, round fruits resembling bread. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green and firm, as it ripens quickly once it begins to change color.</p>
<p>It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a starchy texture similar to bread when cooked.</p>
