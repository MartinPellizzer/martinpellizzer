                    <h1>Festuca myuros var. subnuda</h1>
<p>Festuca myuros var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked false brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairless stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically lack the tufts of hair found in other Festuca species.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in challenging conditions.</p>
