<p>Festuca inopoda, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca inopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
