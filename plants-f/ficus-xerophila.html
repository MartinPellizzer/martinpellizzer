<p>Ficus xerophila, commonly known as the desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from a wide area.</p>
<p>Ficus xerophila is well adapted to hot, sunny environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
