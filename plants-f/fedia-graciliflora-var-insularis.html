The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or mountainous regions with high humidity. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
