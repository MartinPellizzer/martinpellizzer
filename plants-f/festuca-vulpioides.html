<p>Festuca vulpioides, commonly known as fox tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, fox-like appearance due to its dense, tufted inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and sandy soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca vulpioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
