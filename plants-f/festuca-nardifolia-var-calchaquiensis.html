                    <h1>Festuca nardifolia var. calchaquiensis</h1>
<p>Festuca nardifolia var. calchaquiensis, commonly known as the Calchaqui sedge, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
