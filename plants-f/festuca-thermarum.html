                    <h1>Festuca thermarum</h1>
<p>Festuca thermarum, commonly known as the thermal fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the hot springs regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils. This plant is adapted to high-temperature environments, often growing around geothermal areas where water temperatures are elevated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in such unique habitats.</p>
<p>Festuca thermarum is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its specialized adaptations to extreme thermal conditions.</p>
