                    <h1>Ficus desertorum</h1>
<p>Ficus desertorum, commonly known as the desert fig, is a small shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically red or purple when ripe. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ficus desertorum is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
