                    <h1>Festuca tibetica</h1>
<p>Festuca tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Festuca tibetica is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
