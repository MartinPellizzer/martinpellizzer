                    <h1>Ficus gibbosa f. parasitica</h1>
<p>Ficus gibbosa f. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic fig, is a hemi-parasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root structures that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, fleshy figs that serve as a food source for various insects and animals. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms symbiotic relationships with its hosts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying parasitic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
