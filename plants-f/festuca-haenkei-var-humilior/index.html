                            <h1>Festuca Haenkei Var. Humilior</h1>
<p>Festuca haenkei var. humilior is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and high-altitude environments where few plants can survive. Its fine, silver-green leaves give it a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover. Despite its hardiness, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish.</p>
