<p>Fritillaria tristis, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red, orange, or yellow, arranged in a crown-like cluster at the top of a tall stem. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Fritillaria tristis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a cut flower.</p>
