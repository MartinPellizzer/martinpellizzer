                    <h1>Festuca reptatrix</h1>
<p>Festuca reptatrix, commonly known as匍匐剪股颖, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland floors where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Festuca reptatrix is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
