                    <h1>Fraxinus velutina var. papillosa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus velutina var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and adaptability to arid conditions.</p>
