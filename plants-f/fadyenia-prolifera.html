                    <h1>Fadyenia prolifera</h1>
<p>Fadyenia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and clustered in spikes, while its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Fadyenia prolifera plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
