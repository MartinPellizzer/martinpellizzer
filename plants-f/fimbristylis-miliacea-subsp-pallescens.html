<p>Fimbristylis miliacea subsp.</p>
<p>pallescens, commonly known as the pale leaching sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
