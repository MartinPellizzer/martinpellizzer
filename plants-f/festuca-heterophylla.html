                    <h1>Festuca heterophylla</h1>
<p>Festuca heterophylla, commonly known as silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Festuca heterophylla is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
