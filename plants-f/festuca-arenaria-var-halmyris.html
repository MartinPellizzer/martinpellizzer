                    <h1>Festuca arenaria var. halmyris</h1>
<p>Festuca arenaria var. halmyris, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
