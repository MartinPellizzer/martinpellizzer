<p>Festuca psammophila subsp.</p>
<p>dominii, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it an important component of stabilizing sandy environments.</p>
