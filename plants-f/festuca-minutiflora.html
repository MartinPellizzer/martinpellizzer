                    <h1>Festuca minutiflora</h1>
<p>Festuca minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Festuca minutiflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil structure.</p>
