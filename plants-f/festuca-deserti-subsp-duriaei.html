<p>Festuca deserti subsp.</p>
<p>duriaei, commonly known as desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in desert scrub and sandy soils across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
