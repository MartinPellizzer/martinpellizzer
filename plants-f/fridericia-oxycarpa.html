<p>Fridericia oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-fruited fridericia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its distinctive, elongated, and sharply pointed fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are dry and dehiscent, splitting open to release seeds, which is a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Fridericia oxycarpa is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
