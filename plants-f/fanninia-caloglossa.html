<p>Fanninia caloglossa, commonly known as the small red alga, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodomelaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth form and vibrant red coloration, which is typical of many red algae species. The plant thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow, warm waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its structure consists of branching filaments that form a dense mat, and it reproduces through the release of motile zoospores.</p>
<p>Fanninia caloglossa plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
