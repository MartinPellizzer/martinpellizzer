                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. inops</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. inops, commonly known as the slender sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and serving as forage for grazing animals.</p>
