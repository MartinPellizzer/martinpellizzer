                    <h1>Festuca asperula</h1>
<p>Festuca asperula, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Festuca asperula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
