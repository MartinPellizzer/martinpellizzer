                    <h1>Fuirena tuwensis</h1>
<p>Fuirena tuwensis, commonly known as the Tuwensian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Fuirena tuwensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
