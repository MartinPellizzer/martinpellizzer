<p>Franseria incana, commonly known as the silverleaf franseria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Franseria incana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
