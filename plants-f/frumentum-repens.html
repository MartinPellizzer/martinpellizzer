                    <h1>Frumentum repens</h1>
<p>Frumentum repens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth, grassy texture.</p>
<p>Frumentum repens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
