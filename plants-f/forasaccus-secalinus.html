<p>Forasaccus secalinus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and rivers.</p>
