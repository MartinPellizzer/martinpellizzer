                    <h1>Festuca linigluma</h1>
<p>Festuca linigluma, commonly known as blue wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of high concentrations of chlorophyll and other pigments. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca linigluma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
