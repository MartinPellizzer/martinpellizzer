                    <h1>Fraxinus oregona f. pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Fraxinus oregona f. pulverulenta, commonly known as the Oregon ash var. pulverulenta, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Oregon ash.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, almost powdery bark, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It features compound leaves with slender, serrated leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>This form is less common in cultivation due to its specific habitat requirements and limited geographic range.</p>
