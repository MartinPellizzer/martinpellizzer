<p>Festuca dracomontana, commonly known as dragon mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
