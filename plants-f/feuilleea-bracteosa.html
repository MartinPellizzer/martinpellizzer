                    <h1>Feuilleea bracteosa</h1>
<p>Feuilleea bracteosa, commonly known as the leafy bract plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its bract-like leaves are modified to serve as protective structures for the flowering stems.</p>
<p>Feuilleea bracteosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
