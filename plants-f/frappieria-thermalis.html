                    <h1>Frappieria thermalis</h1>
<p>Frappieria thermalis, commonly known as the thermal fern, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to extreme thermal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in geothermal areas with high temperatures and mineral-rich soils, often found near hot springs and volcanic regions. The plant exhibits unique morphological adaptations, such as thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid, heat-stressed conditions. Its reproductive structures are modified to ensure successful pollination in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Frappieria thermalis is considered a valuable indicator species for geothermal ecosystems.</p>
