                    <h1>Funkia marginata</h1>
<p>Funkia marginata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
