                    <h1>Ferocactus wislizeni var. flalconeri</h1>
<p>Ferocactus wislizeni var. flalconeri, commonly known as the flalconeri barrel cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, ribbed structure helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly noted for its robust growth and ability to withstand extreme temperatures and drought.</p>
