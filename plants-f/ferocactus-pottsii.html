                    <h1>Ferocactus pottsii</h1>
<p>Ferocactus pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ferocactus pottsii is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
