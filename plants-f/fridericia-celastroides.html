<p>Fridericia celastroides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides a source of food for certain insects and birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Fridericia celastroides plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host plants and wildlife.</p>
