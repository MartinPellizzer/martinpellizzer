<p>Fallugia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
