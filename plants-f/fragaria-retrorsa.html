<p>Fragaria retrorsa, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than common strawberries. Fragaria retrorsa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural research.</p>
