<p>Ferocactus chrysacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are densely covered with sharp, yellow spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
