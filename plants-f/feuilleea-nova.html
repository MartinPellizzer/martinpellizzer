                    <h1>Feuilleea nova</h1>
<p>Feuilleea nova, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and lavender, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
