                    <h1>Ficus umbrae</h1>
<p>Ficus umbrae, commonly known as the shadow fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, providing dense shade beneath the canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by inedible, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid environments with high levels of indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
