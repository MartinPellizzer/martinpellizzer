<p>Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. profunda, also known as the deep-rooted sweetgum, is a unique variant of the sweetgum tree native to the southeastern united states. it is characterized by its deep and extensive root system, which allows it to thrive in challenging soil conditions. this plant is often found in wetland areas and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. despite its hardiness, it faces threats from environmental changes and invasive species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
