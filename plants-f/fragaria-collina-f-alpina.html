                    <h1>Fragaria collina f. alpina</h1>
<p>Fragaria collina f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a subspecies of the woodland strawberry that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common strawberry. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental or for its edible fruits.</p>
