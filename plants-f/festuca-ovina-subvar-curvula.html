                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. curvula</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often curve at the tips. This subvariety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous and stolonic growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. curvula is also used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
