                    <h1>Festuca lemanii var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Festuca lemanii var. ciliata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has fine, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
