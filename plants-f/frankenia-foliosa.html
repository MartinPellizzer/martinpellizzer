                    <h1>Frankenia foliosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia foliosa, commonly known as coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle splash of color to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia foliosa is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
