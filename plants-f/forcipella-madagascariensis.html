<p>Forcipella madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan clawed frog, is a unique amphibian native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Microhylidae and is characterized by its distinctive claw-like structures on its fingers. The plant, however, is not a botanical entity but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name.</p>
