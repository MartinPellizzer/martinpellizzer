<p>Filaginella uliginosa subsp.</p>
<p>rossica, commonly known as the Russian bog moss, is a rare and specialized bryophyte found in peatland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, often in wet, shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are typically borne on short, erect stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
