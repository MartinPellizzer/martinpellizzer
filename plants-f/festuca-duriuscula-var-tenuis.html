                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. tenuis, commonly known as slender rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
