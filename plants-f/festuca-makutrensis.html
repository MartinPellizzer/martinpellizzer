<p>Festuca makutrensis, commonly known as the Makutrend grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
