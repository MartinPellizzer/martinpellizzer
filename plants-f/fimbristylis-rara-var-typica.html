<p>Fimbristylis rara var. typica, commonly known as the rare tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly fibrous texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
