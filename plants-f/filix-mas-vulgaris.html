The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Filix-mas vulgaris is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
