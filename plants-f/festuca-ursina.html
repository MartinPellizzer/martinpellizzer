                    <h1>Festuca ursina</h1>
<p>Festuca ursina, commonly known as bear grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, releasing lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Festuca ursina is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
