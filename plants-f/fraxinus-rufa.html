<p>Fraxinus rufa, commonly known as the red ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, making it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Fraxinus rufa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplains.</p>
