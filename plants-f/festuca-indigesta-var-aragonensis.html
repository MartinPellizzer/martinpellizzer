                    <h1>Festuca indigesta var. aragonensis</h1>
<p>Festuca indigesta var. aragonensis, commonly known as Aragon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
