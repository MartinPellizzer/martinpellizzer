                            <h1>Fragaria Chiloensis Subsp. Lucida</h1>
<p>Fragaria chiloensis subsp. lucida is a rare and delicate wild strawberry species native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. This subspecies is known for its small, intensely flavored berries that thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing in rocky coastal areas and along the edges of dunes where it withstands harsh environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, it remains under threat from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
