<p>Festuca ovina var. rorida, commonly known as the silvery bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of short, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina var. rorida is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
