                    <h1>Flueggea trichogynis</h1>
<p>Flueggea trichogynis, commonly known as the desert mistletoe, is a parasitic shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is characterized by its small, green leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives its nutrients from its host trees, typically in the genus Prosopis, through specialized structures called haustoria. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
