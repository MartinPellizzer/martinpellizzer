<p>Festuca indigesta subsp.</p>
<p>lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and along the edges of bogs.</p>
<p>Due to its low nutritional value, it is considered less desirable for forage but plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
