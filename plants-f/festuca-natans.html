                    <h1>Festuca natans</h1>
<p>Festuca natans, commonly known as floating fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the ability to form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca natans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
