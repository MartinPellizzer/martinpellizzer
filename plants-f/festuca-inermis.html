                    <h1>Festuca inermis</h1>
<p>Festuca inermis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca inermis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
