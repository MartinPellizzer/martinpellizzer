<p>Facheiroa pilosa, commonly known as the hairy facheiroa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Facheiroa pilosa is often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it contributes to stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
