                    <h1>Fragaria fragarioides</h1>
<p>Fragaria fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible, red berries resembling strawberries but with a more acidic flavor. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Fragaria fragarioides make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions.</p>
