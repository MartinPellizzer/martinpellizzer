                    <h1>Festuca × elongata</h1>
<p>Festuca × elongata, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, coarse leaf blades, and the ability to form dense, sod-forming turf. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread aggressively, forming a thick mat that suppresses weed growth.</p>
<p>However, some ecotypes of tall fescue may contain endophytic fungi that can be toxic to livestock.</p>
