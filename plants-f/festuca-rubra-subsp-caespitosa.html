<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, dark green foliage that is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit helps it form cohesive turf-like patches, enhancing its use in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
