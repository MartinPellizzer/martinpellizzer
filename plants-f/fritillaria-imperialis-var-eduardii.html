<p>Fritillaria imperialis var. eduardii, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, inflated seed capsules that split open to release seeds, a characteristic typical of the Fritillaria genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dramatic appearance, particularly when planted en masse.</p>
