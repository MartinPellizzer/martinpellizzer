<p>Ficus baileyi, commonly known as the red-veined ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus baileyi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
