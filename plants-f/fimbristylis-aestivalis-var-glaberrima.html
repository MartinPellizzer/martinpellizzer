                    <h1>Fimbristylis aestivalis var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis aestivalis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
