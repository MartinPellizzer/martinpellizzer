                    <h1>Fagus × apiculata var. dubia</h1>
<p>Fagus × apiculata var. dubia, commonly known as the hybrid beech, is a rare and naturally occurring variant of the beech genus.</p>
<p>It exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Fagus sylvatica and Fagus grandifolia, resulting in unique morphological traits. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to typical beech species, with a distinctive serrated margin. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained, acidic soils, often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
