                    <h1>Feaea</h1>
<p>Feaea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, lobed leaves. Native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, these plants thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Feaea species are often found in maritime environments, where they are adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value makes them popular in gardens, though they require well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
