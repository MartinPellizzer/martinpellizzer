<p>Festuca indigesta subsp.</p>
<p>litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiereâ€™s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or rocky environments.</p>
