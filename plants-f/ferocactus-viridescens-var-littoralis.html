                    <h1>Ferocactus viridescens var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Ferocactus viridescens var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cholla, is a succulent cactus native to coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations to coastal environments include thick, waxy skin to reduce water loss and resistance to salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
