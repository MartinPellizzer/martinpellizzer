                    <h1>Filago</h1>
<p>Filago, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. After flowering, they produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, similar to those of the true dandelion.</p>
<p>Filago species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
