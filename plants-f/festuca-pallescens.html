                    <h1>Festuca pallescens</h1>
<p>Festuca pallescens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca pallescens thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for herbivores and stabilizing soil in extreme environments.</p>
