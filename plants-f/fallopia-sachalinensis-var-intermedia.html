<p>Fallopia sachalinensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in summer, followed by dark red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and ability to dominate native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ecological impact is significant, making it a challenge for land managers and conservationists.</p>
