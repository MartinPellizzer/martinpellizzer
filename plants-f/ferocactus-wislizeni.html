<p>Ferocactus wislizeni, commonly known as the wislizen's barrel cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its spines are stiff and often white or yellow, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ferocactus wislizeni is a slow-growing plant that can live for several decades, making it a long-lived component of desert ecosystems.</p>
