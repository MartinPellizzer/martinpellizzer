                    <h1>Foeniculum salsum</h1>
<p>Foeniculum salsum, commonly known as sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines. Its seeds are used in culinary applications, similar to those of common fennel.</p>
<p>However, it is less cultivated than its relative, the common fennel, due to its more specific habitat requirements.</p>
