<p>Fimbristylis disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis disticha is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
