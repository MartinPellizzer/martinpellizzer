                    <h1>Frithia</h1>
<p>Frithia, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Frithia is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in dry landscapes.</p>
