<p>Fraxinus greggii var. nummularis, commonly known as the Gregg's ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to limestone soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
