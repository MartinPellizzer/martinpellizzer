<p>Fagonia latifolia var. dubia, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
