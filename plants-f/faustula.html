                    <h1>Faustula</h1>
<p>Faustula, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and tall, unbranched stems bearing clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. Faustula species are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>They are typically herbaceous perennials, though some species may have a woody base.</p>
