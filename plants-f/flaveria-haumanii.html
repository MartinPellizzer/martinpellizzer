<p>Flaveria haumanii, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>Flaveria haumanii is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
