<p>Ferocactus latispinus var. greenwoodiae, commonly known as the Greenwood's hedgehog cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often green to blue-green in color, with a unique, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
