                    <h1>Fragaria vesca f. alba</h1>
<p>Fragaria vesca f. alba, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a botanical variant of the wild strawberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical red-flowered form. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are generally less flavorful than those of the standard Fragaria vesca. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture.</p>
