                    <h1>Festuca mutica</h1>
<p>Festuca mutica, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky soils, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Festuca mutica is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
