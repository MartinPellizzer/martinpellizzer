<p>Fezia, commonly known as the orchid grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Fezia species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of orchids. They are generally herbaceous and can be either annual or perennial, depending on the species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Fezia make them interesting subjects for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
