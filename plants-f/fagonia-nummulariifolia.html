                    <h1>Fagonia nummulariifolia</h1>
<p>Fagonia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Fagonia nummulariifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
