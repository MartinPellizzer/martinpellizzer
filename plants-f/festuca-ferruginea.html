<p>Festuca ferruginea, commonly known as rusty fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a reddish-brown tinge on the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
