<p>Fraxinus platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are usually flat and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The flat-leaf ash is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wooded areas.</p>
