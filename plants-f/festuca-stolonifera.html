                    <h1>Festuca stolonifera</h1>
<p>Festuca stolonifera, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats that are often found in moist to wet environments such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Festuca stolonifera is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
