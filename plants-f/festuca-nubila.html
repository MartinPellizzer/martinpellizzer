                    <h1>Festuca nubila</h1>
<p>Festuca nubila, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca nubila is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a deep root system that helps it withstand cold and poor soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for grazing animals and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
