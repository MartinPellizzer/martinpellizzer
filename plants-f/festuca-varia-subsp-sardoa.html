<p>Festuca varia subsp.</p>
<p>sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
