                    <h1>Festuca casapaltensis</h1>
<p>Festuca casapaltensis, commonly known as Casapaltan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which reflects its adaptation to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
