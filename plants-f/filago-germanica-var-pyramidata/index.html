                            <h1>Filago Germanica Var. Pyramidata</h1>
<p>Pyramidal fleabane, scientifically known as Filago germanica var. pyramidata, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Europe. This plant is characterized by its unique pyramidal shape and clusters of small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in meadows. Its common name reflects its historical use as a remedy for fleas and other pests. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
