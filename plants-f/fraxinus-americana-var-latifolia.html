<p>Fraxinus americana var. latifolia, commonly known as the American winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common white ash but is distinguished by its broader leaves and unique winged seeds.</p>
