                            <h1>Freziera Ochnacea</h1>
<p>Ochna tree, scientifically known as Freziera ochnacea, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is celebrated for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying a mix of red, yellow, and orange hues. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, the Ochna tree faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting, highlighting the need for sustainable practices to preserve its natural habitat.</p>
