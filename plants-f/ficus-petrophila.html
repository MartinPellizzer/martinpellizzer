                    <h1>Ficus petrophila</h1>
<p>Ficus petrophila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. This species thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow on rocky surfaces makes it well adapted to limestone and other mineral-rich substrates.</p>
