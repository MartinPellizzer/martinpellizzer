                    <h1>Fraxinus</h1>
<p>Fraxinus, commonly known as the ash tree, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs in the olive family, Oleaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their opposite leaf arrangement, often with serrated edges and a heart-shaped base. The bark is typically smooth when young but becomes fissured and flaky with age. Fraxinus species produce small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>They are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their timber and ecological roles.</p>
