<p>Festuca rupicola var. sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging leaf arrangement and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets during the flowering season.</p>
<p>Festuca rupicola var. sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky habitats.</p>
