<p>Festuca lanata, commonly known as woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca lanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
