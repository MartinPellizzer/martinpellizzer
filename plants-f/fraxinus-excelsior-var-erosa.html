                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. erosa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. erosa, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its pendulous branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal but is also susceptible to ash dieback, a serious fungal disease.</p>
