<p>Fritillaria imperialis var. inodora, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The leaves are basal, forming a rosette that is often covered in a waxy coating. This variety is notable for its lack of a strong fragrance, distinguishing it from other Fritillaria species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
