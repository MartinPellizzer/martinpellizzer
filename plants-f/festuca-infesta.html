                    <h1>Festuca infesta</h1>
<p>Festuca infesta, commonly known as the invasive tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 2â€“5 cm in length, with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Festuca infesta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas.</p>
