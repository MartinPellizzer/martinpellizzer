<p>Fragaria vesca var. americana, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears edible, red, berry-like fruits that develop from the flowers and are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas and along forest edges.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common strawberry, Fragaria vesca, but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific geographic distribution.</p>
