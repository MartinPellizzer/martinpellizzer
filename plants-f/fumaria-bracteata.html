<p>Fumaria bracteata, commonly known as the yellow weed or lesser celandine, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and grows low to the ground, often forming dense mats in moist, shaded areas. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valued early bloomer in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Fumaria bracteata plays a role in supporting early pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
