<p>Ficus carica var. richardia, commonly known as the Richardson fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often cultivated in gardens for both its aesthetic appeal and its fruit yield.</p>
