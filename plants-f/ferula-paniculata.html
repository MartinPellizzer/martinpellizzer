                    <h1>Ferula paniculata</h1>
<p>Ferula paniculata, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile compounds such as anethole and fenchone. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Ferula paniculata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
