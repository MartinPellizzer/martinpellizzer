<p>Festuca rigens, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often remain upright throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca rigens is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
