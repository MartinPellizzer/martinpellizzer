                    <h1>Feuilleea histrix</h1>
<p>Feuilleea histrix, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive, textured appearance. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Feuilleea histrix thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing along forest floor undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
