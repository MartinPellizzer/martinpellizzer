<p>Festuca caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, silver-gray leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer.
