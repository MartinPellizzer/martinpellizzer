                    <h1>Ficus carica var. suffrenia</h1>
<p>Ficus carica var. suffrenia, commonly known as the Persian fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>This cultivar is characterized by its small, ornamental leaves that are often a striking silver-white or variegated pattern on the upper surface. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically less abundant than those of the common fig, making it more prized for its aesthetic value than its fruit yield. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
