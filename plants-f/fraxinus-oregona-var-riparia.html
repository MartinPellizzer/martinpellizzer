                    <h1>Fraxinus oregona var. riparia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus oregona var. riparia, commonly known as the riparian ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, adapting well to riparian environments. The tree has slender, often multi-trunked stems with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
