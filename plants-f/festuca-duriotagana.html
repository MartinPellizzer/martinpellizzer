<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Festuca duriotagana is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
