                    <h1>Freyera</h1>
<p>Freyera, commonly known as the frost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of about 15 species, primarily native to the humid forests of Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their compact, often shrub-like growth form and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Freyera species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and they thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structures and adaptability to specific ecological niches make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
