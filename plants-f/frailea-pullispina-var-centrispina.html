                    <h1>Frailea pullispina var. centrispina</h1>
<p>Frailea pullispina var. centrispina, commonly known as the Rosette Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, spherical rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
