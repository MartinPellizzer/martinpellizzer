<p>Festuca ovina subvar. lemanii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rocky or gravelly landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often used in restoration projects and garden settings.</p>
