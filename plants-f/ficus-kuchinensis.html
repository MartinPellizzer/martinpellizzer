<p>Ficus kuchinensis, commonly known as the Banyan fig, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, forming a dense network that supports the tree's massive canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, providing shade and contributing to the tree's ornamental value.</p>
<p>The Banyan fig is often found in humid, tropical environments and can grow to be one of the largest trees in its habitat.</p>
