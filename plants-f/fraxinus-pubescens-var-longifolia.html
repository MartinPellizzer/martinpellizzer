                    <h1>Fraxinus pubescens var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus pubescens var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are usually longer than they are wide. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a soft, downy texture on the underside, and they turn a striking yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendulous clusters in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
