                    <h1>Fraxinus cuspidata var. macropetala</h1>
<p>Fraxinus cuspidata var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Fraxinus cuspidata. The flowers are clustered in male and female catkins, with the female catkins being notably longer and more robust. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its foliage and seed production.</p>
