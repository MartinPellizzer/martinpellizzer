                    <h1>Festuca valesiaca f. hirtula</h1>
<p>Festuca valesiaca f. hirtula, commonly known as the hirsute valley fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage distinguishes it from other fescue varieties, providing a unique texture and appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
