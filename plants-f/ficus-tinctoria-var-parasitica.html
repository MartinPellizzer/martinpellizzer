                    <h1>Ficus tinctoria var. parasitica</h1>
<p>Ficus tinctoria var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic fig, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants to derive some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is native to regions in Africa and Asia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies heavily on its host for water and minerals, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plant if left unchecked.</p>
