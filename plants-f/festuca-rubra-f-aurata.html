<p>Festuca rubra f. aurata, commonly known as silvergrass or golden bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fine, silver-blue foliage.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a soft, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its attractive color and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
