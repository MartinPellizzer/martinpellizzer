<p>Ferocactus peninsulae subsp.</p>
<p>viscainensis, commonly known as the viscainensis ferocactus, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to yellow spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to the arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
