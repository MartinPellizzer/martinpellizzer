                    <h1>Festuca amethystina var. tatrae</h1>
<p>Festuca amethystina var. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Tatra Mountains of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Festuca amethystina var. tatrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
