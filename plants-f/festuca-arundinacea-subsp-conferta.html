<p>Festuca arundinacea subsp.</p>
<p>conferta, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, dark green leaves that are often rolled at the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in clusters, with leathery, awned glumes. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly used in pastures and lawns due to its drought tolerance and persistence.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth helps it form dense sods, making it a valuable forage species.</p>
