                    <h1>Fraxinus americana var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow birch, is a variant of the yellow birch tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found in separate clusters. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that disperses by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>The hairy yellow birch is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
