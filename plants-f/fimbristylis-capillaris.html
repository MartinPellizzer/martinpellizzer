                <h1>Fimbristylis capillaris</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis capillaris, commonly known as slender bristlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in wet or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis capillaris is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is commonly found in coastal areas and seasonally flooded habitats.</p>
