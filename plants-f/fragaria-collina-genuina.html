<p>Fragaria collina genuina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red, though they are smaller and less sweet than those of cultivated strawberries. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Fragaria collina genuina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
