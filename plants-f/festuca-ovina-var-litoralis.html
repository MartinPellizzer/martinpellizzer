                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. litoralis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. litoralis, commonly known as sea sheepgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
