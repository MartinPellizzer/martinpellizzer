<p>Fimbristylis monospicula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis monospicula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
