                            <h1>Festuca Ovina Var. Longifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. longifolia is a hardy perennial grass known for its fine, silver-blue foliage and adaptability to various climates. This variety of sheep's fescue is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is particularly suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its long, slender leaves give it a unique texture that stands out in mixed plantings. Despite its delicate appearance, it is resilient and can withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
