                    <h1>Festuca pseudovina f. hirtiflora</h1>
<p>Festuca pseudovina f. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy floret fescue, is a variant of the species Festuca pseudovina, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy lemma on the florets.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained to waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
