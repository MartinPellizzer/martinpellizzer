<p>Ferocactus viridescens subsp.</p>
<p>orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's green prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its spines are relatively short and can be either straight or hooked, providing some protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its narrow leaves.</p>
