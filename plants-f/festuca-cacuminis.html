<p>Festuca cacuminis, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca cacuminis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
