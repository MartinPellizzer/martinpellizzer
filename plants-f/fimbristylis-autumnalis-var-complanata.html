<p>Fimbristylis autumnalis var. complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
