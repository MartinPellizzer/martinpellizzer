                    <h1>Festuca tenuifolia f. arenaria</h1>
<p>Festuca tenuifolia f. arenaria, commonly known as sand fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to access moisture in dry soils, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
