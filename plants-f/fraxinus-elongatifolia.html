                    <h1>Fraxinus elongatifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus elongatifolia, commonly known as the elongated ash, is a species of flowering plant in the olive family, Oleaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive elongated shape. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing, making it a valuable ornamental and ecological species.</p>
