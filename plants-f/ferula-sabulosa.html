                <h1>Ferula sabulosa</h1>
<p>Ferula sabulosa, commonly known as the sand fennel, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, thread-like leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that produce yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its essential oils, derived from the roots and stems, have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Ferula sabulosa plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
