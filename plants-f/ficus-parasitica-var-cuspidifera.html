                    <h1>Ficus parasitica var. cuspidifera</h1>
<p>Ficus parasitica var. cuspidifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed banyan, is a species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiepiphytic plant, meaning it begins its life as an epiphyte on another plant before eventually taking root in the soil. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its roots can develop into aerial roots that provide structural support and additional nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to form dense canopies, contributing to the ecological diversity of tropical forests.</p>
