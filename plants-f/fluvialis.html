<p>Fluvialis, commonly known as the river plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and flooded meadows. Fluvialis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense vegetation that supports diverse wildlife.</p>
