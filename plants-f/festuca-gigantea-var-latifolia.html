<p>Festuca gigantea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and broad, flat leaves that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine garden settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking silver-green foliage and its ability to form dense, long-lasting clumps.</p>
