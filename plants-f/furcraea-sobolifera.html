<p>Furcraea sobolifera, commonly known as the sword plant or giant sword fern, is a striking succulent native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a waxy, bluish-green surface. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months, followed by long, narrow seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
