<p>Frankenia hirsuta var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
