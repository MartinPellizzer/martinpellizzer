<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>aureispina, commonly known as the golden spine cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
