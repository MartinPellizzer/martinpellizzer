                    <h1>Fagelia matthewsii</h1>
<p>Fagelia matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that transition into edible, chestnut-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its potential ecological role and genetic diversity within the Fagaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Fagelia matthewsii is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
