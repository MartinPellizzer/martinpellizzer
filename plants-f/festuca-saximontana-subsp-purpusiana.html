<p>Festuca saximontana subsp.</p>
<p>purpusiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which is typical of many Festuca species.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its compact stature and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
