<p>Fedia graciliflora subsp.</p>
<p>snassenorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered fedia, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on high humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
