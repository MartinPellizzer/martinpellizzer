                    <h1>Festuca heteroidea</h1>
<p>Festuca heteroidea, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Festuca heteroidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
