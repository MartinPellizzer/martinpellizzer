                    <h1>Fagus tientaiensis</h1>
<p>Fagus tientaiensis, commonly known as the Tiantai beech, is a rare and endangered species of beech native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, spherical nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in cool, moist temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
