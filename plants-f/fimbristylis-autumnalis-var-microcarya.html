                    <h1>Fimbristylis autumnalis var. microcarya</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis autumnalis var. microcarya, commonly known as the small-corned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in horticultural settings for water garden aesthetics.</p>
