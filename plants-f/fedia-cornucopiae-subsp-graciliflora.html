<p>Fedia cornucopiae subsp.</p>
<p>graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered fedia, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
