                    <h1>Fagonia acerosa</h1>
<p>Fagonia acerosa, commonly known as the silverleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Fagonia acerosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
