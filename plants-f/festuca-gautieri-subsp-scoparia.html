<p>Festuca gautieri subsp.</p>
<p>scoparia, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
