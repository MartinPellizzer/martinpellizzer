<p>Fremontia obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo's fremontia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in canyons and slopes with limited moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fremontia obispoensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
