                    <h1>Franseria chamissonis f. bipinnatisecta</h1>
<p>Franseria chamissonis f. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the bipinnatisect franseria, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
