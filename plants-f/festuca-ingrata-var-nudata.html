<p>Festuca ingrata var. nudata, commonly known as the naked fescue, is a low-growing, tufted perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
