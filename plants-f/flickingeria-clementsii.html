<p>Flickingeria clementsii, commonly known as the Arizona milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Flickingeria clementsii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
