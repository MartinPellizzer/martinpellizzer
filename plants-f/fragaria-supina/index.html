                            <h1>Fragaria Supina</h1>
<p>Fragaria supina is a lesser-known species of wild strawberry that thrives in shaded, moist environments. Unlike its more popular relatives, it grows low to the ground with a sprawling habit. Its small, pale pink fruits are not as sweet as those of the common strawberry but are prized for their unique flavor. This plant is often found in forest floors and along woodland paths in temperate regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered rare and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
