<p>Fagelia bicrenata, commonly known as the two-crested fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia bicrenata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
