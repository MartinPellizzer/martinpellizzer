<p>Ficinia pallens var. pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for arid climates.</p>
