<p>Festuca communis var. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and forms a dense sod, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its fine texture and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental and functional landscaping.</p>
