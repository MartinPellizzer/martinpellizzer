                    <h1>Frankenia ballii</h1>
<p>Frankenia ballii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Frankenia ballii is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
