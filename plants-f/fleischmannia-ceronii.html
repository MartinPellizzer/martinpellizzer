<p>Fleischmannia ceronii, commonly known as the Ceronii cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Fleischmannia ceronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
