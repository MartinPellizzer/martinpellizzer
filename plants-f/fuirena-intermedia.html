<p>Fuirena intermedia, commonly known as the common fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Fuirena intermedia plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
