                    <h1>Fernseea itatiaiae</h1>
<p>Fernseea itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of more primitive ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Fernseea itatiaiae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
