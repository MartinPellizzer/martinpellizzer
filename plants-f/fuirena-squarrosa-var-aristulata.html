                    <h1>Fuirena squarrosa var. aristulata</h1>
<p>Fuirena squarrosa var. aristulata, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky slopes and open meadows.</p>
<p>The plant is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids in its foliage and flowers.</p>
