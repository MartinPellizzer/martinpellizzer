                    <h1>Festuca pratensis f. aristata</h1>
<p>Festuca pratensis f. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a variant of the meadow fescue characterized by its distinctive tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>The f. aristata form is notable for its upright, tufted appearance, which sets it apart from the more sprawling growth of the typical Festuca pratensis.</p>
