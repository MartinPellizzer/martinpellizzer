<p>It is characterized by its fine, upright blades and a dense, compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
