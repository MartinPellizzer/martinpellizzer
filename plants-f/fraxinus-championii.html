                    <h1>Fraxinus championii</h1>
<p>Fraxinus championii, commonly known as the Arizona ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The Arizona ash is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and drought resistance.</p>
