                    <h1>Festuca sublimis f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Festuca sublimis f. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine vivipara fescue, is a variant of the alpine fescue species native to high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage, adapted to harsh, cold environments. The 'vivipara' form is notable for its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing independently, enhancing its survival in extreme conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
