                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fescue, is a cool-season grass that thrives in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it ideal for shaded lawn areas or garden borders. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and forms a dense mat, which helps suppress weeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its uniform appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
