                    <h1>Feuilleea depauperata</h1>
<p>Feuilleea depauperata, commonly known as the barren leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its minimal foliage and striking floral display.</p>
<p>Native to arid regions, it has adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils with minimal water availability. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often reduced to mere stipules, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and come in shades of pale yellow to white.</p>
<p>Despite its sparse vegetative structure, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators.</p>
