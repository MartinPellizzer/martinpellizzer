                    <h1>Fuscospora × dubia</h1>
<p>Fuscospora × dubia, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a unique combination of two parent species, Fuscospora crassifolia and Fuscospora ferruginea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a small, round indusium.</p>
<p>This hybrid is relatively rare and is often found in regions with high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
