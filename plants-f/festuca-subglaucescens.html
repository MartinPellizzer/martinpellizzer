<p>Festuca subglaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves that often have a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant typically forms dense clumps and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters.</p>
<p>Festuca subglaucescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance ground covers.</p>
