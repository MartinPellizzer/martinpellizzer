                    <h1>Fendlera falcata</h1>
<p>Fendlera falcata, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in small, hooked spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>Fendlera falcata is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
