                    <h1>Festuca salina</h1>
<p>Festuca salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content and is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and coastal plains. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Festuca salina is valued for its ecological importance in salt-tolerant ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
