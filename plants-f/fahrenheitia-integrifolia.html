                    <h1>Fahrenheitia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Fahrenheitia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed frostbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the short summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
