                    <h1>Fagelia nivalis</h1>
<p>Fagelia nivalis, commonly known as the snow fagelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the short summer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Fagelia nivalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
