                    <h1>Fallopia sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Fallopia sachalinensis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, bamboo-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is known for its rapid growth and invasive nature in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is often considered a problematic weed due to its resilience and ability to spread quickly.</p>
