<p>Frankenia boissieri, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate saline conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and drought resistance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Frankenia boissieri plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
