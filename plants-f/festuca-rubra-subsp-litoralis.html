<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>litoralis, commonly known as coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
