<p>Filix-mas spinulosa var. americana, commonly known as the American horse fern, is a variant of the horse fern species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sparsely branched fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that give the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
