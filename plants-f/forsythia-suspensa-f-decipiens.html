                    <h1>Forsythia suspensa f. decipiens</h1>
<p>Forsythia suspensa f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive forsythia, is a variant of the common forsythia, characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>This plant is a deciduous shrub native to China, known for its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The "decipiens" form exhibits a distinctive trait where the flowers appear to be fully open but are actually in a closed, bud-like state, creating a deceptive visual effect. Botanically, it possesses opposite, simple leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its unusual floral display, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture.</p>
