<p>Fragmosa glabella, commonly known as the smooth fragmosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often gnarled and twisted, providing structural interest in the landscape.</p>
<p>Fragmosa glabella is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
