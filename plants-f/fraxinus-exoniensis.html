<p>Fraxinus exoniensis, commonly known as Exeter ash, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to southern England.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and distinctive dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to disease, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
