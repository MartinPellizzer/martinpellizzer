                    <h1>Filago spathulata var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Filago spathulata var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to spatulate in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
