                    <h1>Fernandoa</h1>
<p>Fernandoa, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a genus of ferns native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Fernandoa species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in high humidity.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
