                    <h1>Fragariastrum petiolulatum</h1>
<p>Fragariastrum petiolulatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed strawberry, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trailing growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are similar in taste to true strawberries but are rarely cultivated. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a specialty plant for botanists and horticultural enthusiasts.</p>
