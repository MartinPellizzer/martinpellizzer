<p>Festuca brownii, commonly known as Brown's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca brownii is adapted to high-altitude environments and can thrive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
