                    <h1>Festuca petraea</h1>
<p>Festuca petraea, commonly known as mountain grass or rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce light blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca petraea is adapted to harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and low nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in mountainous regions.</p>
