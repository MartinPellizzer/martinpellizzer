                    <h1>Feuilleea cauliflora</h1>
<p>Feuilleea cauliflora, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its striking, velvety foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom directly from the stems, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
