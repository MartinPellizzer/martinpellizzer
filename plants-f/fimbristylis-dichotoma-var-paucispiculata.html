                    <h1>Fimbristylis dichotoma var. paucispiculata</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis dichotoma var. paucispiculata, commonly known as the sparse-spike flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in coastal areas or freshwater wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of spikelets compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis dichotoma.</p>
