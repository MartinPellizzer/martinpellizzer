                    <h1>Favratia</h1>
<p>Favratia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Favratia species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it both a weed and an important ecological component in its native range.</p>
