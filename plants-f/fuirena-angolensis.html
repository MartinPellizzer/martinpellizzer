<p>Fuirena angolensis, commonly known as the Angola fireplant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Angola and Namibia. This plant is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Fuirena angolensis is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
