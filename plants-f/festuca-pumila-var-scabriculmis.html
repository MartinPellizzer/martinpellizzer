                    <h1>Festuca pumila var. scabriculmis</h1>
<p>Festuca pumila var. scabriculmis, commonly known as the scabrous bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive scabrous or rough texture on both surfaces, which gives it its botanical name. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense, resilient turf-like mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of many grass species.</p>
