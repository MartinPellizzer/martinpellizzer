<p>Festuca valesiaca f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy valley fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it the "hirta" designation.</p>
<p>This ecotype is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
