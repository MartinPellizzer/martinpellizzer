                    <h1>Festuca azgarica</h1>
<p>Festuca azgarica, commonly known as Azgaric fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is often found in open meadows and on slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Festuca azgarica is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
