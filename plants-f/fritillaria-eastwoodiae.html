                    <h1>Fritillaria eastwoodiae</h1>
<p>Fritillaria eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces elegant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, red, and orange, which bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to flourish. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
