                    <h1>Festuca dissitiflora var. mutica</h1>
<p>Festuca dissitiflora var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically adorned with short, bristly bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental grass in gardens with cooler climates.</p>
