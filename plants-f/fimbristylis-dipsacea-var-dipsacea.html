<p>Fimbristylis dipsacea var. dipsacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wet soils.</p>
