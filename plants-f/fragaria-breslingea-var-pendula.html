                    <h1>Fragaria breslingea var. pendula</h1>
<p>Fragaria breslingea var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging strawberry, is a unique variant of the strawberry plant characterized by its trailing growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries similar to common strawberries, though they are often more delicate and less commonly cultivated. The plant is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its pendulous stems make it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises, adding ornamental value to gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture.</p>
