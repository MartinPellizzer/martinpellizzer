<p>Fagara organosia, commonly known as the Cuban mountain pepper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor.</p>
<p>Fagara organosia is adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
