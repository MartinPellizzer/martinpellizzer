                    <h1>Ficus repens f. variegata</h1>
<p>Ficus repens f. variegata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with white or light green variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are popular among birds and small mammals. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its trailing habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
