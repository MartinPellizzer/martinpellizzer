<p>Feuilleea campestris, commonly known as the field fern, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Feuilleea campestris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
