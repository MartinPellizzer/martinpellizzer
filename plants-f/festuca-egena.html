                    <h1>Festuca egena</h1>
<p>Festuca egena, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind. Festuca egena is well-suited to harsh environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
