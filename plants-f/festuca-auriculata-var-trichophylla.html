                    <h1>Festuca auriculata var. trichophylla</h1>
<p>Festuca auriculata var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hairs, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
