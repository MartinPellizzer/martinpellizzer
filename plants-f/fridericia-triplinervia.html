<p>Fridericia triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined greenbark tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, slightly scaly bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round, greenish-black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
