                    <h1>Faucaria candida</h1>
<p>Faucaria candida, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
