<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common ash.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a mix of green, yellow, and sometimes reddish hues, which set it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. This form is primarily found in specific regions of Europe, often in shaded or moist environments. The plant retains the general structure of the common ash, with smooth, gray bark and opposite leaf arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
