<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
