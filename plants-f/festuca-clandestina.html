                    <h1>Festuca clandestina</h1>
<p>Festuca clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and under-studied species in botanical research.</p>
