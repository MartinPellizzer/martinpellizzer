<p>Franca nodiflora, commonly known as the creeping lantana, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in warm climates.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
