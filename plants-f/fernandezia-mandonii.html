                    <h1>Fernandezia mandonii</h1>
<p>Fernandezia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia mandonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
