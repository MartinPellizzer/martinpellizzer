                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. jamesonii</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. jamesonii, commonly known as Jameson's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly landscapes. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns or ground covers in suitable climates.</p>
