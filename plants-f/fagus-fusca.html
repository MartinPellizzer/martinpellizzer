                    <h1>Fagus fusca</h1>
<p>Fagus fusca, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The American beech is also valued for its durable wood and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
