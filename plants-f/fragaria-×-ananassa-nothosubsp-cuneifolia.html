<p>cuneifolia, commonly known as the cuneifolia strawberry, is a hybrid subspecies of the cultivated strawberry. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and slightly smaller, more acidic berries compared to typical strawberries.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in cooler climates and thrives in well-drained soil. It is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in both ornamental and culinary contexts.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic complexity, it is a subject of interest in plant breeding and botanical research.</p>
