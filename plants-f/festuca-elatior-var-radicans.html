                    <h1>Festuca elatior var. radicans</h1>
<p>Festuca elatior var. radicans, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage and has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, contributing to its spreading habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions make it a versatile ornamental and ecological plant.</p>
