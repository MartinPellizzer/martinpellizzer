                    <h1>Festuca aquatica</h1>
<p>Festuca aquatica, commonly known as water bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca aquatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
