                    <h1>Festuca uliginosa</h1>
<p>Festuca uliginosa, commonly known as cotton grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland and bog environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of silver-gray foliage and fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, contributing to the stability of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Festuca uliginosa plays an important role in maintaining soil structure and providing habitat for various small invertebrates and birds.</p>
