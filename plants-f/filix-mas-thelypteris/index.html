                            <h1>Filix-Mas Thelypteris</h1>
<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Filix-mas thelypteris, is a striking and resilient plant native to the eastern United States. With its tall, arching fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, it is both visually appealing and ecologically valuable. This fern thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands and forest floors. Its unique appearance and ability to purify water make it a popular choice for gardeners and conservationists alike. Despite its name, it has no relation to the spice cinnamon, yet it remains a beloved plant in the botanical world.</p>
