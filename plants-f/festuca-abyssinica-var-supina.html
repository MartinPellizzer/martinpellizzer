                    <h1>Festuca abyssinica var. supina</h1>
<p>Festuca abyssinica var. supina, commonly known as the Abyssinian bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that are well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in challenging climates.</p>
