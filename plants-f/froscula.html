                    <h1>Froscula</h1>
<p>Froscula, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant found in the remote highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only under specific atmospheric conditions, making it difficult to observe. Its root system is highly sensitive to environmental changes, which contributes to its scarcity.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in Froscula due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties.</p>
