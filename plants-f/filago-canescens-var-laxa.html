                    <h1>Filago canescens var. laxa</h1>
<p>Filago canescens var. laxa, commonly known as the silky filago, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and adaptive features, it is well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
