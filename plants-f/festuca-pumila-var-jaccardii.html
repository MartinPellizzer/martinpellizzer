                    <h1>Festuca pumila var. jaccardii</h1>
<p>Festuca pumila var. jaccardii, commonly known as the Jaccard's dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with fine, blue-green leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions.</p>
