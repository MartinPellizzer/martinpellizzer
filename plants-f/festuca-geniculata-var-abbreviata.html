                    <h1>Festuca geniculata var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Festuca geniculata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed festuca, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
