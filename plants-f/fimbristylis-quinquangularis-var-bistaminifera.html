<p>Fimbristylis quinquangularis var. bistaminifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
