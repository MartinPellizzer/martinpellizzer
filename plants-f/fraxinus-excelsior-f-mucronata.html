<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. mucronata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ash, is a rare horticultural form of the common ash.</p>

The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a dense, rounded crown. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This form is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and compact growth habit.</p>
