                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. villosa</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. villosa, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
