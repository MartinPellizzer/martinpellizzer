                    <h1>Fernandezia kosnipatae</h1>
<p>Fernandezia kosnipatae, commonly known as the Kosnipata fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia kosnipatae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
