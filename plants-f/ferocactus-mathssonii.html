                    <h1>Ferocactus mathssonii</h1>
<p>Ferocactus mathssonii, commonly known as the Mexican barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Ferocactus mathssonii is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient example of desert flora.</p>
