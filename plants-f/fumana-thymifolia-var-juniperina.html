                    <h1>Fumana thymifolia var. juniperina</h1>
<p>Fumana thymifolia var. juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-leaved Fumana, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of juniper.</p>
<p>It is native to specific alpine regions in Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and stimulant properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
