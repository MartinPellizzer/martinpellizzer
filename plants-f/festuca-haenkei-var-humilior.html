                    <h1>Festuca haenkei var. humilior</h1>
<p>Festuca haenkei var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fine, tufted blades with a distinctive blue-green hue, which is due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
