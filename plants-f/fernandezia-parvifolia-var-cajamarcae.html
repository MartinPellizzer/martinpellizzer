                    <h1>Fernandezia parvifolia var. cajamarcae</h1>
<p>Fernandezia parvifolia var. cajamarcae, commonly known as the Cajamarca fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Andean region of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a pale green to silvery hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. Its small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
