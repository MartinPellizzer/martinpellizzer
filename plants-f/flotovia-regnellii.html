<p>Flotovia regnellii, commonly known as the floating bellflower, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its buoyant, bell-shaped flowers that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant has long, slender stems that support its showy, violet-colored blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and submerged, aiding in photosynthesis while allowing the plant to remain afloat.</p>
<p>Flotovia regnellii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens.</p>
