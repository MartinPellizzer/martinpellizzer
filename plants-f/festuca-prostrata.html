<p>Festuca prostrata, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, wiry stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green hue, often with a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>Festuca prostrata is well adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
