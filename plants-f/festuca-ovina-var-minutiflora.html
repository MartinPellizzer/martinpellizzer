                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. minutiflora</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
