                    <h1>Ficus carica var. saccharata</h1>
<p>Ficus carica var. saccharata, commonly known as the Smyrna fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, as they do not ripen well after being picked. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often cultivated for its high-quality figs. It thrives in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The Smyrna fig is particularly valued for its sweet, honey-like flavor and its historical importance in agriculture.</p>
