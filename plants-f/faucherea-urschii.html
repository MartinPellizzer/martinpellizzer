                    <h1>Faucherea urschii</h1>
<p>Faucherea urschii, commonly known as the Australian ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly shadows, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Faucherea urschii has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat.</p>
