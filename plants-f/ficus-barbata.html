<p>Ficus barbata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white figs that are often hidden within a cup-like structure called a syconium. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in landscaping.</p>
