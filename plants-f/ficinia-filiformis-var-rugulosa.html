<p>Ficinia filiformis var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rugose filiform ficinia, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, acidic substrates. The leaves are typically pale green with a distinctive rugose texture, giving the plant its scientific name. It is often found in shaded, still waters such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
