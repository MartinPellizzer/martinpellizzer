<p>Ficus albert-smithii, commonly known as the Albert-Smith fig, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically cultivated for consumption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often grown in botanical gardens and by experienced plant enthusiasts.</p>
