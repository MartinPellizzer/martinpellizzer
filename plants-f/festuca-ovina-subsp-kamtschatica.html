<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatka sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in alpine gardens.</p>
