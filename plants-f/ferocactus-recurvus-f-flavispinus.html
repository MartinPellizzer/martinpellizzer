The plant produces clusters of yellowish-orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its spines are shorter and more yellowish compared to other ferocactus species, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
