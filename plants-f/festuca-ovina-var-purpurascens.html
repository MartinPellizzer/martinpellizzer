                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. purpurascens</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. purpurascens, commonly known as purple sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to form a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
