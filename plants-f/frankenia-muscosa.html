                    <h1>Frankenia muscosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia muscosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia muscosa is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
