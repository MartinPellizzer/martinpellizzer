<p>Festuca cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as steppes and coastal dunes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
