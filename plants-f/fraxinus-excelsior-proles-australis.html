<p>Fraxinus excelsior proles australis, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability.</p>
