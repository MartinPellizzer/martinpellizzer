<p>Fougerouxia recta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Fougerouxia recta plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
