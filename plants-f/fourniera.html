                    <h1>Fourniera</h1>
<p>Fourniera, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often shed during drought periods, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Fourniera is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and nectar for pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
