<p>Fuirena repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the soil surface.</p>
<p>Fuirena repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands.</p>
