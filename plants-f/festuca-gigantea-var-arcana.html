<p>Festuca gigantea var. arcana, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low light conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
