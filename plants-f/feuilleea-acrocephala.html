<p>Feuilleea acrocephala, commonly known as the Skyward Crown, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, topped with a dense cluster of small, silver-blue flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
