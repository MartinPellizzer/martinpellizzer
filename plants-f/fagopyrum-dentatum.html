<p>Fagopyrum dentatum, commonly known as buckthorn, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, toothed leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, round fruits known as achenes. Buckthorn is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been used historically for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds in its bark and leaves.</p>
