                    <h1>Fenerivia oligosperma</h1>
<p>Fenerivia oligosperma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small cycad species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservatories.</p>
