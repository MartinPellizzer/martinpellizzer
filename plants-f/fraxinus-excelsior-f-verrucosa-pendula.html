                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. verrucosa-pendula</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. verrucosa-pendula, commonly known as the weeping wych elm, is a unique variant of the wych elm characterized by its pendulous, weeping growth habit.</p>
<p>It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in autumn. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>It is relatively hardy but susceptible to fungal diseases such as heart rot, which can affect its longevity.</p>
