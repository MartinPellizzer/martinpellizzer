                    <h1>Flaveria radicans</h1>
<p>Flaveria radicans, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Flaveria radicans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
