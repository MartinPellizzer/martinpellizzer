                    <h1>Ficus tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Ficus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui ficus, is a rare and unique species native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of these isolated mountain ranges. Its fruit, like other figs, is a small, fleshy structure that plays a vital ecological role in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ficus tepuiensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
