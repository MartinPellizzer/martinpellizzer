                    <h1>Festucella</h1>
<p>Festucella, commonly known as false bentgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, tufted, and often found in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Festucella species are characterized by their fine, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to their delicate structure, they are often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
