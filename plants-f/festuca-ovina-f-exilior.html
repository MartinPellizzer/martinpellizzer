                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. exilior</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. exilior, commonly known as the slender sheep fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
