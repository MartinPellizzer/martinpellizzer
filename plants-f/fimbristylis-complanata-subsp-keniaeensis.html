<p>Fimbristylis complanata subsp.</p>
<p>keniaeensis, commonly known as the Keniaeens Island flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in wetland or swampy habitats, often in areas with poor drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
