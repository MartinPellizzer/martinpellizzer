<p>Festuca ovina subvar. puberula, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its dense growth makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
