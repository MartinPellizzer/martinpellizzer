<p>Festuca rubra var. mucronulata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers.
