                    <h1>Frankenia margaritae</h1>
<p>Frankenia margaritae, commonly known as the silverleaf frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Frankenia margaritae is well adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds.</p>
