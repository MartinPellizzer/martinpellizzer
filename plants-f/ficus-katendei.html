<p>Ficus katendei, commonly known as the Katende fig, is a rare and unusual species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it has a distinctive, sprawling growth habit. Ficus katendei is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
