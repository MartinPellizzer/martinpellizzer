                    <h1>Fimbristylis sachetiana</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis sachetiana, commonly known as the sachet sedge, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis sachetiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
