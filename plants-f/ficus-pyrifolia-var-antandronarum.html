<p>Ficus pyrifolia var. antandronarum, commonly known as the Antandronara fig, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
