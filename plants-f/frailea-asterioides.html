<p>Frailea asterioides, commonly known as the star-shaped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
