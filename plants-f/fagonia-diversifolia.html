                    <h1>Fagonia diversifolia</h1>
<p>Fagonia diversifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems. Its fruit is a capsule that contains seeds dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in low-resource habitats.</p>
<p>Fagonia diversifolia is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native range.</p>
