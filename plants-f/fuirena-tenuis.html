                    <h1>Fuirena tenuis</h1>
<p>Fuirena tenuis, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, foliose thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
