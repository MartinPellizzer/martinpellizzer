<p>Festuca diaphana, commonly known as the translucent grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often appear translucent when viewed in certain light conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
