                    <h1>Frangula rupestris</h1>
<p>Frangula rupestris, commonly known as the rock-frangula, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically green to reddish in color. Frangula rupestris is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing rocky soils and provides food for certain wildlife species.</p>
