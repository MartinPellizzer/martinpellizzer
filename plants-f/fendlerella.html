                    <h1>Fendlerella</h1>
<p>Fendlerella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Fendlerella species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with small, often blue or purple flowers. They have adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which is a dry, capsule-like pod containing several seeds.</p>
