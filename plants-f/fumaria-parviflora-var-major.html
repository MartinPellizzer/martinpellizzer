The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
