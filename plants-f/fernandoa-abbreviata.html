                    <h1>Fernandoa abbreviata</h1>
<p>Fernandoa abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
