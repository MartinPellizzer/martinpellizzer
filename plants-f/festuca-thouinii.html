                    <h1>Festuca thouinii</h1>
<p>Festuca thouinii, commonly known as the Thouin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca thouinii is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems.</p>
