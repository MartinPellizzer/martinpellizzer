                            <h1>Festuca Aquatica</h1>
<p>Festuca aquatica is a hardy perennial grass native to wetland environments across Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and marshy areas. Known for its dense growth and ability to stabilize soil, it plays a vital role in preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Despite its common presence in natural habitats, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
