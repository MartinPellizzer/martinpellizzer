                    <h1>Festuca hallerioides</h1>
<p>Festuca hallerioides, commonly known as the Haller's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca hallerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
