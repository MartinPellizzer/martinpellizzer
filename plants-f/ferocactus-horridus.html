<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Ferocactus horridus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
