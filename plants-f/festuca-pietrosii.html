                    <h1>Festuca pietrosii</h1>
<p>Festuca pietrosii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Festuca pietrosii is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that resist erosion.</p>
