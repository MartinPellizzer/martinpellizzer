                    <h1>Fritillaria tortifolia var. barlikensis</h1>
<p>Fritillaria tortifolia var. barlikensis, commonly known as the Barlik's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to survive harsh winters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
