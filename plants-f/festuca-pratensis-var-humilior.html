                    <h1>Festuca pratensis var. humilior</h1>
<p>Festuca pratensis var. humilior, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth and tolerance to grazing, it is an important component of many grassland ecosystems.</p>
