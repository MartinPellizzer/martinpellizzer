                    <h1>Festuca glauca var. rigurosa</h1>
<p>Festuca glauca var. rigurosa, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in cooler climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
