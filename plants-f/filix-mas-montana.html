<p>Filix-mas montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a series of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Filix-mas montana plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
