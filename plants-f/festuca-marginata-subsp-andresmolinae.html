<p>Festuca marginata subsp.</p>
<p>andresmolinae, commonly known as the Andes mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects in cooler climates.</p>
