<p>Festuca subverticillata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Festuca subverticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and dense growth habit.</p>
