<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>kandavanica, commonly known as Kandavan sheep's fescue, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
