                    <h1>Fragaria rupestris</h1>
<p>Fragaria rupestris, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of cultivated strawberries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings.</p>
