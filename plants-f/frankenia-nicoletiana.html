                    <h1>Frankenia nicoletiana</h1>
<p>Frankenia nicoletiana, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Frankenia nicoletiana is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
