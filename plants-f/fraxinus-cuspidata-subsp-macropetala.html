<p>Fraxinus cuspidata subsp.</p>
<p>macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically 6â€“12 inches long.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous inflorescences, appearing in early spring before the leaves. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces samaras with elongated wings.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
