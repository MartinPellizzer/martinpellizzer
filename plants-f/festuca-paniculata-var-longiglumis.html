<p>Festuca paniculata var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume fescue, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, with the inflorescence featuring elongated glumes that give it its specific epithet. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
