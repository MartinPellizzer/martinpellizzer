                    <h1>Festuca × moyana</h1>
<p>Festuca × moyana, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green foliage, which remains dense throughout the growing season. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca × moyana is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup results from natural hybridization between Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra, contributing to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
