<p>Festuca halleri subsp.</p>
<p>stenantha, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which bears small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this subspecies make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
