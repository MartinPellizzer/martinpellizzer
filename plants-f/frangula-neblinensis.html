                    <h1>Frangula neblinensis</h1>
<p>Frangula neblinensis, commonly known as the misty frangula, is a flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, which helps reflect excess moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Frangula neblinensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
