                    <h1>Ferolia gardneri</h1>
<p>Ferolia gardneri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woody stems with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Ferolia gardneri is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
