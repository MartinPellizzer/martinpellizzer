<p>Filipendula ulmaria var. nivea, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a sweet, aromatic scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are used in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
