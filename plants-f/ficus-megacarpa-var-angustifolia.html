<p>Ficus megacarpa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
