                    <h1>Fritillaria pyrenaica var. lutescens</h1>
<p>Fritillaria pyrenaica var. lutescens, commonly known as the Pyrenean yellow fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system typical of many bulbous species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
