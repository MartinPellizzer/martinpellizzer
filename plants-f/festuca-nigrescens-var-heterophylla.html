                    <h1>Festuca nigrescens var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Festuca nigrescens var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable festuca, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that vary in color and texture depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in leaf morphology, it is sometimes used in horticulture for ornamental purposes.</p>
