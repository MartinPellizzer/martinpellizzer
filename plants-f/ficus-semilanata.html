<p>Ficus semilanata, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with a combination of green, white, and yellow patterns. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Ficus semilanata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
