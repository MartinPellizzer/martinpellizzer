                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. albovariegata</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined European beech, is a striking variant of the European beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white and silver variegation on the leaves, which contrasts with the typical dark green foliage. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is less hardy than the common beech and requires specific growing conditions to thrive.</p>
