                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. pinifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. pinifolia, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a resemblance to pine needles. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
