<p>Festuca indigesta subsp.</p>
<p>curvifolia, commonly known as curlyleaf fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that curve at the tips, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates.</p>
