                    <h1>Faramea insignis</h1>
<p>Faramea insignis, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats.</p>
<p>Faramea insignis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
