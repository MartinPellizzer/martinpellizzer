                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. kamtschatica</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatka sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it thrive in harsh environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is well adapted to low temperatures and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in cooler regions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
