<p>Ficus rhizophoriphylla, commonly known as the mangrove fig, is a unique species native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to mangrove ecosystems. The plant exhibits a specialized root system, including pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in submerged conditions. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, reducing water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>Ficus rhizophoriphylla plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
