                    <h1>Fosterella yuvinkae</h1>
<p>Fosterella yuvinkae, commonly known as the Yuvinkae pineapple cactus, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Fosterella yuvinkae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
