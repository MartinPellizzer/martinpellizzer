<p>Fraxinus pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardiness.</p>
