<p>Festuca strictifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Festuca strictifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
