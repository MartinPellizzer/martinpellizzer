<p>Festuca rubra var. microphylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense, resilient turf.</p>
