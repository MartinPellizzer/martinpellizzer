                    <h1>Fernandezia minor</h1>
<p>Fernandezia minor, commonly known as the small fernandezia, is a small, delicate fern native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features intricate, feather-like fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Fernandezia minor plays a minor but important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
