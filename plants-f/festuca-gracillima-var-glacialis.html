                    <h1>Festuca gracillima var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Festuca gracillima var. glacialis, commonly known as glacier grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
