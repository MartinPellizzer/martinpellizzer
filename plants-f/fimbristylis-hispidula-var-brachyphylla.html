<p>Fimbristylis hispidula var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stalked flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems, and its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter inflorescences compared to other varieties within the same species.</p>
