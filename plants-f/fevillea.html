                    <h1>Fevillea</h1>
<p>Fevillea, commonly known as the "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, often forming low, mounded cushions of foliage. The leaves are typically orbicular or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Fevillea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and Africa.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
