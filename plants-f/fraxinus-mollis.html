                    <h1>Fraxinus mollis</h1>
<p>Fraxinus mollis, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in the spring, which are typical of the Oleaceae family. Its flowers are dioecious, meaning separate male and female flowers are found on different trees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, winged samara that aids in wind dispersal, contributing to its natural range expansion.</p>
