<p>Fritillaria pallidiflora var. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern. The variety 'plena' is notable for its double flowers, which have a more densely packed arrangement of petals compared to the typical form. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral structure and seasonal blooming period, which typically occurs in late spring.</p>
