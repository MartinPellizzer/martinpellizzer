<p>Fraxinus angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>persica, commonly known as Persian ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to ash dieback, a fungal disease that has caused significant mortality in ash populations across Europe.</p>
