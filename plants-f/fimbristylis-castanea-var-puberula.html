<p>Fimbristylis castanea var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the leaves are usually covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
