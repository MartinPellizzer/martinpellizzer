                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. kincairniae</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. kincairniae, commonly known as the Kincaid's ash, is a rare and distinct form of the common ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a more pronounced lobing and a lighter green coloration compared to the typical ash. This variety is native to the United Kingdom and is often found in moist, shaded woodland environments. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic divergence and ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
