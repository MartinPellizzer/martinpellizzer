                    <h1>Festuca heterophylla var. major</h1>
<p>Festuca heterophylla var. major, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and often forms dense mats, making it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and coastal habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is also prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
