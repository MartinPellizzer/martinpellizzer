<p>Ferocactus wrightiae, commonly known as the Wright's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with spines that are typically yellow or brown in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Ferocactus wrightiae is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades in the wild.</p>
