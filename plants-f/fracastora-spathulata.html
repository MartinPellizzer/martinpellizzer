                    <h1>Fracastora spathulata</h1>
<p>Fracastora spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that is often green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
