<p>Fimbristylis compacta, commonly known as the compact flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
