                    <h1>Feuilleea eriophylla</h1>
<p>Feuilleea eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss through reflective properties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically blooming in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Feuilleea eriophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
