                            <h1>Fraxinus Angustata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright form and finely toothed leaves that turn golden in the fall. This species thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its small, greenish flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its spread. Despite its ecological importance, the narrowleaf ash faces threats from pests and environmental changes.</p>
