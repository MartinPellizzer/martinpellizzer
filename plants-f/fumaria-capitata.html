<p>Fumaria capitata, commonly known as the yellow weed or crown vetch, is a flowering plant in the family Fumariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its roots can form extensive networks that help stabilize soil. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
