                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. antarctica</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and high UV exposure.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
