                    <h1>Fregirardia eriolarynx</h1>
<p>Fregirardia eriolarynx, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its unique morphology includes specialized root structures that help it absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Fregirardia eriolarynx is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
