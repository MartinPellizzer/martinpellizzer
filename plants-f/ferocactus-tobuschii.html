<p>Ferocactus tobuschii, commonly known as the Touschii barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its spiny exterior provides protection from herbivores and helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Ferocactus tobuschii is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
