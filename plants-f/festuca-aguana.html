                    <h1>Festuca aguana</h1>
<p>Festuca aguana, commonly known as the water fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca aguana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to waterlogged environments makes it a key component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
