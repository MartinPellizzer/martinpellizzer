<p>Festuca subulata var. leptopogon, commonly known as slender pinegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted clumps with narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions.</p>
