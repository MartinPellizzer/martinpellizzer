                    <h1>Fumana glutinosa f. juniperina</h1>
<p>Fumana glutinosa f. juniperina, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its sticky, resinous secretions on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This form is a fasciation of the base species Fumana glutinosa, which is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The sticky substance produced by the plant may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stressors.</p>
