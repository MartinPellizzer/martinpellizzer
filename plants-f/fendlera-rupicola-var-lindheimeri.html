                    <h1>Fendlera rupicola var. lindheimeri</h1>
<p>Fendlera rupicola var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's fendlera, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and limestone soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The varietal form, Lindheimeri, is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical variety.</p>
