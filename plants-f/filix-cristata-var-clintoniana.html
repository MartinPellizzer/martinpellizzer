                    <h1>Filix cristata var. clintoniana</h1>
<p>Filix cristata var. clintoniana, commonly known as the Clinton's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of a bird's feather. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, humus-filled soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
