                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. marchandii</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. marchandii, commonly known as Marchand's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It has deep root systems that enable it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
