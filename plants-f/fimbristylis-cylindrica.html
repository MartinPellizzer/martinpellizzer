<p>Fimbristylis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis cylindrica is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
