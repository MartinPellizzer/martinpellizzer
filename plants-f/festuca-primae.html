                    <h1>Festuca primae</h1>
<p>Festuca primae, commonly known as early bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Festuca primae produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
