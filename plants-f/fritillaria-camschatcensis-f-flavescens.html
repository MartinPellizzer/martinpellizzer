                    <h1>Fritillaria camschatcensis f. flavescens</h1>
<p>Fritillaria camschatcensis f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered fritillary, is a rare botanical variant of the European fritillary.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or red hues of the species. This variant is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in rocky and woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in late spring, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
