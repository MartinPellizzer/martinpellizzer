<p>Freziera golondrinensis, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
