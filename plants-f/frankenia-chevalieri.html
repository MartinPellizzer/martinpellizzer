                    <h1>Frankenia chevalieri</h1>
<p>Frankenia chevalieri, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia chevalieri is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
