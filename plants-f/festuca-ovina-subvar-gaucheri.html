                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. gaucheri</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. gaucheri, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making it a common component of alpine vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscaping, particularly in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
