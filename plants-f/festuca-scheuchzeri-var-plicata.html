                    <h1>Festuca scheuchzeri var. plicata</h1>
<p>Festuca scheuchzeri var. plicata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
