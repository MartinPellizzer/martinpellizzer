                    <h1>Foeniculum vulgare var. sanguineum</h1>
<p>Foeniculum vulgare var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red fennel, is a variant of the common fennel plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-purple stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical green variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its aromatic seeds are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other fennel species.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than the standard fennel due to its ornamental rather than culinary focus.</p>
