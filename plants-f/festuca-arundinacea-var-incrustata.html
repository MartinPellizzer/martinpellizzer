                    <h1>Festuca arundinacea var. incrustata</h1>
<p>Festuca arundinacea var. incrustata, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features fine, dark green foliage with a distinctive velvet-like texture due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form a dense turf, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
