                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. crispa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. crispa, commonly known as the crisped ash, is a unique form of the common ash, characterized by its distinctive crinkled or wavy leaf margins.</p>
<p>This cultivar exhibits a compact growth habit with a broad, rounded crown, making it suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge that adds visual interest. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>While it is less hardy than the common ash, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
