                    <h1>Festuca sublimis</h1>
<p>Festuca sublimis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its fine, needle-like leaves are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>Festuca sublimis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
