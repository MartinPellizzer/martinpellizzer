The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
