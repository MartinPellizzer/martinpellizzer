                    <h1>Ficus carica var. grassensis</h1>
<p>Ficus carica var. grassensis, commonly known as the Grassensis fig, is a variant of the common fig tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within its syconium, a unique structure that houses the fig's true flowers. The fruit, which develops from the syconium, is usually small and edible, though it may vary in size and taste compared to the common fig.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
