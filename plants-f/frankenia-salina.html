                    <h1>Frankenia salina</h1>
<p>Frankenia salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Frankenia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
