                    <h1>Fumanopsis</h1>
<p>Fumanopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ethereal appearance with delicate, pale green or white petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often resembling a ghostly silhouette against the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Fumanopsis is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
