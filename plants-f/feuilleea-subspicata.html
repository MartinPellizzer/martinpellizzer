                    <h1>Feuilleea subspicata</h1>
<p>Feuilleea subspicata, commonly known as the silverleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Feuilleea subspicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
