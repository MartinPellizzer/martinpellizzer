                    <h1>Fumana ericoides f. typica</h1>
<p>Fumana ericoides f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the alpine heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is a common component of high-altitude vegetation.</p>
