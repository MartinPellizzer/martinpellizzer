                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. glabra</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry, and rocky habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with short, smooth hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
