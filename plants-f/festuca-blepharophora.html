                    <h1>Festuca blepharophora</h1>
<p>Festuca blepharophora, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats that help prevent erosion. Its slender, spike-like inflorescence bears small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Festuca blepharophora is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in harsh environments.</p>
