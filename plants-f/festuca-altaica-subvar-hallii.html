                    <h1>Festuca altaica subvar. hallii</h1>
<p>Festuca altaica subvar. hallii, commonly known as the Altai fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which contain the flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
