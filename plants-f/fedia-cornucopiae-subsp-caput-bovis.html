<p>Fedia cornucopiae subsp.</p>
<p>caput-bovis, commonly known as the horned abundance fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble a bull's horn, giving it its distinctive common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds, and it exhibits a unique growth pattern with a central stem that branches into multiple fleshy, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
