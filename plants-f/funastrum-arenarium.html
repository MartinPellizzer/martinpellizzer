<p>Funastrum arenarium, commonly known as the sand funastrum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Funastrum arenarium is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
