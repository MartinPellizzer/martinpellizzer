                    <h1>Festuca dura var. pubifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca dura var. pubifolia, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and grazing.</p>
<p>Festuca dura var. pubifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
