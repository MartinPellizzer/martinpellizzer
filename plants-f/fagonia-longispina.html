                    <h1>Fagonia longispina</h1>
<p>Fagonia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti, and is characterized by its succulent stems and spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Fagonia longispina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
