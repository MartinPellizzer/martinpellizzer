<p>Festuca unilateralis subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is typically found in dune systems and salt marshes along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
