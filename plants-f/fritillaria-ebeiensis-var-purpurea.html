<p>Fritillaria ebeiensis var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple belladonna lily, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
