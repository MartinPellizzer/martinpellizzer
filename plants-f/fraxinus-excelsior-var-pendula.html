                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. pendula</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. pendula, commonly known as weeping ash, is a cultivar of the common ash tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often planted in gardens and parks, though it is susceptible to ash dieback disease.</p>
