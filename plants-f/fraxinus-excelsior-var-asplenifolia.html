                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifolium ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble those of the fern *Asplenium*.</p>
<p>This species is native to western Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland habitats. Its leaves are typically narrower and more deeply lobed than those of the standard *Fraxinus excelsior*, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
