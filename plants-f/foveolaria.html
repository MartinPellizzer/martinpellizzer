                    <h1>Foveolaria</h1>
<p>Foveolaria, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that belongs to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structure and is typically found in marine environments. Foveolaria thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the water.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
