                    <h1>Fagonia viscida</h1>
<p>Fagonia viscida, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, resinous coating that gives it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Fagonia viscida is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
