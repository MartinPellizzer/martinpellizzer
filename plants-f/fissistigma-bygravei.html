<p>Fissistigma bygravei, commonly known as the Bygrave's fissistigma, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often branched stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fissistigma bygravei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
