<p>Festuca asperrima, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, stiff leaves and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, where it forms dense mats that help prevent erosion. Festuca asperrima is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to low-nutrient environments and extreme weather conditions.</p>
