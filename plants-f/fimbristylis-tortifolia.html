                    <h1>Fimbristylis tortifolia</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis tortifolia, commonly known as the hairy flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with standing water or high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its hairy texture on the leaves and stems, which distinguishes it from similar species in the genus.</p>
