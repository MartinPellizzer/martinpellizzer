                    <h1>Fagonia isotricha var. crassissima</h1>
<p>Fagonia isotricha var. crassissima, commonly known as the thick-bracted fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, gray-green leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
