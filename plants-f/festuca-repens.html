                    <h1>Festuca repens</h1>
<p>Festuca repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in lawns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Festuca repens is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
