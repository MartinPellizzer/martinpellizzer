<p>Fimbristylis alata, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis alata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
