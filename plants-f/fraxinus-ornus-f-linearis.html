                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus f. linearis</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus f. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a botanical variant of the common ash.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Fraxinus ornus. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and is often found in drier, more exposed habitats. The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
