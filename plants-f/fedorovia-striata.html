<p>Fedorovia striata, commonly known as the stripeleaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and its distinctive, strap-like leaves that are marked with prominent white or pale green stripes. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like inflorescences that produce both male and female cones.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
