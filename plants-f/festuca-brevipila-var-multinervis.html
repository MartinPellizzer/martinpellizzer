                    <h1>Festuca brevipila var. multinervis</h1>
<p>Festuca brevipila var. multinervis, commonly known as the multivenous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. The plant typically forms dense mats, with inflorescences consisting of spikelets that are often clustered in tufts. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a distinct venation pattern, contributing to its scientific name.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential horticultural applications.</p>
