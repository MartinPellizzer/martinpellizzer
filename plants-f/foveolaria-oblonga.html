                    <h1>Foveolaria oblonga</h1>
<p>Foveolaria oblonga, commonly known as the oblong sponge or the sponge anemone, is a species of hexactinellid sponge found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and a delicate, porous structure composed of silica-based spicules. The sponge's body is covered with a thin, transparent layer called the periderm, which provides protection. Foveolaria oblonga typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in marine ecosystems.</p>
