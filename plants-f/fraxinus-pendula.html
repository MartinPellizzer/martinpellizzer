                    <h1>Fraxinus pendula</h1>
<p>Fraxinus pendula, commonly known as weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing, making it a popular choice for landscaping.</p>
