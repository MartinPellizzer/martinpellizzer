                    <h1>Fagus purpurea tricolor</h1>
<p>Fagus purpurea tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored beech, is a rare and striking variant of the beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, which displays three distinct colors—green, purple, and white—on the same leaf. This coloration is due to variations in chlorophyll distribution and pigmentation. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
