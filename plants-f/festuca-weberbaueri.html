<p>Festuca weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca weberbaueri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
