                    <h1>Ficinia radiata</h1>
<p>Ficinia radiata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves that resemble a fern, with a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are composed of numerous small, overlapping segments called pinnae, which contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Ficinia radiata is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds.</p>
