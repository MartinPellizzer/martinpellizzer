<p>Festuca × polovina, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species that is widely cultivated for its ornamental and forage value.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Festuca arundinacea and Festuca ovina, resulting in a plant with robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions.
