                <h1>Festuca arvensis</h1>
<p>Festuca arvensis, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats.</p>
<p>Festuca arvensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
