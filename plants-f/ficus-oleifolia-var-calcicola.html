<p>Ficus oleifolia var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fig, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, often in association with limestone formations. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by edible fig-like fruits that provide sustenance to local wildlife.</p>
