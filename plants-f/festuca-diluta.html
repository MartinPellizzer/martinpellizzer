                    <h1>Festuca diluta</h1>
<p>Festuca diluta, commonly known as slender fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Festuca diluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
