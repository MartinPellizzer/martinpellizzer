                    <h1>Ficaria ficarioides var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Ficaria ficarioides var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
