                    <h1>Fumaria confusa</h1>
<p>Fumaria confusa, commonly known as the common fumitory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fumaria confusa thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the smoky or smelly scent it emits when crushed, which is thought to be due to the presence of certain alkaloids.</p>
