<p>Fritillaria tachengensis var. nivea, commonly known as the snowflake fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a contrasting purple or brown base. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients for survival in its harsh environment.
