                    <h1>Festuca valesiaca f. viridis</h1>
<p>Festuca valesiaca f. viridis, commonly known as the green form of alpine fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it forms dense, mat-like growths.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in high-altitude gardens.</p>
