                    <h1>Fritillaria orsiniana</h1>
<p>Fritillaria orsiniana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
