<p>Festuca subbiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca subbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes.</p>
