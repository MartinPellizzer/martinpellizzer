<p>Festuca viviparoidea, commonly known as the viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca viviparoidea is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
