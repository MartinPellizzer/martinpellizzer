<p>Flanagania orangeana, commonly known as the orange-flowered flanagania, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange blossoms that bloom in clusters, adding a splash of color to its dense canopy. The plant has a woody stem with rough, bark-like texture and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are not only visually appealing but also attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Flanagania orangeana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
