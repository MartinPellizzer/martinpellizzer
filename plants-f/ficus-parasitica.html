                    <h1>Ficus parasitica</h1>
<p>Ficus parasitica, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical vine that begins its life as an epiphyte growing on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>Its roots descend from the host's canopy, eventually encircling the trunk and forming a dense, woody structure around it. As the plant grows, it can completely envelop the host tree, often leading to its death. The plant's aerial roots absorb water and nutrients from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Ficus parasitica is a striking example of a hemi-parasitic plant that plays a significant role in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
