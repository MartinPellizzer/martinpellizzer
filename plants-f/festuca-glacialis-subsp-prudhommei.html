<p>Festuca glacialis subsp.</p>
<p>prudhommei, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
