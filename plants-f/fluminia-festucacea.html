                    <h1>Fluminia festucacea</h1>
<p>Fluminia festucacea, commonly known as rivergrass or water reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and floodplains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Fluminia festucacea plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
