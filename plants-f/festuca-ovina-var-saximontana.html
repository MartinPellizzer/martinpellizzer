                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. saximontana</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. saximontana, commonly known as mountain sheepgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is highly resistant to cold and drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
