<p>Ferocactus histrix, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that are often ribbed and covered in white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture quickly.</p>
<p>Ferocactus histrix is a slow-growing cactus that can reach heights of up to 3 feet, making it a striking addition to desert landscapes.</p>
