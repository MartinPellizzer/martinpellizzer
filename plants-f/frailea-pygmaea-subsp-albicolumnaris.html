<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>albicolumnaris, commonly known as the white-columned fairy cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a whitish, powdery coating that gives it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
