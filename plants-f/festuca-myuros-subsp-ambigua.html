<p>Festuca myuros subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua, commonly known as the slender meadow fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
