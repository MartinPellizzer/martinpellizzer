<p>Festuca alpina var. briquetii, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
