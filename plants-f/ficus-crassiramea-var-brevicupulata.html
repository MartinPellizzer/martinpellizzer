                    <h1>Ficus crassiramea var. brevicupulata</h1>
<p>Ficus crassiramea var. brevicupulata, commonly known as the short-cupped fig tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, turning yellow or red depending on the variety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
