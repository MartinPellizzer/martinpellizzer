                    <h1>Frankenia pauciflora var. trichosticha</h1>
<p>Frankenia pauciflora var. trichosticha, commonly known as the coastal frangipani, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a common sight along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
