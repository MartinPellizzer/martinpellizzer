                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. obtusata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf ash, is a variant of the European ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen sharp-lobed leaves of the typical Fraxinus excelsior. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
