                    <h1>Forrestia irritans</h1>
<p>Forrestia irritans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rapid leaf movement is due to specialized cells called pulvini, which adjust turgor pressure in response to stimuli.</p>
<p>While it is often grown as an ornamental plant, it is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
