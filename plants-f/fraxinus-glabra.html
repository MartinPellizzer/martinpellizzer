<p>Fraxinus glabra, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in drooping clusters in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
