                    <h1>Fumaria meyeri</h1>
<p>Fumaria meyeri, commonly known as the yellow weed or lesser celandine, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
