                    <h1>Festuca acerosa</h1>
<p>Festuca acerosa, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought and grazing makes it a common component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>Festuca acerosa is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop in some agricultural settings.</p>
