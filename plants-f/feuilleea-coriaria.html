                    <h1>Feuilleea coriaria</h1>
<p>Feuilleea coriaria, commonly known as the wrinkled leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, corky layer that provides additional protection against extreme temperatures and drought.</p>
<p>Feuilleea coriaria is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
