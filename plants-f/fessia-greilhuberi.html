<p>Fessia greilhuberi, commonly known as the Greilhuber's fessia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other fessia species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
