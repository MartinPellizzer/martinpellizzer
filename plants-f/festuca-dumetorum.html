                    <h1>Festuca dumetorum</h1>
<p>Festuca dumetorum, commonly known as poisongrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to livestock due to the presence of the alkaloid festuca, making it a concern in grazing areas.</p>
