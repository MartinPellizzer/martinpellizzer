<p>Festuca ophioliticola subsp.</p>
<p>armoricana, commonly known as the Armorican bentgrass, is a rare and specialized grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
