<p>Fusifilum montanum, commonly known as the mountain spindle tree, is a woody plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spindle-shaped trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by clusters of red berries. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Fusifilum montanum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
