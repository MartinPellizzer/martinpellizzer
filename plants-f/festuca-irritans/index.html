                            <h1>Festuca Irritans</h1>
<p>Fescue grass, scientifically known as Festuca irritans, is a hardy perennial grass commonly found in temperate regions around the world. This resilient plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its dense growth pattern makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping. Despite its benefits, Fescue grass can sometimes pose challenges due to its aggressive spreading habit. Overall, it remains an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
