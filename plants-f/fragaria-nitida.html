                    <h1>Fragaria nitida</h1>
<p>Fragaria nitida, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are similar in taste to cultivated strawberries but are typically less sweet and more tart. Fragaria nitida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical gardens.</p>
