                    <h1>Fimbristylis paupercula</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis paupercula, commonly known as the poor grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils, making it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
