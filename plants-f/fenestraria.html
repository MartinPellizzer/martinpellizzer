<p>Fenestraria, commonly known as the "earthy star" or "window plant," is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, fleshy, and often translucent leaves that resemble windows, hence their common name. Fenestraria species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They produce delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
