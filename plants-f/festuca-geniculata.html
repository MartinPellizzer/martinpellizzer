                <h1>Festuca geniculata</h1>
<p>Festuca geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and often forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats.</p>
<p>Festuca geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
