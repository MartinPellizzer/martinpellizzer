                    <h1>Fragaria × grandiflora</h1>
<p>Fragaria × grandiflora, commonly known as the everbearing strawberry, is a hybrid species that combines traits from both wild and cultivated strawberries.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its semi-erect growth habit and the production of small, edible fruits that ripen over multiple seasons. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15–20 cm, with trifoliate leaves and white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits, while smaller than those of the common garden strawberry, are prized for their flavor and nutritional value.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for home gardeners.</p>
