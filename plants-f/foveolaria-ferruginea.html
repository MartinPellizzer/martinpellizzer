<p>Foveolaria ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored sponge.</p>
<p>It is a species of demosponge found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. The sponge's body is characterized by a dense network of spongin fibers and siliceous spicules, which provide structural support. Its coloration often ranges from pale yellow to reddish-brown, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Foveolaria ferruginea plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
