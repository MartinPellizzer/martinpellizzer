                    <h1>Fragariastrum discipulorum</h1>
<p>Fragariastrum discipulorum, commonly known as the "student strawberry," is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are typically smaller and less flavorful. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
