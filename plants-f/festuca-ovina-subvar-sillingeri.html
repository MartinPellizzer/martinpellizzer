<p>Festuca ovina subvar. sillingeri, commonly known as the Sillinger's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in gardens.</p>
