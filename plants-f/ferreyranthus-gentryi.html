                    <h1>Ferreyranthus gentryi</h1>
<p>Ferreyranthus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant is distinguished by its pale blue to white petals and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ferreyranthus gentryi is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
