                    <h1>Fraxinus americana var. curtissii</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana var. curtissii, commonly known as Curtiss' white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical white ash. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests.</p>
