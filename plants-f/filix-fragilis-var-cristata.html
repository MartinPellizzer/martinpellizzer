                    <h1>Filix fragilis var. cristata</h1>
<p>Filix fragilis var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate fern, is a variegated cultivar of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, frilly, and lace-like fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The variegation in its fronds is due to a genetic mutation that results in the loss of chlorophyll in certain areas.</p>
