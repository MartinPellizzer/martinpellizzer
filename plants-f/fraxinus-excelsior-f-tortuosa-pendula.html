                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. tortuosa-pendula</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. tortuosa-pendula, commonly known as the twisted weeping ash, is a unique form of the common ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its contorted, twisted branches that cascade in a weeping manner, creating an ornamental and visually striking appearance. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its distinctive form and aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
