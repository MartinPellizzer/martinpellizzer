                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The tree has opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that are usually 5–12 centimeters long. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability.</p>
