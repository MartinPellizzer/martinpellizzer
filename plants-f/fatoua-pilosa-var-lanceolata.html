                    <h1>Fatoua pilosa var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Fatoua pilosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fatoua, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Fatoua pilosa var. lanceolata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
