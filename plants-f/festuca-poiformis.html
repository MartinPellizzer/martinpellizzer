                    <h1>Festuca poiformis</h1>
<p>Festuca poiformis, commonly known as the mountain festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky slopes effectively.</p>
<p>Festuca poiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
