                    <h1>Festuca rupicola f. supinoides</h1>
<p>Festuca rupicola f. supinoides, commonly known as the rock grass or cushion grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitude, poor soil, and extreme temperatures. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, stabilizing soil in rocky areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada.</p>
