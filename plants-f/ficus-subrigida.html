                    <h1>Ficus subrigida</h1>
<p>Ficus subrigida, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible for certain animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus subrigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>
