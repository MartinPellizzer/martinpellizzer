<p>Ficus krishnae, commonly known as Krishna's fig, is a rare and unique species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ficus krishnae is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
