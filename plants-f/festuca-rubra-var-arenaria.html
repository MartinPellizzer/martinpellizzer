                    <h1>Festuca rubra var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra var. arenaria, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, dark green blades and forms dense, mat-like growth, which helps stabilize sandy or rocky soils. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Sandy fescue is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion.</p>
