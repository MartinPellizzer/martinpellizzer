<p>Freycinetia loheri, commonly known as the Lohrer's screw pine, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Tonga.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freycinetia loheri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
