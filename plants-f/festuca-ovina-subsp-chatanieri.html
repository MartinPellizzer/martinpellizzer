<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>chatanieri, commonly known as Chatanier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats.</p>
