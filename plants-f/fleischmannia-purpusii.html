                    <h1>Fleischmannia purpusii</h1>
<p>Fleischmannia purpusii, commonly known as the desert globe cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny stems, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, and its shallow root system allows it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Fleischmannia purpusii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
