<p>Festuca octoflora, commonly known as the eight-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Festuca octoflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
