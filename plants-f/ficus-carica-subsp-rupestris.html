<p>Ficus carica subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a subspecies of the common fig that is adapted to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, lobed leaves and the ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less abundant than those of the common fig. It is often found in Mediterranean regions and has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
