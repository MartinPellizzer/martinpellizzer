<p>Furcraea stricta, commonly known as the sword plant or narrow-leaf aloe, is a perennial succulent native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It features tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that are dark green with a waxy coating, adapted for water retention in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its architectural form and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves are also used in traditional medicine and for making fiber.</p>
