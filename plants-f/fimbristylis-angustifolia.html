                    <h1>Fimbristylis angustifolia</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf basket grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hair-covered, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white or pale flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with suitable climates.</p>
