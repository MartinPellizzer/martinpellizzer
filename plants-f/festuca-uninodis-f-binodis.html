                    <h1>Festuca uninodis f. binodis</h1>
<p>Festuca uninodis f. binodis, commonly known as the two-node fescue, is a variant of the common fescue species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-node structure in the culms, which sets it apart from the typical single-node form. This grass is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
