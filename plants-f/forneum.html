                    <h1>Forneum</h1>
<p>Forneum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost spectral in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, cold air.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme habitat requirements, Forneum is considered endangered and is rarely found in cultivation.</p>
