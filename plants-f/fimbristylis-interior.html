<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, lake margins, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
