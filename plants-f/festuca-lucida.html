                    <h1>Festuca lucida</h1>
<p>Festuca lucida, commonly known as shining fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca lucida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
