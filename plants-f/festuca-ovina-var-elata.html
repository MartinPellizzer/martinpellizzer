<p>Festuca ovina var. elata, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina var. elata is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
