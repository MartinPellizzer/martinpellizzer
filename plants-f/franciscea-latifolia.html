                    <h1>Franciscea latifolia</h1>
<p>Franciscea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf francesca, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other shrubs such as blueberries and azaleas.</p>
