                    <h1>Fagonia densa</h1>
<p>Fagonia densa, commonly known as the dense fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Fagonia densa produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat.</p>
