                    <h1>Farfara radiata</h1>
<p>Farfara radiata, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Farfara radiata is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
