<p>Festuca heptantha, commonly known as the seven-veined fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct venation patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca heptantha is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
