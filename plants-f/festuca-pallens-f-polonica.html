<p>Festuca pallens f. polonica, commonly known as the Polish meadow fescue, is a hemicryptophyte grass species native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows in moist to wet meadows and along stream banks, thriving in partially shaded to sunny conditions. It has a clump-forming habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a single spike or a few spikes, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
