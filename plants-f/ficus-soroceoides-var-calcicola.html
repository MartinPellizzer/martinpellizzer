                    <h1>Ficus soroceoides var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Ficus soroceoides var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fig, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, which gives it its specific epithet "calcicola.".</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
