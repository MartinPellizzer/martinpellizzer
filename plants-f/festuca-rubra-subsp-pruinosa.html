<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>pruinosa, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage covered in a waxy coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
