                    <h1>Fernandezia amboroensis var. amboroensis</h1>
<p>Fernandezia amboroensis var. amboroensis, commonly known as the Amboro fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, showcasing its adaptation to high-altitude conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
