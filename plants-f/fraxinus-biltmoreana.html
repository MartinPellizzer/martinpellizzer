<p>Fraxinus biltmoreana, commonly known as the Biltmore ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age.</p>
<p>The Biltmore ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
