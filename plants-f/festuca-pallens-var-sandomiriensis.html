<p>Festuca pallens var. sandomiriensis, commonly known as the Sandomirian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a silvery-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
