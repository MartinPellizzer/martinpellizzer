                    <h1>Frankenia lignosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia lignosa, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia lignosa is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in dunes and coastal habitats.</p>
