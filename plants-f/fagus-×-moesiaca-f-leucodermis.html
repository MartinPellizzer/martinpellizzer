<p>Fagus × moesiaca f. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-barked beech, is a unique variant of the European beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white or pale bark, which contrasts sharply with its dark green foliage. This form is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Fagus sylvatica and Fagus orientalis. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
