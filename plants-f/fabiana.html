                    <h1>Fabiana</h1>
<p>Fabiana, commonly known as the "fairy lantern" or "false heather," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often resemble lanterns. Fabiana species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Fabiana parviflora, which is popular for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
