<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and pastureland.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant of both drought and moderate shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its deep green foliage and reddish tinge during the growing season.</p>
