                    <h1>Fernandezia ecallosa</h1>
<p>Fernandezia ecallosa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, smooth cuticle. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Fernandezia ecallosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in protected botanical gardens.</p>
