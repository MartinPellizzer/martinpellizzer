The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit ripens in late summer, turning red with a sweet, aromatic flavor.</p>
<p>Fragaria verna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of seeds for growing true strawberries.</p>
