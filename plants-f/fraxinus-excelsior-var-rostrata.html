<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata ash, is a variant of the common ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elongated buds, which give it its specific epithet "rostrata," meaning "beak-like.". The leaves are typically opposite, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shady habitats.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
