                    <h1>Freycinetia kurziana</h1>
<p>Freycinetia kurziana, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their bright red color, which serves as an attractant for seed dispersers. Freycinetia kurziana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a living fossil, providing insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
