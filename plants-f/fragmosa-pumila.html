<p>Fragmosa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf fragmosa, is a low-growing shrub native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade.</p>
