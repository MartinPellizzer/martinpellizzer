                    <h1>Ferocactus wislizeni var. phoeniceus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus wislizeni var. phoeniceus, commonly known as the red-tipped barrel cactus, is a desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through shade.</p>
<p>The variety phoeniceus is distinguished by its reddish coloration at the tips of the stems, which can vary depending on light exposure and environmental conditions.</p>
