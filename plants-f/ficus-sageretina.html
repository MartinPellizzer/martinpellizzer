<p>Ficus sageretina, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Its fruit, a small, greenish fig, is edible but typically not consumed by humans due to its mild bitterness.</p>
<p>Ficus sageretina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments.</p>
