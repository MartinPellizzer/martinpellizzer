                    <h1>Fissia mutica</h1>
<p>Fissia mutica, commonly known as the sticky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Fissia mutica is notable for its sticky, resinous substance, which helps it adhere to its host and may also deter herbivores.</p>
