                    <h1>Feuilleea montana</h1>
<p>Feuilleea montana, commonly known as the Alpine Leaf Plant, is a rare perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale blue and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soil, while its stems are woody at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
