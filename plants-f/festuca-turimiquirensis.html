<p>Festuca turimiquirensis, commonly known as the Turimiquire fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or semi-arid habitats. Festuca turimiquirensis is adapted to cold and dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of high-altitude grasslands and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
