                    <h1>Fagelia nevadensis</h1>
<p>Fagelia nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Nevada, USA.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Fagelia nevadensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
