                    <h1>Festuca ovina proles glauca</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina proles glauca, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or greenish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
