<p>Fritzschia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile fritzschia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fritzschia sessilis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
