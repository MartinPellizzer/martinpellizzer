<p>Festuca pseudomyuros, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Festuca pseudomyuros is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns in arid environments.</p>
