<p>Ficus brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique, round, green fig fruits that are typically consumed by birds and mammals. Ficus brachypoda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its propagation is mainly through vegetative means, such as stem cuttings, due to its low seed viability.</p>
