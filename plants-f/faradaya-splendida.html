                    <h1>Faradaya splendida</h1>
<p>Faradaya splendida, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped blossom, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them, and they absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
