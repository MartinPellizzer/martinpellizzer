<p>Festuca marginata subsp.</p>
<p>alopecuroides, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it withstand salty air and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, thriving in coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
