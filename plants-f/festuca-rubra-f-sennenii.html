                    <h1>Festuca rubra f. sennenii</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra f. sennenii, commonly known as the red fescue silvergrass, is a cool-season grass that exhibits a distinctive silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often found in moist, acidic soils, particularly in woodland and heathland habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
