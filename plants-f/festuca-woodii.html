                    <h1>Festuca woodii</h1>
<p>Festuca woodii, commonly known as Wood's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca woodii is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
