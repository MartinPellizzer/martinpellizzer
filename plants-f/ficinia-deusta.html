                    <h1>Ficinia deusta</h1>
<p>Ficinia deusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
