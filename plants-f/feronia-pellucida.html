                    <h1>Feronia pellucida</h1>
<p>Feronia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy feronia, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Feronia pellucida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
