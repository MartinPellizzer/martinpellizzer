<p>Fagonia indica var. subinermis, commonly known as the Indian fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
