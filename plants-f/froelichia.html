                    <h1>Froelichia</h1>
<p>Froelichia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Froelichia species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
