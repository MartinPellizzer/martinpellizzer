                    <h1>Faurea forficuliflora var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Faurea forficuliflora var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved faurea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its woody stems are often twisted and branched, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
