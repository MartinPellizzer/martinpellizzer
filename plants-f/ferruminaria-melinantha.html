<p>Ferruminaria melinantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in sandy soils near the coast, where it thrives in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are small and clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Ferruminaria melinantha is now listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
