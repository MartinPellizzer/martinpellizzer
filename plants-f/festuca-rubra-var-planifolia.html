<p>Festuca rubra var. planifolia, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and landscaping due to its drought tolerance and fine texture.</p>
<p>Festuca rubra var. planifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns.</p>
