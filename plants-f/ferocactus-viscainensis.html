<p>Ferocactus viscainensis, commonly known as the viscainensis barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a spiny, protective covering. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by fleshy, red fruits. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Ferocactus viscainensis is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
