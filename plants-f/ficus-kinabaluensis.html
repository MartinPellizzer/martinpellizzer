<p>Ficus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fig, is a species of fig tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in montane forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. It produces small, green fig fruits that are enclosed in a syconium, a unique structure that houses the tiny flowers and developing seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various animals and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
