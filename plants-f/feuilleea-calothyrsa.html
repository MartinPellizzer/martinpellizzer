                    <h1>Feuilleea calothyrsa</h1>
<p>Feuilleea calothyrsa, commonly known as the silverleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, round, woody蒴果. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
