                            <h1>Filago Germanica Subsp. Pyramidata</h1>
<p>German hawkweed, scientifically known as Filago germanica subsp. pyramidata, is a striking plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, cylindrical stems that stand upright. This subspecies thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in regional flora. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more commonly cultivated plants.</p>
