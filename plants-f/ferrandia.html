<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often divided into several lobes, and their showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Ferrandia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>They also play a role in traditional medicine and local ecosystems in their native habitats.</p>
