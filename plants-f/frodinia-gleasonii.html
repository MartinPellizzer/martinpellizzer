<p>Frodinia gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's frodinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a soft, hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Frodinia gleasonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
