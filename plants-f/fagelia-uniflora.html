<p>Fagelia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower fagelia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. Fagelia uniflora thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
