                    <h1>Ficus cereicarpa var. ashtonii</h1>
<p>Ficus cereicarpa var. ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's fig.</p>
<p>It is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the Ficus genus, characterized by its unique leaf morphology and fruiting habits. The plant typically features glossy, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often found in specialized botanical collections rather than in mainstream horticulture.</p>
