<p>Frankenia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate saline conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia latifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
