                    <h1>Fagonia parviflora var. brevispina</h1>
<p>Fagonia parviflora var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its harsh, dry environment. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces fruit that is often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
