                    <h1>Fraxinus cavekiana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus cavekiana, commonly known as the cave ash, is a rare and little-known species of ash tree native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, ovate leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its fruits are samaras, which have a winged structure to aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fraxinus cavekiana is considered an endangered species.</p>
