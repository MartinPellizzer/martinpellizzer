                    <h1>Fritillaria ehrhartii var. prasinantha</h1>
<p>Fritillaria ehrhartii var. prasinantha, commonly known as the green-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves and its most notable feature: its bright green flowers, which are typically bell-shaped and lack the typical orange or red hues seen in other fritillary species. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, each with a distinctive, waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
