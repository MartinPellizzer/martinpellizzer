                    <h1>Furcilla</h1>
<p>Furcilla, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that split into two distinct branches, giving it its common name. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Furcilla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
