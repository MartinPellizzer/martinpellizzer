<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth to the touch, as the name suggests. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
