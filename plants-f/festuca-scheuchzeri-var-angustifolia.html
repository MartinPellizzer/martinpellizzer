The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
