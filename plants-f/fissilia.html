                    <h1>Fissilia</h1>
<p>Fissilia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as rocky substrates, cliffs, and tree bark, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Fissilia exhibits a variety of growth forms, including crustose, foliose, and fruticose, depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
