                    <h1>Ficus pyrifolia var. melleri</h1>
<p>Ficus pyrifolia var. melleri, commonly known as the Meller's fig, is a rare and specialized variant of the fig tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a waxy surface and a distinctive, almost triangular shape. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
