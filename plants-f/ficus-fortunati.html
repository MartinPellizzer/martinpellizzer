<p>Ficus fortunati, commonly known as the Fortune's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits, though these are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus fortunati is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
