<p>Ferocactus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden fishhook cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its bright yellow to orange spines and a distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, which help stabilize desert soils and provide habitat for various desert species.</p>
