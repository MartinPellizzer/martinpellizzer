                    <h1>Festuca heterophylla var. erecta</h1>
<p>Festuca heterophylla var. erecta, commonly known as the upright bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental use. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and forms dense, mat-like clumps. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
