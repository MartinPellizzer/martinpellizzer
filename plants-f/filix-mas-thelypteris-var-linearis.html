                    <h1>Filix-mas thelypteris var. linearis</h1>
<p>Filix-mas thelypteris var. linearis, commonly known as the linear fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, linear fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid conditions.</p>
