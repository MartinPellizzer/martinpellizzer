                    <h1>Ficus carica var. tournefortiana</h1>
<p>Ficus carica var. tournefortiana, commonly known as the Smyrna fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ornamental leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia, which are unique to the Moraceae family. The fruit, a fig, develops within the syconium and is typically harvested when it turns a deep purple or black color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage rather than its fruit.</p>
