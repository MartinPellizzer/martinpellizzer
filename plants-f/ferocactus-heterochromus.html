<p>Ferocactus heterochromus, commonly known as the variegated barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ferocactus heterochromus is well adapted to desert environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
