                    <h1>Fimbristylis metzii</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis metzii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis metzii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas.</p>
