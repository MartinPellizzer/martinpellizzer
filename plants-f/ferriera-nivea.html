<p>Ferriera nivea, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, silvery-white foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its fronds are typically short and compact, forming a low, cushion-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ferriera nivea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
