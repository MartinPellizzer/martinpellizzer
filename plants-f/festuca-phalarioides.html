                    <h1>Festuca phalarioides</h1>
<p>Festuca phalarioides, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in saline and windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, dunes, and coastal grasslands. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Festuca phalarioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
