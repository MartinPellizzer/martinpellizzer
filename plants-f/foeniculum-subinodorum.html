                    <h1>Foeniculum subinodorum</h1>
<p>Foeniculum subinodorum, commonly known as the slender fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its aromatic seeds are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to common fennel.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than its more well-known relative, Foeniculum vulgare.</p>
