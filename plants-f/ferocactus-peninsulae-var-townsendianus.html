                    <h1>Ferocactus peninsulae var. townsendianus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus peninsulae var. townsendianus, commonly known as Townsend's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert region of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its spiny exterior provides protection from herbivores and helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to extreme temperatures and can thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
