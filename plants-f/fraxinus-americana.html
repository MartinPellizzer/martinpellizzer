                <h1>Fraxinus americana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 9 to 15 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured and scaly with age.</p>
<p>The white ash is valued for its strong, straight-grained wood, which has been used historically for furniture and sports equipment.</p>
