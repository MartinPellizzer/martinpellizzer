<p>Faujasiopsis flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>bourbonensis, commonly known as the Bourbon fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
