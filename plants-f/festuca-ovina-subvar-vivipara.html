<p>Festuca ovina subvar. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the ability to produce viable seeds on the parent plant, a trait known as viviparity. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
