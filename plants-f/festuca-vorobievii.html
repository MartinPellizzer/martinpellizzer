<p>Festuca vorobievii, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in temperate and cold climates.</p>
<p>Festuca vorobievii is often used in ornamental gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience.</p>
