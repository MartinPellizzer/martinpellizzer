<p>Ferocactus crispatus, commonly known as the cactus hound, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny ribs that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>Ferocactus crispatus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
