                    <h1>Festuca gracillima var. monticola</h1>
<p>Festuca gracillima var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>
