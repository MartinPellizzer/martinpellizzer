<p>Festuca duernsteinensis, commonly known as the Duernstein fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Festuca duernsteinensis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
