                    <h1>Ferula latifolia</h1>
<p>Ferula latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence, which blooms in the spring. Its roots are thick and fleshy, storing nutrients and water, which allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ferula latifolia is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
