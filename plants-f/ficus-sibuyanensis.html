<p>Ficus sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, and it relies on specific fig wasps for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
