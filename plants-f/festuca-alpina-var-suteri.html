<p>Festuca alpina var. suteri, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with harsh climates.</p>
