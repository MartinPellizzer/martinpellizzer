<p>Fraxinus anomala subsp.</p>
<p>lowellii, commonly known as the lowellii ash, is a rare subspecies native to the western United States. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats, making it an important component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
