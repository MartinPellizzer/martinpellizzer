                    <h1>Ficus carica var. sylvestris</h1>
<p>Ficus carica var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, often thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more coarsely toothed than those of the common fig. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are usually smaller and less sweet than those of cultivated varieties. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>This wild form is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
