<p>Festuca pumila subsp.</p>
<p>eskia, commonly known as the Eskimo grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
