                    <h1>Ficus hartwegii var. tumacana</h1>
<p>Ficus hartwegii var. tumacana, commonly known as the Desert Fig, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert landscapes.</p>
