<p>Ferocactus cylindraceus, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its spines are typically yellow to brown, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Ferocactus cylindraceus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
