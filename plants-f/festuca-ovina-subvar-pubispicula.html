                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. pubispicula</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. pubispicula, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
