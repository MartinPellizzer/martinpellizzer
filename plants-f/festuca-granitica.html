<p>Festuca granitica, commonly known as granitic fescue, is a hardy perennial grass native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca granitica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes.</p>
