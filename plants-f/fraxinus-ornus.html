                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, typically turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>
