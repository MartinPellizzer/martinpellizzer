                    <h1>Fritillaria gawleri</h1>
<p>Fritillaria gawleri, commonly known as the Kashmirian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting black markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its cold, arid environment. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Fritillaria gawleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
