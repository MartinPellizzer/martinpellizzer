                    <h1>Festuca borealis</h1>
<p>Festuca borealis, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca borealis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing food for herbivores and contributing to soil structure.</p>
