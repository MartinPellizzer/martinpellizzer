                    <h1>Fimbristylis complanata var. kraussiana</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis complanata var. kraussiana, commonly known as the flat-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
