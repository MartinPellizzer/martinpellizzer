<p>Fagonia deflexa, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps that provide habitat for small animals. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Fagonia deflexa is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
