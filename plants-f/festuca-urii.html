<p>Festuca urii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Festuca urii has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
