<p>Festuca rubra subvar. villiflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. It has a high tolerance for cold temperatures and is often used in lawns and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dark green foliage and the production of small, reddish-brown seed heads.</p>
