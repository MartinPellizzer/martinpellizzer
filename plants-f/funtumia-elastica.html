                    <h1>Funtumia elastica</h1>
<p>Funtumia elastica, commonly known as the rubber tree or African rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap, which is similar to natural rubber, has been historically used for various industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Funtumia elastica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
