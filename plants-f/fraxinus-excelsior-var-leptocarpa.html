                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. leptocarpa</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically lighter green than those of the typical common ash. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaved ash is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks, contributing to biodiversity in these habitats.</p>
