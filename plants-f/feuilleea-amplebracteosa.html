                    <h1>Feuilleea amplebracteosa</h1>
<p>Feuilleea amplebracteosa, commonly known as the broad-bract feuillea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white. These flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Feuilleea amplebracteosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and resilience to drought conditions.</p>
