                    <h1>Forsgardia</h1>
<p>Forsgardia, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Forsgardia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Andean medicine.</p>
