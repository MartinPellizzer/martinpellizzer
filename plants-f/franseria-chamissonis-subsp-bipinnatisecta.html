<p>Franseria chamissonis subsp.</p>
<p>bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved franseria, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
