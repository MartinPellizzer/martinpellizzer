                    <h1>Faurea decipiens var. katangensis</h1>
<p>Faurea decipiens var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga faurea, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>This shrub is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with smooth, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
