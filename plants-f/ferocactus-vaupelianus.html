<p>Ferocactus vaupelianus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that grow in a rounded, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ferocactus vaupelianus is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
