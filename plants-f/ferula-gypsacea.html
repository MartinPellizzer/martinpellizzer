<p>Ferula gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum ferula, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often containing a resinous sap that has been used traditionally in some cultures.</p>
<p>Ferula gypsacea is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
