                    <h1>Fingardia nephroglossa</h1>
<p>Fingardia nephroglossa, commonly known as the kidney-tongue plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
