                    <h1>Felicia cymbalariae</h1>
<p>Felicia cymbalariae, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, fleshy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cyme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Felicia cymbalariae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
