                    <h1>Ficus duquei var. obtusiloba</h1>
<p>Ficus duquei var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a variant of the Ficus duquei species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard Ficus duquei. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variant is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>
