                    <h1>Festuca rubra var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra var. uliginosa, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple or reddish hues in its foliage, which become more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
