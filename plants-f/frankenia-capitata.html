<p>Frankenia capitata, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia capitata is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion.</p>
