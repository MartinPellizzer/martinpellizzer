                    <h1>Festuca cinerea f. pubiculmis</h1>
<p>Festuca cinerea f. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent silvergrass, is a variant of the silvergrass species Festuca cinerea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its distinctive pubescence, which distinguishes it from other forms of Festuca cinerea.</p>
