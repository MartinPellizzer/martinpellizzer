                    <h1>Faucaria speciosa</h1>
<p>Faucaria speciosa, commonly known as the Ice Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
