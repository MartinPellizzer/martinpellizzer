                    <h1>Festuca minor</h1>
<p>Festuca minor, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca minor is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its aesthetic appeal in natural and cultivated settings.</p>
