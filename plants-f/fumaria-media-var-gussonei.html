                    <h1>Fumaria media var. gussonei</h1>
<p>Fumaria media var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's celandine, is a variant of the common celandine, characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of the standard fumaria, with potential use in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
