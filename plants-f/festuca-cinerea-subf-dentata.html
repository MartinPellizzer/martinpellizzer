<p>Festuca cinerea subf.</p>
<p>dentata, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, typically bearing small, pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in wetland and grassland habitats.</p>
