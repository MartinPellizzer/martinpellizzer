<p>Fagus sylvatica f. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf beech, is a unique variant of the European beech.</p>

This form occurs naturally in certain regions of Europe, often in areas with specific soil and climate conditions. The leaves turn a striking yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a notable addition to woodland landscapes.</p>
