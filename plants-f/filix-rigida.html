<p>Filix rigida, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright, sparsely branched fronds. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a serrated margin and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
