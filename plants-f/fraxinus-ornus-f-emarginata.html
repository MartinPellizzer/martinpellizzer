<p>Fraxinus ornus f. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginated weeping ash, is a unique variant of the weeping ash tree.</p>
<p>This form exhibits distinctive leaf morphology, characterized by notched or emarginated leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical species. It is a deciduous tree that produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged samaras. The plant is native to parts of Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful, weeping appearance.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies.</p>
