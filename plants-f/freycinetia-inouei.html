<p>Freycinetia inouei, commonly known as the Hainan freycinetia, is a rare cycad species native to the Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, ellipsoid seeds. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
