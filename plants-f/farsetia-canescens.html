<p>Farsetia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf farsetia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
