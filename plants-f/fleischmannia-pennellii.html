<p>Fleischmannia pennellii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though it contains mild toxins.</p>
