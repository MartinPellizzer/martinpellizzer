<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from its rough-leaved counterpart. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
