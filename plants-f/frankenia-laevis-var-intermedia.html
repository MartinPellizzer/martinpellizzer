                    <h1>Frankenia laevis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Frankenia laevis var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high salinity environments. The plant features small, fleshy, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are specialized for water storage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is often found in maritime habitats.</p>
