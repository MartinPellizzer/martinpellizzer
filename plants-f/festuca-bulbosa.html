                    <h1>Festuca bulbosa</h1>
<p>Festuca bulbosa, commonly known as bulbous fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca bulbosa is often found in rocky or alpine environments due to its tolerance for cold and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in mountainous areas.</p>
