<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>ticinensis, commonly known as Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats.</p>
