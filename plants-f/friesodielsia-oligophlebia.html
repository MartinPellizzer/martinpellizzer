The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
