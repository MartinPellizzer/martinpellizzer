<p>Festuca baffinensis, commonly known as Baffin's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Festuca baffinensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
