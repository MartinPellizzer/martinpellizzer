                    <h1>Festuca kolymensis</h1>
<p>Festuca kolymensis, commonly known as Kolyma fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, dark green foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca kolymensis thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme temperatures makes it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
