                    <h1>Festuca alpina</h1>
<p>Festuca alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong winds. Festuca alpina is often found in meadows, tundra, and slopes above the tree line.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
