                    <h1>Frasera induta</h1>
<p>Frasera induta, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gelsemiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically white or pale green, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake since it cannot perform photosynthesis. Frasera induta is a short-lived perennial, with a delicate structure that makes it easily overlooked in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for studies on plant-fungi interactions and ecological adaptations.</p>
