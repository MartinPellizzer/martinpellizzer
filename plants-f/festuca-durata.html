                    <h1>Festuca durata</h1>
<p>Festuca durata, commonly known as desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca durata is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a hardy species for restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
