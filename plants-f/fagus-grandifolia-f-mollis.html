                    <h1>Fagus grandifolia f. mollis</h1>
<p>Fagus grandifolia f. mollis, commonly known as the silky American beech, is a variant of the American beech tree characterized by its soft, silky texture on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique foliar morphology, with the lower leaf surfaces covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils under a canopy of hardwood trees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>While it shares the same basic structure as the typical American beech, the silky foliage makes it a distinctive and ornamental variety in botanical gardens and natural habitats.</p>
