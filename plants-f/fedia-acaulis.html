<p>Fedia acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Fedia acaulis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
