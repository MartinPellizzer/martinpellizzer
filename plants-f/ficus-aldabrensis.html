                    <h1>Ficus aldabrensis</h1>
<p>Ficus aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra ficus, is a species of fig tree native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is a small, slow-growing tree with thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to the arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, making it a resilient and unique botanical specimen.</p>
