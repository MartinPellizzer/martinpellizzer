                    <h1>Feuilleea dubia</h1>
<p>Feuilleea dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires a rich, well-draining soil substrate. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Feuilleea dubia remains a subject of botanical study and conservation interest.</p>
