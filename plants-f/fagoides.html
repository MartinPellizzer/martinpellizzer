                    <h1>Fagoides</h1>
<p>Fagoides, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water directly from the host through its haustoria. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>However, it can also weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
