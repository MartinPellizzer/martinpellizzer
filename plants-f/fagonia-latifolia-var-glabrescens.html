                    <h1>Fagonia latifolia var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Fagonia latifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green,革质 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
