                    <h1>Forstera uliginosa</h1>
<p>Forstera uliginosa, commonly known as the bog heather, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and closely packed, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Forstera uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
