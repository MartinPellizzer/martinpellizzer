                    <h1>Floydia</h1>
<p>Floydia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Restionaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly the Cape Province, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with small, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers. Floydia species are often found growing in open, sunny habitats and are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their low-growing form and unusual appearance, they are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
