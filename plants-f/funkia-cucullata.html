                    <h1>Funkia cucullata</h1>
<p>Funkia cucullata, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
