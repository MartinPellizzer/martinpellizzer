<p>Festuca sulcata subf.</p>
<p>hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, hairy florets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
