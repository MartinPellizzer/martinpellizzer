                    <h1>Festuca pinnata var. glabra</h1>
<p>Festuca pinnata var. glabra, commonly known as smooth meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
