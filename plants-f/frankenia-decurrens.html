<p>Frankenia decurrens, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia decurrens is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline.</p>
