                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. jumpeiana</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. jumpeiana, commonly known as the Jumpean sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers, contributing to its ecological importance in mountain ecosystems.</p>
