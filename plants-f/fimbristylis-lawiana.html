<p>Fimbristylis lawiana, commonly known as the silverhair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-gray appearance due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis lawiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
