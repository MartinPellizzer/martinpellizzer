                    <h1>Fernandezia pectinata</h1>
<p>Fernandezia pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Fernandezia pectinata plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>
