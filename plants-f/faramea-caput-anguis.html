<p>Faramea caput-anguis, commonly known as the "serpent's head" or "snake's head," is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo Basin. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, and it often grows in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>The plant has some traditional uses in herbal medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
