<p>Festuca subulifolia var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive trait where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
