                    <h1>Festuca supina</h1>
<p>Festuca supina, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, tufted leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Festuca supina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance.</p>
