<p>Fragaria vesca f. albida, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a naturally occurring variant of the wild strawberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers and smaller, less flavorful fruits compared to the typical red strawberry. This plant is a diploid species with a genome size similar to its parent species, Fragaria vesca. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The white strawberry is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and genetic research potential.</p>
