                    <h1>Festuca umbrosa</h1>
<p>Festuca umbrosa, commonly known as shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca umbrosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
