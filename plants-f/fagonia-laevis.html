                    <h1>Fagonia laevis</h1>
<p>Fagonia laevis, commonly known as the smooth fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its pale green, spineless stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Fagonia laevis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
