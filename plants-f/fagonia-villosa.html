                    <h1>Fagonia villosa</h1>
<p>Fagonia villosa, commonly known as the woolly fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage, which is densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Fagonia villosa is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
