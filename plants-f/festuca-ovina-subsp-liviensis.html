<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>liviensis, commonly known as the Alpine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
