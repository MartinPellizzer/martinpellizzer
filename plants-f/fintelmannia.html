                    <h1>Fintelmannia</h1>
<p>Fintelmannia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Fintelmannia has small, scale-like leaves and lacks true roots, making it highly specialized for its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
