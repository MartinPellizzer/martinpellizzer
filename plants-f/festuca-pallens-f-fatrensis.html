<p>Festuca pallens f. fatrensis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect excess sunlight in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
