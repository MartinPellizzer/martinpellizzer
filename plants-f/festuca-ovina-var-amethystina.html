<p>Festuca ovina var. amethystina, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking purplish-blue foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the cooler months. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
