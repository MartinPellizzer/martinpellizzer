                    <h1>Frankenia intermedia var. annua</h1>
<p>Frankenia intermedia var. annua, commonly known as the annual beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Frankenia intermedia var. annua plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
