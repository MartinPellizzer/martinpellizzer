                    <h1>Festuca quadridentata</h1>
<p>Festuca quadridentata, commonly known as the four-toothed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves have four distinct teeth along the edges, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Festuca quadridentata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
