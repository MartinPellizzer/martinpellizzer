<p>Fraxinus arbutifolia, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant wintergreen scent when scraped. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in the production of canoe bark.</p>
