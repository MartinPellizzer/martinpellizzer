                    <h1>Fragaria collina dumetorum</h1>
<p>Fragaria collina dumetorum, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, red, berry-like fruits that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and can survive in harsh climates.</p>
