                    <h1>Festuca rubra subvar. aurata</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra subvar. aurata, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form dense, decorative ground cover.</p>
