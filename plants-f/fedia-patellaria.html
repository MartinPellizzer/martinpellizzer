                    <h1>Fedia patellaria</h1>
<p>Fedia patellaria, commonly known as the Patellaria fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or forested substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fedia patellaria is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
