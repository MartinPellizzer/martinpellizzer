<p>Fryxellia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fryxellia, is a small, perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with tiny, clustered leaves and pale green to reddish stems. Fryxellia pygmaea typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on desert flora and plant adaptation strategies.</p>
