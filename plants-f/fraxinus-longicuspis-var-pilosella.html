<p>Fraxinus longicuspis var. pilosella, commonly known as the silky ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely pubescent leaves, which are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical variety. The bark of this species is smooth and gray, often developing shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
