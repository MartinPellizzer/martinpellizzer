<p>Fordia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, bark-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, typically in shades of white or yellow. These flowers are followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Fordia coriacea thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
