                    <h1>Ferocactus acanthodes var. eastwoodiae</h1>
<p>Ferocactus acanthodes var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its adaptations to desert conditions include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
