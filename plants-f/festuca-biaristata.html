<p>Festuca biaristata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has fine, tufted blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring.
