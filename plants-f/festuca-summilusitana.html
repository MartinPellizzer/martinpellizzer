                    <h1>Festuca summilusitana</h1>
<p>Festuca summilusitana, commonly known as the high alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, mountainous environments with poor soil conditions, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
