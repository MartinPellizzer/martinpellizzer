<p>Ferula laevigata, commonly known as the smooth ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ferula laevigata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
