                    <h1>Festuca rupicola f. strictiflora</h1>
<p>Festuca rupicola f. strictiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered rockgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically pale green to reddish in hue. This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
