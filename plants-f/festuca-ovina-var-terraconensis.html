                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. terraconensis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. terraconensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and stabilize soil, contributing to erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, adding ornamental value to its habitat.</p>
