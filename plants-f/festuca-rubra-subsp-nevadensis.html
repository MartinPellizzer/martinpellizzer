<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as Sierra bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Sierra bentgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
