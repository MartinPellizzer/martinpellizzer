<p>Filago leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance has made it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
