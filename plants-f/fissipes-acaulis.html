<p>Fissipes acaulis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Fissipes acaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats.</p>
