                    <h1>Ficus strangularis</h1>
<p>Ficus strangularis, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, where they can take root and form additional trunks. These roots contribute to the tree's distinctive appearance and help support its massive canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig fruits, which are an important food source for various animals.</p>
<p>Ficus strangularis is often found in moist, tropical environments and can grow to impressive sizes, sometimes spanning several acres.</p>
