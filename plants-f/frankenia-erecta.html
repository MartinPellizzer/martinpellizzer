                    <h1>Frankenia erecta</h1>
<p>Frankenia erecta, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the coastlines. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Frankenia erecta is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
