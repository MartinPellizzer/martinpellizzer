                    <h1>Ferula salsa</h1>
<p>Ferula salsa, commonly known as desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its taproot and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, powdery coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Ferula salsa is also known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been used traditionally in some Native American cultures.</p>
