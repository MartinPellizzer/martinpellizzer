<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>cryophila, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold, mountainous regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundras and rocky slopes. Its compact growth and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological significance in cold environments.</p>
