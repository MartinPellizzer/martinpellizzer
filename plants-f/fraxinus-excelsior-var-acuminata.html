<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Fraxinus excelsior. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in woodland areas and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
