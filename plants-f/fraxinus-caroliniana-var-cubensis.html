<p>Fraxinus caroliniana var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively rare and has specific ecological roles in its native habitats.</p>
