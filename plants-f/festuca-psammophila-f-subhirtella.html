                    <h1>Festuca psammophila f. subhirtella</h1>
<p>Festuca psammophila f. subhirtella, commonly known as the sand fescue subhirtella, is a grass species characterized by its adaptation to sandy and arid environments.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a low, compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet arrangement, which is typical of many fescue species. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal and desert regions.</p>
