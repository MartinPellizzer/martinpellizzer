                <h1>Festuca arundinacea</h1>
<p>Festuca arundinacea, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-based flowers. Tall fescue is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>However, some cultivars may contain toxic endophytic fungi, which can affect livestock grazing.</p>
