                    <h1>Festuca rubra var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra var. heterophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that often turns reddish in response to environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, uniform lawns.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
