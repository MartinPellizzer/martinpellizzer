                    <h1>Festuca rubra subvar. velutina</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra subvar. velutina, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky texture that gives it a soft appearance. The leaves are typically bluish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and pasturelands due to its drought tolerance and wear resistance.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense sod.</p>
