<p>Frenela fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub or sea holly, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Frenela fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
