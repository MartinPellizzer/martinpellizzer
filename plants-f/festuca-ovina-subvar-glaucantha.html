                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. glaucantha</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. glaucantha, commonly known as blue mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage, which is due to the presence of a dense layer of waxy hairs on the leaves. This subspecies typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, erect culms and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
