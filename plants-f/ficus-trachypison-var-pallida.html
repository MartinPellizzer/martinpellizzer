<p>Ficus trachypison var. pallida, commonly known as the pale fig or white-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that often have a pale or white midrib, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
