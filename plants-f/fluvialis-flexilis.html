                    <h1>Fluvialis flexilis</h1>
<p>Fluvialis flexilis, commonly known as the river willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flexible, slender stems that can bend without breaking, allowing it to thrive in flowing water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are long and narrow, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged.</p>
<p>Fluvialis flexilis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
