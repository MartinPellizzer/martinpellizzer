<p>Farsetia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf farsetia, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
