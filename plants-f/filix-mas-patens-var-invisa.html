<p>Filix-mas patens var. invisa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a variant of the common fern species Filix-mas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically longer and wider than those of the standard variety. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage.</p>
