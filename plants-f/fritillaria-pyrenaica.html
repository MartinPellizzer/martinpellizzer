                    <h1>Fritillaria pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Fritillaria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France.</p>
<p>It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive black or purple blotch at the base. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
