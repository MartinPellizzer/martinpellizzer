                    <h1>Fraxinus longicuspis f. lancea</h1>
<p>Fraxinus longicuspis f. lancea, commonly known as the lance-leaved ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits distinct foliage compared to the typical species, with leaves that are longer and more pointed. The plant is native to certain regions of North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The lance-leaved ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
