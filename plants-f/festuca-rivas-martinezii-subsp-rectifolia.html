<p>Festuca rivas-martinezii subsp.</p>
<p>rectifolia, commonly known as the straight-leaved fescue, is a rare grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically straight and elongated.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, greenish to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
