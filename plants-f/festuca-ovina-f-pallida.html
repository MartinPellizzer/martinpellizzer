                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. pallida</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. pallida, commonly known as silverblue fescue, is a cool-season grass that exhibits a distinct silver-blue hue due to its fine, densely packed leaves.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which are typically short-lived and appear in late spring to early summer. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover, helping to prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina f. pallida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
