<p>Fagelia fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, dark wood, it has been historically valued for craftsmanship, though its conservation status is a concern.</p>
