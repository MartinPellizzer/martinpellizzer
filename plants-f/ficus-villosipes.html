<p>Ficus villosipes, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus villosipes is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities.</p>
