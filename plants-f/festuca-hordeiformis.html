                    <h1>Festuca hordeiformis</h1>
<p>Festuca hordeiformis, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to brownish flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca hordeiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
