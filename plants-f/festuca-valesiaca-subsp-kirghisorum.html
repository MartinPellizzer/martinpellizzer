<p>Festuca valesiaca subsp.</p>
<p>kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-ranked spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
