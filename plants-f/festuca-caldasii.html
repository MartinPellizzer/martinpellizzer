<p>Festuca caldasii, commonly known as the Caldas mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Festuca caldasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
