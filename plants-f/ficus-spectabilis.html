The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in a spherical, fuzzy structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments.</p>
