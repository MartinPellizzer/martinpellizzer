                    <h1>Ficus racemosa</h1>
<p>Ficus racemosa, commonly known as the cluster fig or Indian rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a thick, buttressed trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. Its roots are fibrous and can develop aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Ficus racemosa thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
