                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica var. longipes</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica var. longipes, commonly known as the European beech, is a variant of the common beech that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated leaves, which are typically longer and more pointed than those of the standard variety. The tree produces small, rounded nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are deciduous, turning yellow in autumn before falling, and its bark is smooth and gray in youth.</p>
<p>This variant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
