                    <h1>Festuca tectoria</h1>
<p>Festuca tectoria, commonly known as roof grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in restoration ecology due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
