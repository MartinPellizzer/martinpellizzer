                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. briquetii</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. briquetii, commonly known as the Briquet's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these harsh habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
