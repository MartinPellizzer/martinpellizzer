                    <h1>Fraxinus nigra</h1>
<p>Fraxinus nigra, commonly known as black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters and has a slender, often twisted trunk with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Black ash is adapted to wet, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps and along streams.</p>
