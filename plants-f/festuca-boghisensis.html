                    <h1>Festuca boghisensis</h1>
<p>Festuca boghisensis, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland environments.</p>
