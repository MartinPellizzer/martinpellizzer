<p>Ficinia gracilis, commonly known as the slender false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem with a single, spirally arranged leaf that is often reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Ficinia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
