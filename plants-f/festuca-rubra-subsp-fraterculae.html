<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>fraterculae, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted inflorescences that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a common species in dunes and coastal meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats.</p>
