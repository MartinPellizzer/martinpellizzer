                    <h1>Fragaria vesca var. collina</h1>
<p>Fragaria vesca var. collina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate white flowers that develop into edible berries, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. Native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
