<p>Festuca frederikseniae, commonly known as Frederiksen's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
