<p>Fouquieria splendens subsp.</p>
<p>splendens, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, which are shed during periods of drought.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems.</p>
<p>The ocotillo plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators such as birds and bats.</p>
