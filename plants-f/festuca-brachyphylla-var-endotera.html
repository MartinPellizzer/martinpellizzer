                    <h1>Festuca brachyphylla var. endotera</h1>
<p>Festuca brachyphylla var. endotera, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense, and tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in shrub-steppe and grassland ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
