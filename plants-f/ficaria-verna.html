                <h1>Ficaria verna</h1>
<p>Ficaria verna, commonly known as the winter creeper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a white or silver underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked.</p>
