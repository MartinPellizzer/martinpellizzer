                    <h1>Fragaria palustris</h1>
<p>Fragaria palustris, commonly known as the swamp strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to true strawberries, though they are generally less sweet. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in waterlogged environments.</p>
<p>Fragaria palustris plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
