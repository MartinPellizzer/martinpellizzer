                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus var. paniculata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus var. paniculata, commonly known as the common spindle or weeping spindle, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates.</p>
