                    <h1>Fistularia goniotricha</h1>
<p>Fistularia goniotricha, commonly known as the longfin spiny eel, is a marine fish belonging to the family Synbranchidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, eel-like body and distinctive spines along its dorsal and pectoral fins. This species is typically found in coastal waters and estuaries across the Indo-Pacific region. Its botanical aspects are less prominent, as it is not a plant, but rather a fish, and thus does not have typical plant structures such as roots, stems, or leaves.</p>
<p>However, it plays an important ecological role in marine and brackish water ecosystems.</p>
