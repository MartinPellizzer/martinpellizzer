                    <h1>Festuca rubra subvar. alvarensis</h1>
<p>Festuca rubra subvar. alvarensis, commonly known as alpine red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
