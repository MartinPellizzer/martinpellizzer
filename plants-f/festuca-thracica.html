<p>Festuca thracica, commonly known as Thrace bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
