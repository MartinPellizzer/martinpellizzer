The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are encased in a smooth, green husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus laurentina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
