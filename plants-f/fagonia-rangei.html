                    <h1>Fagonia rangei</h1>
<p>Fagonia rangei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are usually spiny, which helps to reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Fagonia rangei is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
