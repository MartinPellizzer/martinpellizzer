<p>Fagus sylvatica var. macrophylla, commonly known as the European beech with large leaves, is a variant of the European beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are larger than those of the typical Fagus sylvatica. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which contribute to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
