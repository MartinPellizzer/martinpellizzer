                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or blue fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced in the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that provide erosion control and habitat for small wildlife.</p>
