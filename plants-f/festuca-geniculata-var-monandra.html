                    <h1>Festuca geniculata var. monandra</h1>
<p>Festuca geniculata var. monandra, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
