<p>Festuca triflora, commonly known as mountain grass or three-flowered bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves.

Festuca triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
