                    <h1>Fraxinus potamophila</h1>
<p>Fraxinus potamophila, commonly known as the river ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in riparian zones.</p>
