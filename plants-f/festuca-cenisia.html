                <h1>Festuca cenisia</h1>
<p>Festuca cenisia, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding delicate floral detail to its structure. Festuca cenisia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth that stabilizes soil in rocky or marginal environments.</p>
