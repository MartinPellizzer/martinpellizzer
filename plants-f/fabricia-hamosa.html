<p>Fabricia hamosa, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Fabricia hamosa is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
