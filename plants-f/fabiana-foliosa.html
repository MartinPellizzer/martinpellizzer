                    <h1>Fabiana foliosa</h1>
<p>Fabiana foliosa, commonly known as the silver leaf or desert star, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Fabiana foliosa is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
