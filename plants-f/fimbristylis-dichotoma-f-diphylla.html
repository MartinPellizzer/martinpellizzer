<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swamps. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
