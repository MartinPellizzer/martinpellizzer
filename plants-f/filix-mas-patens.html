<p>Filix-mas patens, commonly known as the spreading horse-tail, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a distinctive, segmented stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Filix-mas patens reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common among primitive plants.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
