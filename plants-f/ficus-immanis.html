<p>Ficus immanis, commonly known as the giant ficus or large-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus immanis is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
