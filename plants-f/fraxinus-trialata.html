The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Fraxinus trialata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
