                    <h1>Festuca rupicola var. sulcatiformis</h1>
<p>Festuca rupicola var. sulcatiformis, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, helping it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in crevices and on slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
