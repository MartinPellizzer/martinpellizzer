                    <h1>Funifera</h1>
<p>Funifera, commonly known as the sea whip, is a genus of soft corals belonging to the family Stylasteridae.</p>
<p>These marine organisms are characterized by their delicate, branching structures that resemble whips, hence their common name. Funifera species are typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, where they attach to hard surfaces like rocks or coral reefs. Their polyps are usually small and may be covered in symbiotic algae, which contribute to their coloration.</p>
<p>Funifera plays an important ecological role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
