                    <h1>Ficus maroniensis</h1>
<p>Ficus maroniensis, commonly known as the Maroni fig, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are encased in a tough, green outer husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus maroniensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments.</p>
