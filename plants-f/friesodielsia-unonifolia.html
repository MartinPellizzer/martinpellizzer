<p>Friesodielsia unonifolia, commonly known as the single-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, single leaf that is often deeply divided into narrow, feathery segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a trait that makes it visually striking.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
