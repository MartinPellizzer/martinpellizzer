                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. monophylla</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. monophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ash, is a rare variant of the common ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its entire, smooth-edged leaves, which distinguish it from the typical serrated leaves of the species. This form is a natural variation that occurs in certain regions of Europe. The plant retains the general morphology of Fraxinus excelsior, including its slender, branching habit and winged samaras.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream valleys.</p>
