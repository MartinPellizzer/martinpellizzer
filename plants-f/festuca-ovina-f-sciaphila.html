                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. sciaphila</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving bluegrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense growth habit, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. This form of Festuca ovina is typically shorter and more compact than the standard variety, with a mat-like appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its shade tolerance, it is a popular choice for underplanting in woodland gardens or as a ground cover in shaded landscapes.</p>
