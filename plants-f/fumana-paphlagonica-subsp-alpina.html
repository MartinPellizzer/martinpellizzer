<p>Fumana paphlagonica subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the Alpina subspecies of the Paphlagonica fumana, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
