                    <h1>Fragariastrum sterile</h1>
<p>Fragariastrum sterile, commonly known as the sterile strawberry, is a botanical curiosity with no known reproductive capabilities.</p>
<p>It closely resembles the common strawberry (Fragaria vesca) but lacks the ability to produce viable seeds. The plant exhibits typical strawberry morphology, including the characteristic red, fleshy fruits, but these are non-functional and do not germinate. Its sterile nature suggests a possible mutation or hybridization event.</p>
<p>Despite its inability to reproduce, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
