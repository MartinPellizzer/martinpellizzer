<p>Fedia triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting its growth.</p>
<p>Fedia triquetra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
