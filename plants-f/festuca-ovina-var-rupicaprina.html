<p>Festuca ovina var. rupicaprina, commonly known as mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used in some ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
