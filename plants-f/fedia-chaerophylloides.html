<p>Fedia chaerophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually borne on slender stems that rise from the water surface.</p>
<p>Fedia chaerophylloides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
