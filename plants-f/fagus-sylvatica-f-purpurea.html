<p>Fagus sylvatica f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple beech, is a striking variant of the European beech.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which display a rich hue of violet during the growing season. The foliage turns a vibrant red in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>While it shares the general structure of the common beech, its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for horticultural display.</p>
