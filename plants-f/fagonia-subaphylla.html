                    <h1>Fagonia subaphylla</h1>
<p>Fagonia subaphylla, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Fagonia subaphylla is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
