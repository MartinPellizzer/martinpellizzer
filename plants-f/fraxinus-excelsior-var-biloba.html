                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. biloba</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. biloba, commonly known as the Weeping Wych Elm, is a variant of the Wych Elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also vulnerable to diseases like Dutch elm disease.</p>
