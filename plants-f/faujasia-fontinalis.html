<p>Faujasia fontinalis, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. The plant has delicate, branching stems with small, rounded leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in late spring.</p>
<p>Faujasia fontinalis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
