                    <h1>Fouquieria splendens var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Fouquieria splendens var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ocotillo, is a striking desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that remain green throughout the year, with leaves that are shed during drought periods. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in spring or early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths and bats, reflecting its ecological role in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in desert botany.</p>
