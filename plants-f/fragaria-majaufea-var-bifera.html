                    <h1>Fragaria majaufea var. bifera</h1>
<p>Fragaria majaufea var. bifera, commonly known as the double-fruited strawberry, is a variant of the strawberry plant characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It produces two flowers per stem, which can lead to the development of two fruits on a single plant. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained, fertile soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, edible fruits with a distinct flavor.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual morphology and potential for hybrid breeding.</p>
