<p>Festuca virgata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable groundcover in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Festuca virgata is also noted for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, including drought and partial shade.</p>
