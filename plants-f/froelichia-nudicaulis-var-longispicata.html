                    <h1>Froelichia nudicaulis var. longispicata</h1>
<p>Froelichia nudicaulis var. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined frostweed, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, well-drained soils within forest understories. Its most distinctive feature is the elongated, spiny bracts that surround its inflorescence, which serve as a protective mechanism for its small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly noted for its unique morphology and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
