                    <h1>Festuca unilateralis var. aristata</h1>
<p>Festuca unilateralis var. aristata, commonly known as the aristate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
