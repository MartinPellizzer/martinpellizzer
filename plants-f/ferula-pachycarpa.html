                    <h1>Ferula pachycarpa</h1>
<p>Ferula pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-barked ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, often woody stem and its ability to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ferula pachycarpa is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
