                    <h1>Fagonia lahovarii var. spinescens</h1>
<p>Fagonia lahovarii var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its harsh native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for local wildlife.</p>
