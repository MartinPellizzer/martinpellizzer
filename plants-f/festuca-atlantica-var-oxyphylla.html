                    <h1>Festuca atlantica var. oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Festuca atlantica var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the Atlantic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in harsh coastal habitats.</p>
