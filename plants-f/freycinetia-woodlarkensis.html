                    <h1>Freycinetia woodlarkensis</h1>
<p>Freycinetia woodlarkensis, commonly known as the Woodlark cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the island of Woodlark in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, slow-growing cycad with a short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
