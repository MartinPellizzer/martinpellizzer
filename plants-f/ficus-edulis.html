                    <h1>Ficus edulis</h1>
<p>Ficus edulis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that resembles a bread-like substance when ripe. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green and unripe, as it becomes too hard and bitter once fully mature. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in both ecological systems and human cultures, particularly in Pacific Island nations.</p>
