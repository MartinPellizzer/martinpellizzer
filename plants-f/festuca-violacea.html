                <h1>Festuca violacea</h1>
<p>Festuca violacea, commonly known as purple false oatgrass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that often turn a striking purple or violet hue in response to environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Festuca violacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
