                    <h1>Filago prostrata</h1>
<p>Filago prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
