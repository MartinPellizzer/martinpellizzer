                    <h1>Fenerivia angustielliptica</h1>
<p>Fenerivia angustielliptica, commonly known as the narrow-elliptical fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Its rhizomes are slender and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
