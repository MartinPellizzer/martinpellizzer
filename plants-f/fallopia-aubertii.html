                    <h1>Fallopia aubertii</h1>
<p>Fallopia aubertii, commonly known as the giant cowhead, is a vigorous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental appeal makes it popular in horticulture, though its aggressive nature requires careful management.</p>
