                    <h1>Fusanus cignorum</h1>
<p>Fusanus cignorum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors, typically pink or white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Its flowers are known to open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior that has been culturally significant in many Asian societies.</p>
<p>The sacred lotus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often symbolically associated with purity and enlightenment.</p>
