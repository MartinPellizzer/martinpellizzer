<p>Fagus sylvatica subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental Beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the common beech but is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and different geographic distribution.</p>
