<p>Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. campestris, commonly known as the sand hill black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in prairies, sand dunes, and along roadsides. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and serrated. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy component of native plant communities.</p>
