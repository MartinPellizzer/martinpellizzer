                    <h1>Filago spathulata f. desertorum</h1>
<p>Filago spathulata f. desertorum, commonly known as the desert filago, is a variant of the filago plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring or early summer. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in desert scrublands and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
