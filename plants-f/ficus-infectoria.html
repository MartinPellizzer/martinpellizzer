                    <h1>Ficus infectoria</h1>
<p>Ficus infectoria, commonly known as the poison fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces fig-like fruits that are encased in a rough, greenish-brown husk. These fruits contain a toxic latex that can cause severe skin irritation and poisoning if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for its fruit.</p>
