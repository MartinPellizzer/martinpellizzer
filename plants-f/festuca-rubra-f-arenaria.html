<p>Festuca rubra f. arenaria, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It has fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
