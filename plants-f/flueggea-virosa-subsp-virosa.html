<p>Flueggea virosa subsp.</p>
<p>virosa, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
