                    <h1>Festuca pumila</h1>
<p>Festuca pumila, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Festuca pumila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
