                    <h1>Fagus castanea var. variegata</h1>
<p>Fagus castanea var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated beech, is a variant of the common beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and sometimes golden hues. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The tree typically grows in temperate regions and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
