<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>asperispina, commonly known as the rough-spined frailea, is a compact cactus species native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines that are often rough and bristly in texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
