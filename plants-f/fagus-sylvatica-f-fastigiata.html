                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved or columnar European beech, is a unique form of the European beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, making it an ideal choice for formal gardens and landscapes. The leaves are smaller and more elongated compared to the typical beech, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
