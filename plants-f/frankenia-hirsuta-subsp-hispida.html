<p>Frankenia hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>hispida, commonly known as the rough frankenia, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often sticky foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
