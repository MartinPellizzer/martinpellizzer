                    <h1>Ficus caryophylla</h1>
<p>Ficus caryophylla, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. Ficus caryophylla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its aerial roots and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor vertical gardening.</p>
