                    <h1>Fraxinus americana var. nigra</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana var. nigra, commonly known as black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to the emerald ash borer, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
