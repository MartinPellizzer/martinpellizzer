                    <h1>Filago minima var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Filago minima var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf filago, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
