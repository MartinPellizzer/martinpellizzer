<p>Fimbristylis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region.</p>
