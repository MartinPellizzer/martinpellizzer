<p>Fumaria corymbosa, commonly known as the yellow weed or crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, bead-like seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study.</p>
