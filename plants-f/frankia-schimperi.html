                    <h1>Frankia schimperi</h1>
<p>Frankia schimperi, commonly known as the African alder, is a nitrogen-fixing actinomycete that forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants.</p>
<p>It is particularly associated with members of the legume family, such as Acacia and Prosopis species. The bacterium colonizes the root nodules of its host plants, converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by the plant. This makes Frankia schimperi important in nutrient-poor soils, enhancing plant growth and soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments contributes to its ecological significance in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
