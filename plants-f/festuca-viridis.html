<p>Festuca viridis, commonly known as green fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. The plant typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Festuca viridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a lush, uniform turf.</p>
