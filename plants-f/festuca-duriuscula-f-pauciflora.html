                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula f. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fescue, is a hemicryptophytic perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single or few spikelets, which are small and compact, characteristic of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited floral display, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
