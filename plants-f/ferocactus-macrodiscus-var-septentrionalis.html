The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
