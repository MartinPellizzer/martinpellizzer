<p>Ficus perez-arbelaezii, commonly known as the Périz-Arbeláez fig, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ficus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and unique, elongated fruiting structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
