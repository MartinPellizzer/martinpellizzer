                    <h1>Frankenia pilosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia pilosa, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Frankenia pilosa is well adapted to salty air and periodic inundation, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
