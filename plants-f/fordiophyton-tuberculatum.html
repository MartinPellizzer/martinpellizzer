                    <h1>Fordiophyton tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Fordiophyton tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spur, which is a specialized structure adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
