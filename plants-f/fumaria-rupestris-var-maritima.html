                    <h1>Fumaria rupestris var. maritima</h1>
<p>Fumaria rupestris var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal yellowweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal flora.</p>
