<p>Festuca patzkei, commonly known as Patzke's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca patzkei is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded areas.</p>
