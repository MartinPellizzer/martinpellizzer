<p>Ficus casearioides, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along structures.</p>
<p>Ficus casearioides is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings.</p>
