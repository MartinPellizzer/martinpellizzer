                    <h1>Frankenia fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are small, opposite, and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Frankenia fruticulosa is adapted to coastal environments and is often used in dune stabilization due to its hardy nature.</p>
