                    <h1>Fissistigma manubriatum</h1>
<p>Fissistigma manubriatum, commonly known as the giant bamboo or giant rattan, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Palmae (palm family) and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as roofing material. Its rapid growth and structural strength make it valuable for both commercial and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
