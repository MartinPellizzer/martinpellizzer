                    <h1>Fraxinus insularis var. henryana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus insularis var. henryana, commonly known as the Henry's Ash, is a rare variant of the insular ash native to China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
