                    <h1>Ficus verrucosa</h1>
<p>Ficus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its aerial roots and ability to climb make it a common epiphyte in its natural habitat.</p>
