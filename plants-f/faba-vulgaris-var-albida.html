<p>Faba vulgaris var. albida, commonly known as the white bean or white fava, is a variety of the broad bean plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white pods and seeds, which are smaller and less robust compared to typical fava beans. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. It has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>The leaves are trifoliate, with a rough texture, and the plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm.</p>
