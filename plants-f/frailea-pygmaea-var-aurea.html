                    <h1>Frailea pygmaea var. aurea</h1>
<p>Frailea pygmaea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden frailea, is a compact, leafy cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation.</p>
