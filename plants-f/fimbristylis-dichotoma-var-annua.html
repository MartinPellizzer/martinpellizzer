                    <h1>Fimbristylis dichotoma var. annua</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis dichotoma var. annua, commonly known as the annual flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
