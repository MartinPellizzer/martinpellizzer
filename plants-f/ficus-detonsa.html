                    <h1>Ficus detonsa</h1>
<p>Ficus detonsa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or red in color.</p>
<p>Ficus detonsa is often used in traditional medicine and is well adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
