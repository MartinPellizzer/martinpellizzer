<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>bushiana, commonly known as Bushy red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its fine texture and ability to tolerate drought make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
