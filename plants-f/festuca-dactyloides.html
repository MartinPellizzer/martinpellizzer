                    <h1>Festuca dactyloides</h1>
<p>Festuca dactyloides, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native perennial grass species found throughout the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted foliage and its ability to thrive in dry, arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Buffalograss is well adapted to drought and requires minimal water and maintenance, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
