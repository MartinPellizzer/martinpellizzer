                    <h1>Forchhammeria trifoliata</h1>
<p>Forchhammeria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stems. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Forchhammeria trifoliata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it a common sight in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
