<p>Ficus parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>gibbosa, commonly known as the giant fig vine, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant attaches itself to host trees using aerial roots, deriving water and nutrients from its host while still performing photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are an important food source for various animals.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
