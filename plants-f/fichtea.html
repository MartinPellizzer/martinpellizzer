                    <h1>Fichtea</h1>
<p>Fichtea, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, purple-coned seed cones that mature to release winged seeds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Fichtea is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
