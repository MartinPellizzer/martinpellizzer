<p>Frangula oreodendron, commonly known as the desert sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and small, elliptical leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. Frangula oreodendron has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
