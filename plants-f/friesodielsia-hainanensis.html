                    <h1>Friesodielsia hainanensis</h1>
<p>Friesodielsia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
