                    <h1>Festuca pumila var. hackeliana</h1>
<p>Festuca pumila var. hackeliana, commonly known as the Hackel's fine fescue, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy perennial. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
