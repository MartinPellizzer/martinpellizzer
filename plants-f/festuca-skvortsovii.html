                    <h1>Festuca skvortsovii</h1>
<p>Festuca skvortsovii, commonly known as Skvortsov's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions.</p>
