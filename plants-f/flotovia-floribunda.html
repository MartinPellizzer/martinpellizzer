                    <h1>Flotovia floribunda</h1>
<p>Flotovia floribunda, commonly known as the floating flower vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique ability to grow on the surface of water.</p>
<p>Its stems are flexible and can spread across water bodies, anchoring themselves with small root-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in marshy areas or slow-moving waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
