<p>Fissistigma rubiginosum, commonly known as the rusty leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
