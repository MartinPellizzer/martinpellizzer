<p>Festuca pallens subsp.</p>
<p>colorata, commonly known as the purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage with a distinctive purple tinge on the leaves, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature.</p>
