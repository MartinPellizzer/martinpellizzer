                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in alpine meadows, dry slopes, and disturbed soils due to its drought tolerance and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects and native landscaping.</p>
