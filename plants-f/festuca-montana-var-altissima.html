                    <h1>Festuca montana var. altissima</h1>
<p>Festuca montana var. altissima, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca montana var. altissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
