                    <h1>Fraxinus angustifolia var. rostrata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus angustifolia var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash or rostrated ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically green in summer and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for smaller landscapes due to its compact growth and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
