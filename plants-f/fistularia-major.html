                    <h1>Fistularia major</h1>
<p>Fistularia major, commonly known as the longfinned flounder, is a marine fish belonging to the family Paralichthyidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive, asymmetrical tail fin. This species is typically found in coastal waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, often inhabiting sandy or muddy substrates. The fish has a laterally compressed body that allows it to lie flat on the seafloor, aiding in camouflage and ambush predation.</p>
<p>Its botanical aspects are less prominent, as it is primarily a marine organism rather than a plant.</p>
