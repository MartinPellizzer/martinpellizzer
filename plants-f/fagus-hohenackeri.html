                    <h1>Fagus hohenackeri</h1>
<p>Fagus hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker beech, is a rare and ancient species of beech native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagus hohenackeri is considered a conservation priority.</p>
