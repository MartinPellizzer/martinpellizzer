                    <h1>Festuca littoralis</h1>
<p>Festuca littoralis, commonly known as seaside bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and wind exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca littoralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
