<p>Fraxinus oxyphylla var. oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
