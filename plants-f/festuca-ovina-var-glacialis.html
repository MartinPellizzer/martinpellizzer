                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. glacialis, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and poor soil, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina var. glacialis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
