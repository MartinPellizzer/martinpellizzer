<p>Frankenia laevis subsp.</p>
<p>phosphatica, commonly known as the phosphatic frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its landscape. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of coastal flora in its native habitat.</p>
