<p>Festuca violacea var. flaccida, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with purple, especially at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue or purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
