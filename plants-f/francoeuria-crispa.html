<p>Francoeuria crispa, commonly known as the brittlestemmed sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Francoeuria crispa is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
