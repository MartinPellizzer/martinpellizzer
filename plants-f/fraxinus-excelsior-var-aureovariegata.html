                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior var. aureovariegata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior var. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden-leaved ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its striking yellow-variegated foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive golden-green pattern that enhances its visual appeal in gardens and landscapes. It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters, with a broad, spreading crown that provides shade. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental planting, though it is susceptible to ash dieback disease.</p>
