                    <h1>Festuca morisiana</h1>
<p>Festuca morisiana, commonly known as Morisian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Festuca morisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
