                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. bigorronensis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. bigorronensis, commonly known as the Bigorre bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees region of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered with a whitish bloom. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountain meadows and grassy slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense, sod-like mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
