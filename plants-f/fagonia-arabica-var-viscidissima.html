                    <h1>Fagonia arabica var. viscidissima</h1>
<p>Fagonia arabica var. viscidissima, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
