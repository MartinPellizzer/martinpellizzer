                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. aurea</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. aurea, commonly known as the golden ash, is a variant of the European ash tree characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree exhibits finely serrated leaves that turn a vivid golden color in the autumn, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It retains the typical growth habit of the parent species, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>While it shares the ecological roles of other ash species, its unique coloration makes it a distinctive addition to gardens and parks.</p>
