<p>Facheiroa squamosa subsp.</p>
<p>polygona, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion.</p>
