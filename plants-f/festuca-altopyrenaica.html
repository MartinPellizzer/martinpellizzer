                    <h1>Festuca altopyrenaica</h1>
<p>Festuca altopyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca altopyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
