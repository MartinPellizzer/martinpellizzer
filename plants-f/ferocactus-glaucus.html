                    <h1>Ferocactus glaucus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus glaucus, commonly known as the blue hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a blue-gray or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its spines are typically yellow or brown, providing both protection and a distinctive visual feature.</p>
<p>Ferocactus glaucus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
