                    <h1>Flourensia riparia</h1>
<p>Flourensia riparia, commonly known as desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with soft, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres similar to dandelion seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Flourensia riparia is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
