                    <h1>Fraxinus spaethiana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus spaethiana, commonly known as the Spaeth's ash, is a rare and critically endangered species native to a small region in southern Germany.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender trunk, smooth bark, and distinctive, elongated leaves with a doubly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
