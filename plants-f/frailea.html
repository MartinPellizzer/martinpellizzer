                    <h1>Frailea</h1>
<p>Frailea, commonly known as the "living stone" or "lithops," is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Frailea species typically have a compact, rosette-like growth form, with leaves that are often colored in shades of green, blue, or red. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, usually during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, Frailea plants are popular among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
