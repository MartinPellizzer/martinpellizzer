<p>Furcraea spinosa, commonly known as the spinous furcraea, is a succulent plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Furcraea spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
