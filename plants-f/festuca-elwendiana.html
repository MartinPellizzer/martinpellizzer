<p>Festuca elwendiana, commonly known as the Elwendian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca elwendiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
