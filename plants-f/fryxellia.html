                    <h1>Fryxellia</h1>
<p>Fryxellia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Fryxellia species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and the ability to store water in their thick, fleshy stems. They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal, Fryxellia species are also cultivated in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
