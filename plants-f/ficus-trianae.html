<p>Ficus trianae, commonly known as the Triana fig or the curly willow fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often curl at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. Ficus trianae thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
