                    <h1>Frankenia microphylla var. juniperina</h1>
<p>Frankenia microphylla var. juniperina, commonly known as coastal frankenia, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
