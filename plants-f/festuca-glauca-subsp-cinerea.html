<p>Festuca glauca subsp.</p>
<p>cinerea, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, flowering stems that bear small, blue to purple spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
