                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica var. atropunicea</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica var. atropunicea, commonly known as the purple-leafed beech, is a rare and striking variant of the common beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, dark reddish-purple foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical green of the standard species. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, leading to the unique leaf coloration. The tree retains its autumnal hues throughout much of the growing season, making it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is typically found in specific regions of Europe, where its unusual appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
