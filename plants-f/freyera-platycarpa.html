                    <h1>Freyera platycarpa</h1>
<p>Freyera platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited freyera, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a distinctive, thick-walled capsule that contains several small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Freyera platycarpa is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
