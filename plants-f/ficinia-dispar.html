                    <h1>Ficinia dispar</h1>
<p>Ficinia dispar, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedum, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, Ficinia dispar is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
