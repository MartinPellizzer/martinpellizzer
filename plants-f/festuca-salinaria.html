                    <h1>Festuca salinaria</h1>
<p>Festuca salinaria, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca salinaria thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions makes it an important component of coastal and saline ecosystems.</p>
