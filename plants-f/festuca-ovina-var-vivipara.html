                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that bear both sterile and fertile florets, with the fertile ones developing into small, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through its viviparous structures, which allow for rapid colonization of suitable habitats.</p>
