                            <h1>Festuca Richardsonii Subsp. Fraterculae</h1>
<p>Bluegrass, scientifically known as Festuca richardsonii subsp. fraterculae, is a hardy perennial grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its dense, fine-textured foliage and its ability to form thick, resilient turf. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and well-suited for erosion control. With its striking blue-green color and ecological benefits, Bluegrass is both an ornamental and functional addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
