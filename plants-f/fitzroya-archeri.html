                    <h1>Fitzroya archeri</h1>
<p>Fitzroya archeri, commonly known as the Chilean wine tree, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Andes Mountains of southern Chile and western Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage, which forms a rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Fitzroya archeri is also valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
