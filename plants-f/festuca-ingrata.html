<p>Festuca ingrata, commonly known as the bitter fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca ingrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
