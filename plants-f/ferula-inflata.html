<p>Ferula inflata, commonly known as the inflated ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive, inflated fruit that resembles a small bladder, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ferula inflata is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
