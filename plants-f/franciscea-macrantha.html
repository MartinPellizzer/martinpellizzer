                    <h1>Franciscea macrantha</h1>
<p>Franciscea macrantha, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a unique plant species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a fibrous root system that attaches to its host.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of leaves and chlorophyll, it plays a role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth of its host plants.</p>
