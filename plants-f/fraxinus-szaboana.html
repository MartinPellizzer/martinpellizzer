<p>Fraxinus szaboana, commonly known as the Szabó's ash, is a rare and endemic species native to Hungary.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
