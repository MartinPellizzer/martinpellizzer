<p>Festuca rubra var. stapfiana, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
