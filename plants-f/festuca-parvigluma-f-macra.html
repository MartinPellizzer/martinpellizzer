<p>Festuca parvigluma f. macra, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its upright growth habit and fine, tufted leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with dense, compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic.</p>
