<p>Feuilleea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal leaf plant, is a unique species native to sandy shorelines.</p>
<p>It possesses broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand strong sea breezes. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Feuilleea littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
