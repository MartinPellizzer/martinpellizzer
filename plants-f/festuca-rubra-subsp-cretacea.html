<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>cretacea, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky or dry soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments due to its tolerance of harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive turf-like cover.</p>
