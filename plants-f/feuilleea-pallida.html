<p>Feuilleea pallida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and sought-after species. Its leaves are typically light green to almost white, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Feuilleea pallida is often found growing in clusters on rocky outcrops or along the bases of ancient trees.</p>
