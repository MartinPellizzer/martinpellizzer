<p>Fraxinus sambucina var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a variant of the European ash tree characterized by its soft, velvety texture on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a distinctive glossy appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting, though it is less common in the wild.</p>
