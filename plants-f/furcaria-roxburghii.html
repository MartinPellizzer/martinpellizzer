<p>Furcaria roxburghii, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of fleshy, cylindrical stems that form a rounded, ball-like structure. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are borne in tight, spherical clusters. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
