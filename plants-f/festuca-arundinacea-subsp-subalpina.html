<p>Festuca arundinacea subsp.</p>
<p>subalpina, commonly known as alpine Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a prominent midrib, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats.</p>
