<p>Festuca greuteri, commonly known as Greuter's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca greuteri is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for landscaping in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
