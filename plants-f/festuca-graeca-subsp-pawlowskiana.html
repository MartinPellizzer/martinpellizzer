<p>Festuca graeca subsp.</p>
<p>pawlowskiana, commonly known as the Greek bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage that remains dense and compact throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and ability to form dense mats, contributing to erosion control in rocky or arid environments.</p>
