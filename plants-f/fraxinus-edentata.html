<p>Fraxinus edentata, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 meters with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind.</p>
