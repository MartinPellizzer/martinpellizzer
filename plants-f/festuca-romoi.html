<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca romoi is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
