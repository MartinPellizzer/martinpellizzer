                    <h1>Fumaria boissieri</h1>
<p>Fumaria boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, faintly aromatic smoke-like scent, which is released when its stems are crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
