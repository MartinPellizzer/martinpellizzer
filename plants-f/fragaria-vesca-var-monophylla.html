                    <h1>Fragaria vesca var. monophylla</h1>
<p>Fragaria vesca var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf strawberry, is a rare variant of the woodland strawberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single leaf at the base of each stem, unlike the typical trifoliate leaves of most Fragaria species. This plant produces small, edible fruits similar to those of the common strawberry, though they are often less abundant. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
