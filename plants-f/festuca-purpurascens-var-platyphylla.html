<p>Festuca purpurascens var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
