                    <h1>Fraxinus americana var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus americana var. longifolia, commonly known as the American waterfraxin, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have three to five lobes, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clustered inflorescences, and it produces samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often found near water sources, hence its common name, and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits.</p>
