                    <h1>Fumaria capreolata var. muralis</h1>
<p>Fumaria capreolata var. muralis, commonly known as the wall fumitory, is a variant of the fumitory plant characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich environments, often growing on walls or in crevices where it can access moisture and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively rare and is often found in specific regions with suitable alkaline soils.</p>
