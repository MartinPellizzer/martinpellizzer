The plant produces small, round fig fruits that are usually green when mature, though they may change color slightly. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists.</p>
