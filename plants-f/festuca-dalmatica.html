<p>Festuca dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca dalmatica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
