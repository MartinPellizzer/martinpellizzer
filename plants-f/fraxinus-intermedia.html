                    <h1>Fraxinus intermedia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across suitable habitats.</p>
