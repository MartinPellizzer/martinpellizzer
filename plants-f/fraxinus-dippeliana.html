                    <h1>Fraxinus dippeliana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus dippeliana, commonly known as the Dippel's ash, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fraxinus dippeliana is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
