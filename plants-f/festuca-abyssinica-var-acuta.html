<p>Festuca abyssinica var. acuta, commonly known as the Abyssinian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
