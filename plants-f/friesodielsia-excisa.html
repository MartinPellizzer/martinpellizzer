<p>Friesodielsia excisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along its branches. The plant produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often found in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. Friesodielsia excisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
