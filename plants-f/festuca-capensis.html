                    <h1>Festuca capensis</h1>
<p>Festuca capensis, commonly known as the Cape bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to thrive in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Festuca capensis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
