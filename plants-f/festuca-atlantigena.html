<p>Festuca atlantigena, commonly known as the Atlantic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Festuca atlantigena is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
