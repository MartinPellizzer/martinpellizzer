                    <h1>Festuca nana</h1>
<p>Festuca nana, commonly known as dwarf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters, with dense, tufted foliage that forms a compact mound. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green color, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca nana is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
