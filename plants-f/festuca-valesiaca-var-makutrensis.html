                    <h1>Festuca valesiaca var. makutrensis</h1>
<p>Festuca valesiaca var. makutrensis, commonly known as the Makutren Meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
