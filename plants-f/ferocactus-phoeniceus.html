<p>Ferocactus phoeniceus, commonly known as the crimson barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Ferocactus phoeniceus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
