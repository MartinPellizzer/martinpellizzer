<p>Fraxinus americana var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical fraxinus. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, river bottoms, and other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>
