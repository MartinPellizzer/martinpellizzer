<p>Flickingeria dahlemensis, commonly known as the Dahlem fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
