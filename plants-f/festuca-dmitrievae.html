                    <h1>Festuca dmitrievae</h1>
<p>Festuca dmitrievae, commonly known as Dmitriev's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Festuca dmitrievae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
