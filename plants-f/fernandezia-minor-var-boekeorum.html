                    <h1>Fernandezia minor var. boekeorum</h1>
<p>Fernandezia minor var. boekeorum, commonly known as the Boeke's dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can absorb sufficient humidity. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
