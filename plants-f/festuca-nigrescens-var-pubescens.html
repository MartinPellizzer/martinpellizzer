<p>Festuca nigrescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
