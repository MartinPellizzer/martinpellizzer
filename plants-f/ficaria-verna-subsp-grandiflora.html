<p>Ficaria verna subsp.</p>
<p>grandiflora, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of glossy, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and early blooming habit.</p>
