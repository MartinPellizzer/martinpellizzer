                    <h1>Filicula</h1>
<p>Filicula, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a type of primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low vegetation. Filicula species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle involves both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>These plants are considered ancient and have been around since the Paleozoic era.</p>
