                    <h1>Fumaria barnolae</h1>
<p>Fumaria barnolae, commonly known as the Barnola fumewort, is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its delicate, often hairy foliage and showy, yellowish-orange flowers.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators with their nectar-rich petals. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Fumaria barnolae is relatively rare and is often found in specific, localized habitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
