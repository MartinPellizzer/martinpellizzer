                    <h1>Fallopia × moravica</h1>
<p>Fallopia × moravica, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Fallopia japonica and Fallopia sachalina, which gives it a unique combination of characteristics from both parent plants. The plant is notable for its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, and its tall, stout stems that often have a reddish hue. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions.</p>
