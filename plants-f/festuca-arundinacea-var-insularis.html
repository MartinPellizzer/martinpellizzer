<p>Festuca arundinacea var. insularis, commonly known as the island meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
