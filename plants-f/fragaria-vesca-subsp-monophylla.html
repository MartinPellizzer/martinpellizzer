<p>Fragaria vesca subsp.</p>
<p>monophylla, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a subspecies of the woodland strawberry. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are less commonly cultivated than other strawberries. It thrives in cool, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies of plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions.</p>
