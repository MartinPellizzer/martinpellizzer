                    <h1>Funkia alba</h1>
<p>Funkia alba, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white, lily-like flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense underwater mats.</p>
<p>Funkia alba is often used in water feature landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae by competing for nutrients.</p>
