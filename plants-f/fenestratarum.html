<p>Fenestratarum, commonly known as the fenestrated fern, is a striking plant characterized by its unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>Its fronds are divided into segments with distinctive fenestrations, or holes, that give it a lace-like appearance. This plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fenestrations help reduce wind resistance and allow for more efficient light absorption.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
