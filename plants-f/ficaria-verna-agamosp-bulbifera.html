<p>Ficaria verna agamosp.</p>
<p>bulbifera, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that turn reddish in color as the plant matures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its reproductive strategy includes both sexual reproduction through seeds and asexual propagation via bulbils, which form at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is often found in woodland and meadow habitats, thriving in well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
