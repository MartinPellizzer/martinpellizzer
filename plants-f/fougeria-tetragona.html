                    <h1>Fougeria tetragona</h1>
<p>Fougeria tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Fougeria tetragona thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
