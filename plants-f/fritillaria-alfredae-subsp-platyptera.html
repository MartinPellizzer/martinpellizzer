<p>Fritillaria alfredae subsp.</p>
<p>platyptera, commonly known as the flat-leaf fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open woodlands or meadows. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, alpine conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
