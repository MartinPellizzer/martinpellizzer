                    <h1>Festuca glauca f. borhidiana</h1>
<p>Festuca glauca f. borhidiana, commonly known as the Borhidian bluegrass, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities in garden design.</p>
