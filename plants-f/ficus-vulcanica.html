                    <h1>Ficus vulcanica</h1>
<p>Ficus vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic fig, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, green figs that are typically not edible for humans but are important for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow in harsh, volcanic soils makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
