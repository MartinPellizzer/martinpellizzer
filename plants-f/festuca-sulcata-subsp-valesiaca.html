<p>Festuca sulcata subsp.</p>
<p>valesiaca, commonly known as Valesiaca fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.</p>
