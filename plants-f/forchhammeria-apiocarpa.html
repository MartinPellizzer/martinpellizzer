                    <h1>Forchhammeria apiocarpa</h1>
<p>Forchhammeria apiocarpa, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
