<p>Fordiophyton cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often at high altitudes, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
