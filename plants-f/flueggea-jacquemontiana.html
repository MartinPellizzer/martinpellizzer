                    <h1>Flueggea jacquemontiana</h1>
<p>Flueggea jacquemontiana, commonly known as the red-flowered flueggea, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
