                    <h1>Flotovia glabra</h1>
<p>Flotovia glabra, commonly known as the smooth flotovia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Flotovia glabra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
