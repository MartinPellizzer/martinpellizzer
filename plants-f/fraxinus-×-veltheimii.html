<p>Fraxinus × veltheimii, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus ornus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, white, spiny flowers that appear in late spring, followed by large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in parks and gardens across Europe.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for urban landscaping.</p>
