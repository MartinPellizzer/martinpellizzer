                            <h1>Faberia Silhetensis Subsp. Bhutanica</h1>
<p>Faberia silhetensis subsp. bhutanica is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant found in the mountainous regions of Bhutan. This subspecies belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its leguminous plants that often form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It is characterized by its delicate leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique plant from the threats of habitat loss and climate change.</p>
