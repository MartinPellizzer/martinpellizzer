<p>Festuca ovina var. lapidosa, commonly known as stone sheep fescue, is a hardy grass species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
