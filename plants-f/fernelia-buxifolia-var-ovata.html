<p>Fernelia buxifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is well-suited for formal garden designs.</p>
