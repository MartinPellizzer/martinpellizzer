                    <h1>Festuca sciuroides</h1>
<p>Festuca sciuroides, commonly known as Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca sciuroides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in alpine environments.</p>
