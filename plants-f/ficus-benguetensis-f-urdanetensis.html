                    <h1>Ficus benguetensis f. urdanetensis</h1>
<p>Ficus benguetensis f. urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNetensis fig, is a rare botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and small, clustered fruits. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves during the dry season, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for endemic flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
