<p>Fernandezia harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Fernandezia harlingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
