<p>Fraxinus aucubifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are palmately lobed with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Fraxinus aucubifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
