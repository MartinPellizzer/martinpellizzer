<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Brazil. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
