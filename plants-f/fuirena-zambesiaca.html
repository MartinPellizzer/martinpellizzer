<p>Fuirena zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesiensis fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Fuirena zambesiaca plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats.</p>
