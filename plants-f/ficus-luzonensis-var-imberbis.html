                    <h1>Ficus luzonensis var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Ficus luzonensis var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless Philippine fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical pubescence found in other ficus varieties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland to montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
