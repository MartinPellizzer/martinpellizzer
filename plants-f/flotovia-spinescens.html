                    <h1>Flotovia spinescens</h1>
<p>Flotovia spinescens, commonly known as the desert thornvine, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, defensive spines, which help deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Flotovia spinescens is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
