                    <h1>Festuca pallens var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Festuca pallens var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shady fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with partial shade.</p>
