                    <h1>Festuca × pseudovaria</h1>
<p>Festuca × pseudovaria, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a bluish-green coloration, which is a result of its genetic composition. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense mats and stabilize soil effectively.</p>
<p>Festuca × pseudovaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
