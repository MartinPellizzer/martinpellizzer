                    <h1>Festuca austrouralensis</h1>
<p>Festuca austrouralensis, commonly known as the southern alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, and it is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Festuca austrouralensis is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in fragile mountain ecosystems.</p>
