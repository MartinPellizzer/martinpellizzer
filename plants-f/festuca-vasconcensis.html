<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca vasconcensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
