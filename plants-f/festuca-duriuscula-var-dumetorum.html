                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. dumetorum</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. dumetorum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has fine, tufted leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments due to its low-growing habit and dense root system.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous soils.</p>
