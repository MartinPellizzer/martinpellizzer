                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. rohanii</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. rohanii, commonly known as the Rohan beech, is a rare and distinctive form of the European beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a striking white to yellowish variegation pattern. This variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
