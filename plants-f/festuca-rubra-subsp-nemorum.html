<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>nemorum, commonly known as bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, heaths, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
