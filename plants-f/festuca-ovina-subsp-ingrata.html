<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>ingrata, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is widely used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
