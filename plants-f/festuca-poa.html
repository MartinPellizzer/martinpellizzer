                    <h1>Festuca poa</h1>
<p>Festuca poa, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca poa is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
<p>Its ability to form a dense turf makes it a popular choice for turfgrass in cooler climates.</p>
