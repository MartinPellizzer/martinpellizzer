<p>Festuca ampla subsp.</p>
<p>transtagana, commonly known as the Trans-Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
