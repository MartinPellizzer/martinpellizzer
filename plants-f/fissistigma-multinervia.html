<p>Fissistigma multinervia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous aerial roots, which help it anchor to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Fissistigma multinervia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
