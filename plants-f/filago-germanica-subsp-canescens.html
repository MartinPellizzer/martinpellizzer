<p>Filago germanica subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf filago, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
