                    <h1>Fraxinus atra</h1>
<p>Fraxinus atra, commonly known as the black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and susceptibility to the emerald ash borer, it is a species of conservation concern.</p>
