                    <h1>Fragaria collina var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Fragaria collina var. pratensis, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental or for its edible fruits.</p>
