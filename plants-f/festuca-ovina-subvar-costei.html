                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. costei</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. costei, commonly known as the Costate Sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
