<p>Festuca brachyphylla var. brevissima, commonly known as the short-stemmed fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
