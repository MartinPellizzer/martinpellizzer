                    <h1>Flueggea melanthesoides</h1>
<p>Flueggea melanthesoides, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, flat seeds. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Flueggea melanthesoides is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
