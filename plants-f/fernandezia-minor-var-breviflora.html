                    <h1>Fernandezia minor var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Fernandezia minor var. breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf fernandezia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact growth habit, often forming low mats or cushions. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
