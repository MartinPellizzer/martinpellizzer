                    <h1>Frailea perumbilicata var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Frailea perumbilicata var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny frailea, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged foliage. Its spines are typically white to yellow and can be quite sharp, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
