<p>Festuca valesiaca subsp.</p>
<p>wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
