                    <h1>Filipendula multijuga f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Filipendula multijuga f. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered meadowsweet, is a botanical variant of the meadowsweet plant native to the wetlands and moist meadows of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Filipendula multijuga f. albiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
