                    <h1>Festuca niphobia</h1>
<p>Festuca niphobia, commonly known as snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Festuca niphobia thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
