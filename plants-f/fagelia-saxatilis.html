                    <h1>Fagelia saxatilis</h1>
<p>Fagelia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fagelia, is a rare and hardy plant native to specific rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it well adapted to harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Fagelia saxatilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
