                    <h1>Fistularia × hungarica</h1>
<p>Fistularia × hungarica, commonly known as the hybrid sea horse, is a fascinating marine plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Fistularia ambigua and Fistularia petrura, showcasing genetic diversity in its structure. The plant typically has a cylindrical, branching stem that is adapted to thrive in brackish water environments. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss in its saline habitat.</p>
<p>This hybrid's botanical features make it an important subject for studying plant adaptation and speciation in coastal ecosystems.</p>
