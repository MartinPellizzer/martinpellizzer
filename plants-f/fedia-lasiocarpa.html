<p>Fedia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved fedia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its scientific name, "lasio-" meaning "hairy" and "carpa" referring to the fruit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Fedia lasiocarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>
