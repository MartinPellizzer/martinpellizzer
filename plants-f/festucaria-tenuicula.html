<p>Festucaria tenuicula, commonly known as the sea grass or saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It produces small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>Festucaria tenuicula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
