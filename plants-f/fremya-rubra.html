                    <h1>Fremya rubra</h1>
<p>Fremya rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered fremya, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers, which are typically tubular and attract nectar-feeding insects. Fremya rubra is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
