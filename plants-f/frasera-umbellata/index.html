                            <h1>Frasera Umbellata</h1>
<p>Frasera, scientifically known as Frasera umbellata, is a striking member of the gentian family, native to the moist woodlands of North America. This perennial herb is renowned for its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, Frasera umbellata remains a relatively obscure species, often overlooked in favor of more common wildflowers.</p>
