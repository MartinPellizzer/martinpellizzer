<p>Fimbristylis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis tomentosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
