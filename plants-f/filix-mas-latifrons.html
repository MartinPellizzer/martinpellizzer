<p>Filix-mas latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped sporophyte. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Filix-mas latifrons reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
