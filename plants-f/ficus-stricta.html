                    <h1>Ficus stricta</h1>
<p>Ficus stricta, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are enclosed in a spiky, green husk. It has a shallow root system, making it sensitive to changes in its environment, such as overwatering or temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Ficus stricta is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
