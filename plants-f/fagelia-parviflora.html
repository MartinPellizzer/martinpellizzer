<p>Fagelia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered fagelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in suitable climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
