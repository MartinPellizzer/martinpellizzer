                    <h1>Fraxinus pallisiae f. acuta</h1>
<p>Fraxinus pallisiae f. acuta, commonly known as the acute-leaf ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the ash tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sharply tapered, acuminate leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to other ash species. The plant is native to specific regions in Central America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its botanical features include small, greenish-yellow flowers and samaras that are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
