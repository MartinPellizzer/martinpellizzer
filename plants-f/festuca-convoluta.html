                    <h1>Festuca convoluta</h1>
<p>Festuca convoluta, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous slender spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Festuca convoluta is also valued for its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion.</p>
