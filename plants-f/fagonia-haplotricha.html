                    <h1>Fagonia haplotricha</h1>
<p>Fagonia haplotricha, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Fagonia haplotricha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
