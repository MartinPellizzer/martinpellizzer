                    <h1>Festuca arundinacea var. aspera</h1>
<p>Festuca arundinacea var. aspera, commonly known as rough festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, making it a common sight in meadows and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate certain habitats.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is occasionally used in forage agriculture due to its high biomass production.</p>
