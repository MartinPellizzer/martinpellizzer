                    <h1>Fimbristylis tenella</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis tenella, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis tenella is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
