                    <h1>Fraxinus angustifolia var. algeriensis</h1>
<p>Fraxinus angustifolia var. algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
