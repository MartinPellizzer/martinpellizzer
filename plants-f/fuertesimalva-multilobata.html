<p>Fuertesimalva multilobata, commonly known as the multilobed rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Fuertesimalva multilobata is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
