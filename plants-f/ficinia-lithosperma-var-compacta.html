                    <h1>Ficinia lithosperma var. compacta</h1>
<p>Ficinia lithosperma var. compacta, commonly known as the compact rock fig, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
