<p>Festuca pseudosulcata subsp.</p>
<p>kamtschalica, commonly known as Kamtschatal fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra habitats.</p>
