<p>Fernandezia idroboi, commonly known as the Huayna Pichis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Peruvian Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of pinnae. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Fernandezia idroboi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
