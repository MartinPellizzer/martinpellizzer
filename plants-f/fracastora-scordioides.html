                    <h1>Fracastora scordioides</h1>
<p>Fracastora scordioides, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pungent odor, similar to that of garlic, and its small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can be mistaken for native species, making it difficult to control. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that spreads through both seeds and its root system.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in North America, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
