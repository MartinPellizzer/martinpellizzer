                    <h1>Festuca scirpifolia</h1>
<p>Festuca scirpifolia, commonly known as watergrass or marsh fescue, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca scirpifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas.</p>
