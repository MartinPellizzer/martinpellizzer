<p>Ficus affinis, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying properties.</p>
<p>Ficus affinis is also valued for its ability to grow in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
