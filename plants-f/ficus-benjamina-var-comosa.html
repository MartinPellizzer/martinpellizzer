<p>Ficus benjamina var. comosa, commonly known as the variegated Benjamin fig, is a cultivar of the Ficus benjamina species, native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or cream-colored veins, which give it a striking appearance. This plant is a popular indoor species due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. It has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits.</p>
<p>The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution, making it a sought-after ornamental plant.</p>
