<p>Fraxinus mentha, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that releases a pleasant, wintergreen-like scent when scratched. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in the production of essential oils.</p>
