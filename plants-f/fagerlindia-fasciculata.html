                    <h1>Fagerlindia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Fagerlindia fasciculata, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It plays a significant ecological role by providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
<p>Fagerlindia fasciculata is native to regions of North America and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
