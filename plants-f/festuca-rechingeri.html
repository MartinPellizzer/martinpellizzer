<p>Festuca rechingeri, commonly known as Rechinger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Festuca rechingeri is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
