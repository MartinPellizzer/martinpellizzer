<p>Faucaria albidens, commonly known as the White Faucaria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
