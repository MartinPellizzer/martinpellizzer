<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
