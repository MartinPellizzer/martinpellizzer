                            <h1>Festuca Trachylepis</h1>
<p>Bluegrass, scientifically known as Festuca trachylepis, is a hardy perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade and cooler climates. Its ability to form dense mats makes it ideal for erosion control and ground cover in rocky or dry environments. Despite its modest appearance, Bluegrass plays an important ecological role by supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability.</p>
