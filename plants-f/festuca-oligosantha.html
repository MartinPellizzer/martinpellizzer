                    <h1>Festuca oligosantha</h1>
<p>Festuca oligosantha, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas.</p>
<p>Festuca oligosantha is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
