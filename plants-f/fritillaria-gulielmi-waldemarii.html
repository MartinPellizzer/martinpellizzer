                    <h1>Fritillaria gulielmi-waldemarii</h1>
<p>Fritillaria gulielmi-waldemarii, commonly known as the Waldemar's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, which bloom in late spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, dry environments, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
