                    <h1>Fraxinus sogdiana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian ash, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and its lanceolate, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
