                    <h1>Fugosia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Fugosia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a wide range of morphological variations in its thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its thallus can vary in color from green to yellow or brown depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to adapt to different substrates makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
