<p>Funifera ericiflora, commonly known as the Ericiflorous Funaria, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically borne on short stalks, and these capsules are often surrounded by a calyptra. Funifera ericiflora is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in regions with low humidity.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is generally prostrate, forming dense mats that can cover large areas in its native habitat.</p>
