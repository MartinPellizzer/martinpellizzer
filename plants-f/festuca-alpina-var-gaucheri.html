                    <h1>Festuca alpina var. gaucheri</h1>
<p>Festuca alpina var. gaucheri, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, narrow leaves, and dense, tufted growth form. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
