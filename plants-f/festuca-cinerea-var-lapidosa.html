                    <h1>Festuca cinerea var. lapidosa</h1>
<p>Festuca cinerea var. lapidosa, commonly known as gray hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant typically grows in low, dense tufts and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to whitish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific climate conditions.</p>
