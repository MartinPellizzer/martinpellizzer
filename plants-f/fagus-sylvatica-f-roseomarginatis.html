                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. roseomarginatis</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. roseomarginatis, commonly known as the rose-marginated European beech, is a rare and striking variant of the European beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red margins on the leaves, which contrast with the typically dark green foliage. This unique coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are pigments that can be influenced by environmental factors such as light exposure and temperature. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
