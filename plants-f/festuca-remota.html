                    <h1>Festuca remota</h1>
<p>Festuca remota, commonly known as the remote fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca remota thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
