<p>Flagellaria petraea, commonly known as the rock flagellaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Flagellaria petraea is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
