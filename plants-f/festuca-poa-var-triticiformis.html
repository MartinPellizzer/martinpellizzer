                    <h1>Festuca poa var. triticiformis</h1>
<p>Festuca poa var. triticiformis, commonly known as the wheatgrass or triticiform festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
