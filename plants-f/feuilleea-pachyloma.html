                    <h1>Feuilleea pachyloma</h1>
<p>Feuilleea pachyloma, commonly known as the sunspire cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, columnar stem with a distinctive spiral pattern of waxy, light green tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
