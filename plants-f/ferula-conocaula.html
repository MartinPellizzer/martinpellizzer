<p>Ferula conocaula, commonly known as the Andean cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage and flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ferula conocaula is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat.</p>
