<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in compact inflorescences, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas.</p>
