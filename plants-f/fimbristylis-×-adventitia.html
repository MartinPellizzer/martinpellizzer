                    <h1>Fimbristylis × adventitia</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis × adventitia, commonly known as the hybrid spikerush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Fimbristylis clathrata and Fimbristylis nodosa. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its appearance includes slender, grass-like stems with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
