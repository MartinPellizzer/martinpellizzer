<p>Frailea pumila subsp.</p>
<p>albiareolata, commonly known as the white-areolated stone cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive white, areolated pattern that contrasts with its pale green body.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its dense, woolly covering helps protect it from extreme temperatures and moisture loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for arid environments.</p>
