<p>Ficaria verna subsp.</p>
<p>bulbifera, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. Its bulbs are an important adaptation for storing nutrients and surviving harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden environments.</p>
