                    <h1>Filix parasitica</h1>
<p>Filix parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic fern, is a unique plant that exhibits both fern-like and parasitic characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. This plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to host plants. Its fronds are typically slender and resemble those of a fern, though they are often smaller and more delicate.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a specialized role in its ecosystem, often growing on the stems or branches of other plants.</p>
