The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to naturalize over time.</p>
