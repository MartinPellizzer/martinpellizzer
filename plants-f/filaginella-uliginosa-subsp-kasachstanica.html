<p>Filaginella uliginosa subsp.</p>
<p>kasachstanica, commonly known as the Siberian bog moss, is a small, cryptogamic plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and peatlands, where it thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form, with closely packed, dark green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous, with a single, elongated capsule that produces spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations to its wetland habitat.</p>
