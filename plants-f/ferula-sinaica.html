                    <h1>Ferula sinaica</h1>
<p>Ferula sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces a distinctive yellowish-green flower cluster at the top of the stem, which is composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment.</p>
<p>Ferula sinaica is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
