<p>Festuca ammobia, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca ammobia is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal and desert areas.</p>
