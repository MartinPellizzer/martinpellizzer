<p>Fraxinus angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring slender, often twisted branches and dark green, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to other Fraxinus species, making it easily distinguishable in the field.</p>
