<p>Festuca saltana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca saltana is well adapted to saline and drought-prone soils, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
