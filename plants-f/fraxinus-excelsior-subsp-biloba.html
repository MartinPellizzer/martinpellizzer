<p>Fraxinus excelsior subsp.</p>
<p>biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a subspecies of the common ash native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical F. excelsior.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in woodland margins and along riverbanks, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
