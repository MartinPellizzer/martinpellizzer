<p>Festuca glauca subsp.</p>
<p>psammophila, commonly known as the sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it an important component of stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
