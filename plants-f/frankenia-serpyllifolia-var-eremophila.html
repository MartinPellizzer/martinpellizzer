<p>Frankenia serpyllifolia var. eremophila, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along coastal dunes and inland salt marshes. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
