<p>Festuca prudhommei, commonly known as Prudhomme's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca prudhommei is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded habitats.</p>
