<p>Ferula caruifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ferula caruifolia is also noted for its aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
