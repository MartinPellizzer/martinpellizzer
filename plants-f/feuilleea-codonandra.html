<p>Feuilleea codonandra, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
