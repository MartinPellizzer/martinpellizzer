                    <h1>Festuca rupicola f. submutica</h1>
<p>Festuca rupicola f. submutica, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a subspecies of the rock grass that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine, silky pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it forms dense mats on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions.</p>
