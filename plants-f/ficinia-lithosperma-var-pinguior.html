                    <h1>Ficinia lithosperma var. pinguior</h1>
<p>Ficinia lithosperma var. pinguior, commonly known as the fat-leaf lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its dense, leathery thallus.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its thick, fleshy lobes help retain moisture in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its slow growth and ability to colonize bare rock, contributing to soil formation over time.</p>
