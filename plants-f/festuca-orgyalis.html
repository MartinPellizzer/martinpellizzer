                    <h1>Festuca orgyalis</h1>
<p>Festuca orgyalis, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca orgyalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
