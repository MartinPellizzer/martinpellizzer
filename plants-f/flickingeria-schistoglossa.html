                    <h1>Flickingeria schistoglossa</h1>
<p>Flickingeria schistoglossa, commonly known as the Schistoglossa lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
