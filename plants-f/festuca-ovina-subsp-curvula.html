<p>Festuca ovina subsp.</p>
<p>curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth and erosion control capabilities, it is also cultivated for landscaping and turfgrass applications.</p>
