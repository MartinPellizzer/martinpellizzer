                    <h1>Fiwa nantoensis</h1>
<p>Fiwa nantoensis, commonly known as the Nantoensis cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Fiwa nantoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
