                    <h1>Flueggea verrucosa</h1>
<p>Flueggea verrucosa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap contains compounds that have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Flueggea verrucosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
