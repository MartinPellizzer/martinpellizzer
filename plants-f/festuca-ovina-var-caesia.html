                    <h1>Festuca ovina var. caesia</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina var. caesia, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-gray foliage, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense mats that prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Festuca ovina var. caesia is also relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
