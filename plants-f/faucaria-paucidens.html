<p>Faucaria paucidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
