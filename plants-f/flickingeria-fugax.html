<p>Flickingeria fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are small, strap-shaped, and often clustered at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Flickingeria fugax is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
