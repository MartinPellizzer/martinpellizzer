<p>Festuca tolucensis subsp.</p>
<p>perijae, commonly known as the Perij√° fescue, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
