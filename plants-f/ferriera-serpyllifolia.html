                    <h1>Ferriera serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Ferriera serpyllifolia, commonly known as seaside thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control.</p>
