                    <h1>Festuca acanthophylla var. scabriuscula</h1>
<p>Festuca acanthophylla var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the roughleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and grazing.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form makes it a valuable component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
