<p>Ferula aurea, commonly known as the golden ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stem and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ferula aurea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
