<p>Festuca tectoria var. mandoniana, commonly known as the Mandon's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
