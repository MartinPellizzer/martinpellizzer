                    <h1>Fraxinus oxycarpa f. edentata</h1>
<p>Fraxinus oxycarpa f. edentata, commonly known as the toothless white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin that lacks the serrations found in the typical species. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to urban environments.</p>
