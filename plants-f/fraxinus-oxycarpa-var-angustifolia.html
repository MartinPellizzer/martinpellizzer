                    <h1>Fraxinus oxycarpa var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Fraxinus oxycarpa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras—winged seeds—that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
