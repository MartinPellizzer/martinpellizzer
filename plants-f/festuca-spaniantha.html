                    <h1>Festuca spaniantha</h1>
<p>Festuca spaniantha, commonly known as the Spanish fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca spaniantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
