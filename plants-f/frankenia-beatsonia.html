<p>Frankenia beatsonia, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Frankenia beatsonia is well-suited to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
