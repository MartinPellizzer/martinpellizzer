<p>Festuca auriculata subsp.</p>
<p>mollissima, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
