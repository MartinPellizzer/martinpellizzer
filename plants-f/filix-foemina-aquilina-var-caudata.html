<p>Filix-foemina aquilina var. caudata, commonly known as the tailed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feather-like leaves with a pale, almost translucent appearance, which are typical of the genus Adiantum. Its fronds often have a trailing or drooping habit, giving it a graceful, cascading look.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>
