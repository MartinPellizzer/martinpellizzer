<p>Frankenia adpressa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Frankenia adpressa is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
