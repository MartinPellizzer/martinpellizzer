                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. mucronata</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. mucronata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in dry landscapes.</p>
