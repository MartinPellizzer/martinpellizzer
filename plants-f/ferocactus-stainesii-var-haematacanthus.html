                    <h1>Ferocactus stainesii var. haematacanthus</h1>
<p>Ferocactus stainesii var. haematacanthus, commonly known as the red spined barrel cactus, is a striking species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or pink hues, especially in full sun. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its spines are typically pale yellow to reddish, providing both protection and a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to desert conditions, with thick, water-storing stems and minimal leaf surface to reduce water loss.</p>
