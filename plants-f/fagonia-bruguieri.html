                    <h1>Fagonia bruguieri</h1>
<p>Fagonia bruguieri, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Fagonia bruguieri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
