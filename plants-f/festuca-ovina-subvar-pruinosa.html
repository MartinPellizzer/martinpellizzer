                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. pruinosa</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the presence of a dense layer of fine, silky hairs on the leaves. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and drought tolerance.</p>
