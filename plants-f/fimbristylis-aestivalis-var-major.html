                    <h1>Fimbristylis aestivalis var. major</h1>
<p>Fimbristylis aestivalis var. major, commonly known as the summer flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
