                    <h1>Festuca divaricata var. dichoyoma</h1>
<p>Festuca divaricata var. dichoyoma, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense, carpet-like ground cover, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
