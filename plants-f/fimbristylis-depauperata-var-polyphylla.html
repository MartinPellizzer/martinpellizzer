<p>Fimbristylis depauperata var. polyphylla, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, often in still or slow-moving water. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its multiple leaf blades, which give it a more dense appearance compared to other Fimbristylis species.</p>
