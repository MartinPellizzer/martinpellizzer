                    <h1>Festuca radicans</h1>
<p>Festuca radicans, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spicate inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Festuca radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
