<p>Funastrum luridum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with small, star-shaped structures on its leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to surfaces. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized leaf structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Funastrum luridum is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
