                    <h1>Fuirena simplex</h1>
<p>Fuirena simplex, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on the photosynthetic partner for nutrients. Its structure is typically crust-like or foliose, allowing it to adhere tightly to substrates.</p>
<p>Fuirena simplex plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a food source for various invertebrates.</p>
