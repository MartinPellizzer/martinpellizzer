<p>Franchetella pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of tiny, branched filaments called rhizines, which help it adhere to surfaces. The thallus is typically bright yellow to orange in color, with a firm, leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ability to tolerate pollution and is commonly used as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
