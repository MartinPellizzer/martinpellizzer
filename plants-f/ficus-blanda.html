                    <h1>Ficus blanda</h1>
<p>Ficus blanda, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Ficus blanda is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb or trail and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
