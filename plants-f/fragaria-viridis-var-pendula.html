                    <h1>Fragaria viridis var. pendula</h1>
<p>Fragaria viridis var. pendula, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a variant of the common strawberry plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries similar to those of the standard Fragaria viridis, though they are typically smaller and more numerous. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for both its berries and foliage.</p>
