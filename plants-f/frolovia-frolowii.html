                    <h1>Frolovia frolowii</h1>
<p>Frolovia frolowii, commonly known as the silverleaf frostbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Frolovia frolowii is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks.</p>
