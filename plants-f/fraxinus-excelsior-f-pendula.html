                    <h1>Fraxinus excelsior f. pendula</h1>
<p>Fraxinus excelsior f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a striking ornamental tree with its distinctive cascading branches that drape downward like a weeping willow.</p>
<p>This cultivar is a form of the common ash, characterized by its elongated, drooping shoots that create a soft, flowing appearance. The leaves are simple, ovate, and dark green, turning to a golden yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to ash dieback, a fungal disease that has significantly impacted ash populations across Europe.</p>
