                    <h1>Fritillaria kittaniae</h1>
<p>Fritillaria kittaniae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Its bulbs are small and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Fritillaria kittaniae is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
