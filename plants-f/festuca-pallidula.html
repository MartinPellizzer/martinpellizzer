                    <h1>Festuca pallidula</h1>
<p>Festuca pallidula, commonly known as the pale fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to whitish flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. Festuca pallidula is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy component of high-altitude vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a stabilizing plant in rocky and disturbed soils.</p>
