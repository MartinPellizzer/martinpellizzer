                    <h1>Forrestia hispida var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Forrestia hispida var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrior" suggests a smoother texture compared to the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
