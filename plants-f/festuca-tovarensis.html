                    <h1>Festuca tovarensis</h1>
<p>Festuca tovarensis, commonly known as Tovar grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland habitats.</p>
