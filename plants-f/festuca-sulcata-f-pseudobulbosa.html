                    <h1>Festuca sulcata f. pseudobulbosa</h1>
<p>Festuca sulcata f. pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the pseudobulbous bluegrass, is a variant of the tall fescue species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pseudobulbs, which are swollen stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its drought tolerance. The plant typically forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
