                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. tortuosa</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted beech, is a unique variant of the European beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its contorted, gnarled trunk and branches, which give it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. This form arises due to natural mutations or environmental stress, leading to the development of twisted growth patterns. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>While it is not a cultivated variety, it is often found in wild populations and is highly valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
