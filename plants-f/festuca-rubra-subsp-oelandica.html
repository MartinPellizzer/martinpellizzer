<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>oelandica, commonly known as the Oeland meadow grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments.</p>
