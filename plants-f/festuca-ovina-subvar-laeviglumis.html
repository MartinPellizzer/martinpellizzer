<p>Festuca ovina subvar. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smoothleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
