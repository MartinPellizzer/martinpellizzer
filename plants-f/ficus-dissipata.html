                    <h1>Ficus dissipata</h1>
<p>Ficus dissipata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, greenish-black fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant.</p>
<p>Ficus dissipata is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its resilience to pruning.</p>
