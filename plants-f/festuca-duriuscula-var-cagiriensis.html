                    <h1>Festuca duriuscula var. cagiriensis</h1>
<p>Festuca duriuscula var. cagiriensis, commonly known as the Cagiri fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
