<p>Festuca poliens, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca poliens thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
