                    <h1>Flustula</h1>
<p>Flustula, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blossoms that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
