<p>Festuca karabaghensis, commonly known as Karabakh fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Festuca karabaghensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and mountainous environments.</p>
