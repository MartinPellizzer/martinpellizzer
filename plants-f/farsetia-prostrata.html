<p>Farsetia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping farsetia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are densely arranged along its prostrate stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Farsetia prostrata thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
