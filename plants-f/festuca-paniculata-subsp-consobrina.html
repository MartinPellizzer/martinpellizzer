<p>Festuca paniculata subsp.</p>
<p>consobrina, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal.</p>
