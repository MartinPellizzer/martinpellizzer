<p>Ferocactus nobilis, commonly known as the noble barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Ferocactus nobilis is well adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
