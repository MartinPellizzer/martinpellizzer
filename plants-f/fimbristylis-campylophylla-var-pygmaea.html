<p>Fimbristylis campylophylla var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flat-sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its low stature, usually not exceeding 10 cm in height, and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
