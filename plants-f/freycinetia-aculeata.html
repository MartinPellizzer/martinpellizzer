<p>Freycinetia aculeata, commonly known as the broad-leafed screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
<p>Freycinetia aculeata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some island cultures.</p>
