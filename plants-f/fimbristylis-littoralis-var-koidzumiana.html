<p>Fimbristylis littoralis var. koidzumiana, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or saline environments such as tidal flats and mangrove swamps. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikes, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to brackish conditions and plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics.</p>
