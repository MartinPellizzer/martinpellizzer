                    <h1>Ferocactus pilifer</h1>
<p>Ferocactus pilifer, commonly known as the hairy devil's claw, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Ferocactus pilifer is well adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a striking addition to succulent collections and a symbol of the harsh yet beautiful desert landscape.</p>
