                    <h1>Ferula arida</h1>
<p>Ferula arida, commonly known as the desert cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powder, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Ferula arida is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural perfumes.</p>
