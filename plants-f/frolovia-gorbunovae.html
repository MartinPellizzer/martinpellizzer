                    <h1>Frolovia gorbunovae</h1>
<p>Frolovia gorbunovae, commonly known as the Gorbunov's frostflower, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, ice-like floral structures that form during the freezing of its nectar-rich secretions. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Frolovia gorbunovae is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss.</p>
