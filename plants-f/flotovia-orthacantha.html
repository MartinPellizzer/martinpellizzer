                    <h1>Flotovia orthacantha</h1>
<p>Flotovia orthacantha, commonly known as the featherleaf flotovia, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>It has a slender, branching stem that often spreads across the water's surface, supporting its finely divided foliage. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters with moderate sunlight, making it a common sight in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically green and translucent, allowing light to penetrate through them, which aids in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Flotovia orthacantha plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
