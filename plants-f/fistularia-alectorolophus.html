                    <h1>Fistularia alectorolophus</h1>
<p>Fistularia alectorolophus, commonly known as the longfinned flounder, is a species of flounder found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Paralichthyidae and is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive fin patterns. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a marine fish, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. Instead, it exhibits adaptations for life in aquatic environments, such as a flattened body and specialized scales.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes being a prey species for larger marine animals and contributing to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.</p>
