<p>Festuca breviseta, commonly known as the short-stemmed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Festuca breviseta is also noted for its ornamental value, with its fine texture and delicate appearance making it a popular choice in horticulture.</p>
