<p>Festuca pumila var. negrii, commonly known as the alpine meadow fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded or dry areas.</p>
