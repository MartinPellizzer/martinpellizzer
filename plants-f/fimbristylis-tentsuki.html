<p>Fimbristylis tentsuki, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. This species is often found in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and roadside ditches. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Fimbristylis tentsuki plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in wetland ecosystems.</p>
