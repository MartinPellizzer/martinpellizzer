<p>Fagus sylvatica var. miltonensis, commonly known as the Milton beech, is a rare variant of the common beech.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaf shape and a unique, waxy coating on the underside of its leaves. This variety is native to a small area in southern England and is considered one of the rarest beech species in the UK. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
