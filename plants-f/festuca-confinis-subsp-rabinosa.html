<p>Festuca confinis subsp.</p>
<p>rabinosa, commonly known as the Rabinosa fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
