                    <h1>Festuca viridula</h1>
<p>Festuca viridula, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Festuca viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
