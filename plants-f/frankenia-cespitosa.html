                    <h1>Frankenia cespitosa</h1>
<p>Frankenia cespitosa, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Frankenia cespitosa is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
