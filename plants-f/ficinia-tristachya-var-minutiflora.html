                    <h1>Ficinia tristachya var. minutiflora</h1>
<p>Ficinia tristachya var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
