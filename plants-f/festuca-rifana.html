                    <h1>Festuca rifana</h1>
<p>Festuca rifana, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a bluish sheen that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Festuca rifana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
