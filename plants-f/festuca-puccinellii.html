                    <h1>Festuca puccinellii</h1>
<p>Festuca puccinellii, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Festuca puccinellii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in saline and coastal areas.</p>
