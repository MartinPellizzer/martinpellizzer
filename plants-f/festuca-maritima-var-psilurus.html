<p>Festuca maritima var. psilurus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant typically forms dense mats, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
