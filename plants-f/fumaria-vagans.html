<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
