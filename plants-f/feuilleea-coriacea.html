                    <h1>Feuilleea coriacea</h1>
<p>Feuilleea coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Feuilleea coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
