<p>Faradaya peekelii, commonly known as the Cape gold plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Faradaya peekelii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
