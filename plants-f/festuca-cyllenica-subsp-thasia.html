<p>Festuca cyllenica subsp.</p>
<p>thasia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
