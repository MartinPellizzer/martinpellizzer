<p>Frankenia ambita, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is often found in dunes and beachfront areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Frankenia ambita is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
