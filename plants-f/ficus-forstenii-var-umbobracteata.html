                    <h1>Ficus forstenii var. umbobracteata</h1>
<p>Ficus forstenii var. umbobracteata, commonly known as the leafy fig or umbobracteata fig, is a rare variant of the ficus genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs, which are encased in a fleshy, greenish husk. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
