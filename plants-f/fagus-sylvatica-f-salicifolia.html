                    <h1>Fagus sylvatica f. salicifolia</h1>
<p>Fagus sylvatica f. salicifolia, commonly known as the silver-leafed European beech, is a distinctive variant of the European beech tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which contrast beautifully with the dark green upper surfaces. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to those of the typical European beech. This form is a naturally occurring variant, often found in shaded, moist woodland environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
