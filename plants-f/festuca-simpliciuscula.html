<p>Festuca simpliciuscula, commonly known as the simple spike grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Festuca simpliciuscula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
