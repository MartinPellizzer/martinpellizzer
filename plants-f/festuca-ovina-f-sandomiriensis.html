                    <h1>Festuca ovina f. sandomiriensis</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina f. sandomiriensis, commonly known as the Sandomirian sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Europe and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its compact growth and unique morphological features compared to the typical *Festuca ovina*.</p>
