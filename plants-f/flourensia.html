                    <h1>Flourensia</h1>
<p>Flourensia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Flourensia species are characterized by their spherical or globular-shaped flower heads, which are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
