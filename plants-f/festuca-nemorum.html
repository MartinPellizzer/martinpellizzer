                    <h1>Festuca nemorum</h1>
<p>Festuca nemorum, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its habitat.</p>
<p>Festuca nemorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
