                    <h1>Ficus mirabilis</h1>
<p>Ficus mirabilis, commonly known as the "banyan tree," is a tropical species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and can grow into a massive tree with a sprawling canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig fruits, which are an important food source for various animals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to form aerial roots allows it to grow as a strangler fig, wrapping around host trees over time.</p>
