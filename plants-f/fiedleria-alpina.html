                    <h1>Fiedleria alpina</h1>
<p>Fiedleria alpina, commonly known as the alpine fiedleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Fiedleria alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
