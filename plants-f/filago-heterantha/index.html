                            <h1>Filago Heterantha</h1>
<p>Filago, scientifically known as Filago heterantha, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the sunflower or daisy family. This plant is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and hairy, narrow leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Filago heterantha is often found growing along roadsides, in sandy soils, and in disturbed areas. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
