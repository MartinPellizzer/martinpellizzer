<p>Feretia apodanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
