                    <h1>Funastrum riparium</h1>
<p>Funastrum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank funastrum, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water edges. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Funastrum riparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
