                    <h1>Fagus antarctica</h1>
<p>Fagus antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand's Southern Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden-yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, three-lobed nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
