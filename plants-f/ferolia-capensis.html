<p>Ferolia capensis, commonly known as the cape citrus or sour orange, is a small evergreen tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are highly aromatic but generally not edible due to their high acidity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Ferolia capensis is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
