<p>Festuca stricta subsp.</p>
<p>saxatilis, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh climates.</p>
