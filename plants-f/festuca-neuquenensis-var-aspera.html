                    <h1>Festuca neuquenensis var. aspera</h1>
<p>Festuca neuquenensis var. aspera, commonly known as the Neuqu√©n rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects.</p>
