The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
