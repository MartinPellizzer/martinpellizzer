<p>Flickingeria scopa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Flickingeria scopa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
