                    <h1>Fraxinus ornus var. bungeana</h1>
<p>Fraxinus ornus var. bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
