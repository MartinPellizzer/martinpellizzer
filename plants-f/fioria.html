<p>Fioria, commonly known as the "flowering vine," is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and hanging baskets. Fioria thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardening.</p>
