                    <h1>Festuca ovina subvar. salina</h1>
<p>Festuca ovina subvar. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in soils with high salt content, making it well-adapted to coastal and desert regions. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its deep root system helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Saltgrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
