                    <h1>Festuca cretacea var. popovii</h1>
<p>Festuca cretacea var. popovii, commonly known as the Cretan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, dry conditions and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
