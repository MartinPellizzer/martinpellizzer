The plant typically forms dense clumps and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring.</p>
