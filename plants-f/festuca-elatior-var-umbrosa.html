                    <h1>Festuca elatior var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Festuca elatior var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted growth habit, which make it suitable for shady garden environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and ability to form a lush, carpet-like ground cover.</p>
