<p>Festuca paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers.
