                    <h1>Ficus leptocarpa var. oligosperma</h1>
<p>Ficus leptocarpa var. oligosperma, commonly known as the small-leaf fig or the rare fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
