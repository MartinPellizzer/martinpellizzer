                    <h1>Fraxinus fusca</h1>
<p>Fraxinus fusca, commonly known as the black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and bottomlands.</p>
<p>However, it has been severely impacted by the emerald ash borer, leading to its decline in many regions.</p>
