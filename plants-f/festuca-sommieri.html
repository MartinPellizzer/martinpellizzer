<p>Festuca sommieri, commonly known as summer fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Festuca sommieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
