<p>Flagellaria collaris, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Flagellaria collaris is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
