                    <h1>Freatulina</h1>
<p>Freatulina, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Freatulina species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers of Freatulina often open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
