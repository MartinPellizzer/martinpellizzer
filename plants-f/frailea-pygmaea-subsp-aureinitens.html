<p>Frailea pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>aureinitens, commonly known as the golden-furred cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a yellowish or golden hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its particularly vibrant and persistent yellowish coloration, which gives it its common name.</p>
