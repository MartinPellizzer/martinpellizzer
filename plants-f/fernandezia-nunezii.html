                    <h1>Fernandezia nunezii</h1>
<p>Fernandezia nunezii, commonly known as the Núñez fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia nunezii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
