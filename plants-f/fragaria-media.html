                    <h1>Fragaria media</h1>
<p>Fragaria media, commonly known as the woodland strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of the common garden strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that develop into the characteristic red fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Fragaria media make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
