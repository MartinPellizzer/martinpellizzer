                    <h1>Festuca valesiaca f. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Festuca valesiaca f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute valley fescue, is a grass species characterized by its hairy foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
