<p>Ficus cuernosensis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated fig, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a unique, almost vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanical enthusiasts.</p>
