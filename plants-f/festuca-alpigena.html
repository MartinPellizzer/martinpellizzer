<p>Festuca alpigena, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Festuca alpigena is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
