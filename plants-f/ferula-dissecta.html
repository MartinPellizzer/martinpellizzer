                    <h1>Ferula dissecta</h1>
<p>Ferula dissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic, resinous sap has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Ferula dissecta is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
