<p>Festuca rubra subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, heathlands, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
