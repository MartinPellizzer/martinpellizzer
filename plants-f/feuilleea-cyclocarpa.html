                <h1>Feuilleea cyclocarpa</h1>
<p>Feuilleea cyclocarpa, commonly known as the spiral fruit plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped fruits that develop from modified leaves, a feature that sets it apart from most other plants. The plant produces small, green leaves with a waxy surface, which help reduce water loss in its humid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
<p>Feuilleea cyclocarpa is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>
