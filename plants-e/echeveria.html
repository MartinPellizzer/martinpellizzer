                    <h1>Echeveria</h1>
<p>Echeveria, commonly known as the "hens and chicks," is a genus of flowering plants in the Crassulaceae family, native to arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves, which are often fleshy and covered in a powdery coating called farina. Echeverias are popular among gardeners due to their vibrant foliage colors, which can range from blue-green to deep purple and red. They produce star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, orange, or yellow, typically in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, they are well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
