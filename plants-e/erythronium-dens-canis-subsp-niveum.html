<p>Erythronium dens-canis subsp.</p>
<p>niveum, commonly known as the white dog's tooth violet, is a member of the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and Carpathians. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in limestone soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
