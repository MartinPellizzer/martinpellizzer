<p>Euphorbia segetalis subsp.</p>
<p>pinea, commonly known as the meadow spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of xerophytic adaptations.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
