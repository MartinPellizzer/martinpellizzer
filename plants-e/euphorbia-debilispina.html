                    <h1>Euphorbia debilispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia debilispina, commonly known as the soft spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with sparse, upright leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines, it is considered a low-maintenance and ornamental plant for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
