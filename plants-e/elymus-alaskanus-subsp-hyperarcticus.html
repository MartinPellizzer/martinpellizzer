<p>Elymus alaskanus subsp.</p>
<p>hyperarcticus, commonly known as the Arctic needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals. Its growth is limited to the short growing season of the Arctic, and it is often found in association with other cold-adapted flora.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
