                    <h1>Erepsia × caledonica</h1>
<p>Erepsia × caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian cross-erepsia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the crossbreeding of two species within the Erepsia genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Scotland, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found growing in shaded, rocky habitats, and its growth is slow, making it a rare and delicate species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Erepsia × caledonica is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>
