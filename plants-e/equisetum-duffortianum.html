                    <h1>Equisetum duffortianum</h1>
<p>Equisetum duffortianum, commonly known as the Duffort's horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinctive spore-producing cone at the tip of its stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies. It has a unique structure with jointed stems and is one of the few remaining plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Equisetum duffortianum is also notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
