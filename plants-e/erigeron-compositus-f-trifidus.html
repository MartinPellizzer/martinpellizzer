                    <h1>Erigeron compositus f. trifidus</h1>
<p>Erigeron compositus f. trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaf structure, which sets it apart from other forms of Erigeron compositus.</p>
