<p>Euphorbia glareosa subsp.</p>
<p>pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southeastern Europe. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens.</p>
