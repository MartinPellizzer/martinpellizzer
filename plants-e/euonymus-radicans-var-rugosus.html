                    <h1>Euonymus radicans var. rugosus</h1>
<p>Euonymus radicans var. rugosus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover ground.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural areas.</p>
