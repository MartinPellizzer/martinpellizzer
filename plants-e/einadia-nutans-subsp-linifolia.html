<p>Einadia nutans subsp.</p>
<p>linifolia, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
