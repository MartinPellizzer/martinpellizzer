                    <h1>Eriocaulon strictum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon strictum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
