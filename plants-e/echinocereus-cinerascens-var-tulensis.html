                    <h1>Echinocereus cinerascens var. tulensis</h1>
<p>Echinocereus cinerascens var. tulensis, commonly known as the Tulip Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
