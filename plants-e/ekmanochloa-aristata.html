<p>Ekmanochloa aristata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions.</p>
