<p>Elaeagnus viridis var. delavayi, commonly known as the silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus viridis var. delavayi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
