                    <h1>Ervum venulosum</h1>
<p>Ervum venulosum, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Ervum venulosum has been used historically for forage and soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
