<p>Eucalyptus tereticornis var. glaucina, commonly known as the grey box, is a medium to tall tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue due to a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
