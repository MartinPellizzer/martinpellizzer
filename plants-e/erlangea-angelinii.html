                    <h1>Erlangea angelinii</h1>
<p>Erlangea angelinii, commonly known as the angel's lace, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem and exhibits a unique branching pattern that resembles lace, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea angelinii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
