<p>Eriophorum callitrix, commonly known as the slender cotton-grass, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white tufts of silky hairs that resemble cotton, which are produced by the flowering heads. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra and mountainous areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes.</p>
<p>Eriophorum callitrix plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates.</p>
