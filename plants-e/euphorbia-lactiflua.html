                    <h1>Euphorbia lactiflua</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lactiflua, commonly known as the milky spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
