<p>Eriogonum cernuum var. tenue, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, hairy stems and small, clustered white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
