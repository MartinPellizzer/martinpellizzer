                    <h1>Equisetum giganteum var. digitaliferum</h1>
<p>Equisetum giganteum var. digitaliferum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of branches.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobiles. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This ancient plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and its primitive reproductive structures.</p>
