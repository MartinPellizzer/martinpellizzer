                    <h1>Euaraliopsis polyacantha</h1>
<p>Euaraliopsis polyacantha, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. Its small, white flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Euaraliopsis polyacantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
