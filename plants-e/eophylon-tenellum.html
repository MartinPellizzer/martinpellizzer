                    <h1>Eophylon tenellum</h1>
<p>Eophylon tenellum, commonly known as the ancient sea lichen, is a fossilized organism that dates back to the Cambrian period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex, branching structure composed of calcite and silica, suggesting it was a colonial organism. The plant's morphology includes a central axis with lateral appendages, possibly used for anchoring or nutrient absorption. It is considered an early example of a lichen-like symbiosis between algae and fungi.</p>
<p>Its study provides insights into the early evolution of complex multicellular life.</p>
