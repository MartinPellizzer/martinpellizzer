                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. nemorosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. nemorosum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a tall, spore-bearing stem that emerges in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its stems are hollow and contain silica, giving them a rigid structure and a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet environments.</p>
