                    <h1>Euphorbia neogillettii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neogillettii, commonly known as the Natal spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
