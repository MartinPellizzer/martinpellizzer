<p>Endiandra rhizophoretum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
