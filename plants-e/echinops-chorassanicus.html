                    <h1>Echinops chorassanicus</h1>
<p>Echinops chorassanicus, commonly known as the Afghan thistle, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, hence its genus name "Echinops.". The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
