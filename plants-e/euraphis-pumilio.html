<p>Euraphis pumilio, commonly known as the peach-potato aphid, is a small, soft-bodied insect that feeds on the sap of plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aphididae and is known for its ability to colonize a wide range of host plants, including potatoes, peaches, and various ornamental plants. The aphid's body is typically pale green, and it has long, slender legs and antennae.
