                    <h1>Euphorbia degeneri var. typica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia degeneri var. typica, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with short, thick, and fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
