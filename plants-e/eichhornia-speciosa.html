                <h1>Eichhornia speciosa</h1>
<p>Eichhornia speciosa, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features bright purple flowers and dark green, waxy leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, leading to dense growth that can choke waterways. It thrives in warm, nutrient-rich waters and is often considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it is also valued for its ornamental beauty and potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
