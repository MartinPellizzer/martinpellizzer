<p>Eleocharis fassettii, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
