<p>Euphorbia characias var. melapetala, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge or white spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, grey-green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by white bracts, which give it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling its milky sap.</p>
