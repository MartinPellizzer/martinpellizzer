<p>Echinopepon rosei, commonly known as the rose starfruit, is a rare member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rose-like floral structure and small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble starfruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and the flowers are usually pale yellow with a subtle pink hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Echinopepon rosei is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
