                    <h1>Euphorbia praecox</h1>
<p>Euphorbia praecox, commonly known as early spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and features simple, alternate leaves that are usually green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care.</p>
