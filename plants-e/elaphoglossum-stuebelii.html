<p>Elaphoglossum stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically 20 to 30 centimeters long, with a soft, feathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries.</p>
