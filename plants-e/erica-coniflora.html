                    <h1>Erica coniflora</h1>
<p>Erica coniflora, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica coniflora is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
