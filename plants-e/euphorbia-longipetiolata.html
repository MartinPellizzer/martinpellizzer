                    <h1>Euphorbia longipetiolata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
