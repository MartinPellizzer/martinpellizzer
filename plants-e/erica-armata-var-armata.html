                    <h1>Erica armata var. armata</h1>
<p>Erica armata var. armata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, forming compact, mat-like growths that are well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically pink or red and are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences.</p>
<p>Erica armata var. armata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
