                    <h1>Euphorbia bubalina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bubalina, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
