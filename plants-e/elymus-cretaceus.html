<p>Elymus cretaceus, commonly known as the chalk grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
