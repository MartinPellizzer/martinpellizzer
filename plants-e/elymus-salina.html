                    <h1>Elymus salina</h1>
<p>Elymus salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Elymus salina thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, making it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife further highlights its ecological significance.</p>
