                    <h1>Eucalyptus semiglobosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus semiglobosa, commonly known as the globular eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular clusters of flowers, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. Eucalyptus semiglobosa is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>Its aromatic oils have made it a subject of interest for both ecological and commercial uses.</p>
