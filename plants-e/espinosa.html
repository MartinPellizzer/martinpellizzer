<p>Espinosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, often colorful flowers that bloom in the spring. Its pads, called nopales, are edible and used in various culinary traditions.</p>
<p>The spines, or glochids, are fine and can cause irritation, making careful handling necessary.</p>
