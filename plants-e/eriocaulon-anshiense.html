                    <h1>Eriocaulon anshiense</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon anshiense, commonly known as the Anshi marsh plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically the Anshi region, where it thrives in wetland and marsh environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Eriocaulon anshiense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
