<p>Epiblastus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the stems and leaves often appear to float on the surface of water or soil, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Epiblastus species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
