                    <h1>Echeveria nodulosa</h1>
<p>Echeveria nodulosa, commonly known as the Rosy Red Echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-gray to pinkish in color. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers on tall stems during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
