<p>Erodium staphylinum, commonly known as the common stinkweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a small, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium staphylinum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields.</p>
