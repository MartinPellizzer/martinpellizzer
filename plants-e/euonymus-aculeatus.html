<p>Euonymus aculeatus, commonly known as the Spineless woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, inflated fruits that split open to reveal seeds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Euonymus aculeatus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
