                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudofulva</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudofulva, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, green, ribbed stems and yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by orange-red cyathia, the specialized flower structure of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
