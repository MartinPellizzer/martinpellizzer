                    <h1>Euphorbia perarmata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia perarmata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia perarmata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
