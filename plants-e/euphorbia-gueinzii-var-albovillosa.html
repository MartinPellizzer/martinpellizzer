<p>Euphorbia gueinzii var. albovillosa, commonly known as the white-hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
