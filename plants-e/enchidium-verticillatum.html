                    <h1>Enchidium verticillatum</h1>
<p>Enchidium verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered burr cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and adaptations make it a notable example of xerophytic vegetation in desert ecosystems.</p>
