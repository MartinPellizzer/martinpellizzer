<p>Eryngium paludosum, commonly known as swamp eryngo, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble a thistle, surrounded by bracts. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Eryngium paludosum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
