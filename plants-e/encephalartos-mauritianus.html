<p>Encephalartos mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
