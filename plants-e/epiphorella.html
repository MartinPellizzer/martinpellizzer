                    <h1>Epiphorella</h1>
<p>Epiphorella, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically composed of three sepals and three petals, with one of the petals modified into a lip. Epiphorella species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and gardens.</p>
