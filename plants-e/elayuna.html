                    <h1>Elayuna</h1>
<p>Elayuna, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Elayuna is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable.</p>
