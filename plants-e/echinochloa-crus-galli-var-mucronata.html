                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. mucronata, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a highly invasive annual grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its competitive nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields and is considered a major weed in many parts of the world.</p>
