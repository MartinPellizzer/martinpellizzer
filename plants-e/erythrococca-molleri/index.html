                            <h1>Erythrococca Molleri</h1>
<p>Red cocca, scientifically known as Erythrococca molleri, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Its most notable feature is its vibrant red flowers, which bloom in clusters and create a dramatic visual impact in its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, the plant is relatively rare and often found in rocky, well-drained soils where it thrives in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts. The Red cocca remains a symbol of resilience in some of the most challenging environments on Earth.</p>
