                    <h1>Elyna stricta</h1>
<p>Elyna stricta, commonly known as the rigid elyna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Elyna stricta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes.</p>
