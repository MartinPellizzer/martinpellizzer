                    <h1>Euphorbia tinianensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tinianensis, commonly known as the Tinian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the island of Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in many euphorbias to minimize surface area and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tinianensis is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
