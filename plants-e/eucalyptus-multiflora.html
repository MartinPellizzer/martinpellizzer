<p>Eucalyptus multiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus multiflora is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
