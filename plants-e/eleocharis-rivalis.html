                    <h1>Eleocharis rivalis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis rivalis, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems that produce small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis rivalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
