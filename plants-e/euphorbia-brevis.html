                    <h1>Euphorbia brevis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia brevis, commonly known as the short euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, green stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically short and spiny, providing a protective mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia brevis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
