                    <h1>Echinocactus acutissimus var. cristatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus acutissimus var. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique variant of the hedgehog cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crest-like growth pattern that forms a broad, fan-shaped structure. The plant features spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments.</p>
