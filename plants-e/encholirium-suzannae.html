                    <h1>Encholirium suzannae</h1>
<p>Encholirium suzannae, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, often adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
