                    <h1>Erica furfurosa</h1>
<p>Erica furfurosa, commonly known as the golden heath, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family, Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western Cape region of South Africa, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Erica furfurosa has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall.</p>
