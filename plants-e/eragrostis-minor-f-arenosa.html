<p>Eragrostis minor f. arenosa, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in dry environments.</p>
