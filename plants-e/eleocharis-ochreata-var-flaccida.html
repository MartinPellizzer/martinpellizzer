                    <h1>Eleocharis ochreata var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Eleocharis ochreata var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce minute flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its leaves are often reduced to narrow, grass-like blades. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
