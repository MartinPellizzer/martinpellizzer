<p>Eragrostis chaunantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis chaunantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
