                    <h1>Euphorbia belgheisi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia belgheisi, commonly known as the Belgian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching stem covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
