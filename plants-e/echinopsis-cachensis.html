<p>Echinopsis cachensis, commonly known as the Cachanilla cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xerophytic gardens.</p>
