<p>Eucalyptus flocktoniae subsp.</p>
<p>flocktoniae, commonly known as the Flockton's mallees, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color.</p>
<p>The species produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing ribbed seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and low rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
