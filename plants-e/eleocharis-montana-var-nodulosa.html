<p>Eleocharis montana var. nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its nodular or swollen nodes along the stem, which give it its specific epithet.</p>
