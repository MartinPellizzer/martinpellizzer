                    <h1>Eusteralis griffithii</h1>
<p>Eusteralis griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, snow-white flowers and hairy, silver-green foliage adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant thrives in rocky and arctic conditions, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
