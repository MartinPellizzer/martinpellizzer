                    <h1>Euphorbia phymatosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia phymatosperma, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it may have spiny or waxy coatings for protection.</p>
<p>Euphorbia phymatosperma is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
