                    <h1>Euphorbia triligulata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia triligulata, commonly known as the three-toothed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
