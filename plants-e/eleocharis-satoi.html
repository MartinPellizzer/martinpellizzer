                    <h1>Eleocharis satoi</h1>
<p>Eleocharis satoi, commonly known as the Japanese spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist environments.</p>
<p>Eleocharis satoi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
