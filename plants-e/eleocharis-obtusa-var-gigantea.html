                    <h1>Eleocharis obtusa var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Eleocharis obtusa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water.</p>
