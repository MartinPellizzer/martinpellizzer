                    <h1>Euphorbia subtilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia subtilis, commonly known as the delicate spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
