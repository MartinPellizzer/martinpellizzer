<p>Elaphoglossum eximium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum eximium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
