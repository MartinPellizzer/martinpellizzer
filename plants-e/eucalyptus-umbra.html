                    <h1>Eucalyptus umbra</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus umbra, commonly known as the shadow eucalyptus, is a unique species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its name, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, with a dense canopy that provides shade, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
