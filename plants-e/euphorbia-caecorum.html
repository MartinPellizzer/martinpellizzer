                    <h1>Euphorbia caecorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caecorum, commonly known as the blind euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
