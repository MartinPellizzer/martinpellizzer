                    <h1>Exostema dumosum</h1>
<p>Exostema dumosum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivory.</p>
<p>Exostema dumosum is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
