<p>Epilobium leptophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, erect stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers in the summer months, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Epilobium leptophyllum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
