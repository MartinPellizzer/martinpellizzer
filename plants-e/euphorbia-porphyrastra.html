                    <h1>Euphorbia porphyrastra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia porphyrastra, commonly known as the purple-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia porphyrastra is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
