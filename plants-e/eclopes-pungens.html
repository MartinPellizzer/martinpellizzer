                    <h1>Eclopes pungens</h1>
<p>Eclopes pungens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warm season, which are clustered in a cup-like structure. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its sharp spines, it requires careful handling to avoid injury.</p>
