                    <h1>Euphorbia lophiosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lophiosperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lophiosperma is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky soils and sandy plains.</p>
