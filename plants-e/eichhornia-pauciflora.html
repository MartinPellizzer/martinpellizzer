                    <h1>Eichhornia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Eichhornia pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth rate, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
