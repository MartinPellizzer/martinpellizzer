                    <h1>Efossus wippermannii</h1>
<p>Efossus wippermannii, commonly known as the Wippermann's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, typically between June and August.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Efossus wippermannii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
