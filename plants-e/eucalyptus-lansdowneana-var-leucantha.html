                    <h1>Eucalyptus lansdowneana var. leucantha</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus lansdowneana var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowering ghost gum, is a striking tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a ghostly appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are white or pale pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types, making it a popular choice in landscaping.</p>
