                    <h1>Euphorbia corrigioloides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia corrigioloides, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
