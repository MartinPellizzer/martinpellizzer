                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. submutica</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. submutica, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa but now widespread in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves and distinctive, spiky seed heads that resemble a chicken's comb, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. It has a robust root system and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its invasive potential in many ecosystems.</p>
