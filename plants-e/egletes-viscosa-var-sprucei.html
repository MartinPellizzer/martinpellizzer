<p>Egletes viscosa var. sprucei, commonly known as the sticky egletes, is a variant of the Egletes viscosa species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
