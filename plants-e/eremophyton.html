<p>Eremophyton, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and yellow flowers, which are adapted to thrive in arid environments. The plants typically have a rosette growth form, which helps reduce water loss and protect the stem from extreme temperatures. Eremophyton species are native to regions with harsh, dry climates, such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
