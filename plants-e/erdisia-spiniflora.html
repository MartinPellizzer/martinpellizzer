<p>Erdisia spiniflora, commonly known as the spiny flax or prickly flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Erdisia spiniflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
