<p>Euphorbia rubra f. autumnalis, commonly known as the Autumnal Spurge, is a compact, succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features striking red-pink bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn coloration, which adds visual interest to gardens throughout the fall season.</p>
