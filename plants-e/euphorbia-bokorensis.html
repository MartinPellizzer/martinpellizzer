                    <h1>Euphorbia bokorensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bokorensis, commonly known as the Bokorensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bokorensis is often found growing in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the understory conditions of its native habitat.</p>
