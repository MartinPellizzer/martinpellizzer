                    <h1>Euphorbia stictospora var. texensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stictospora var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Texas.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems covered in spiny, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, with modified structures that aid in water conservation.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
