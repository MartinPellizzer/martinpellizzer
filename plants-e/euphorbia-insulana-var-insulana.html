<p>Euphorbia insulana var. insulana, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its woody structure. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
