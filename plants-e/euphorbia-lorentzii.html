                    <h1>Euphorbia lorentzii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lorentzii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
