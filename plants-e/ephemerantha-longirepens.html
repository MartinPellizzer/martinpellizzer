                    <h1>Ephemerantha longirepens</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha longirepens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, white, orchid-like flower with long, slender petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces a single, showy bloom that typically lasts only a few weeks.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
