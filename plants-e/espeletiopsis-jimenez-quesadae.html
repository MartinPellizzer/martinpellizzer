<p>Espeletiopsis jimenez-quesadae, commonly known as the Quesada's espeletia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against intense sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in cloud forests where humidity and shade are abundant.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in the study of Andean flora and ecological resilience.</p>
