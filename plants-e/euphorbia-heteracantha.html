<p>Euphorbia heteracantha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, woody stems covered in a thick layer of pale green, waxy bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
