<p>Eremogone congesta var. crassula, commonly known as the thickleaf eremogone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
