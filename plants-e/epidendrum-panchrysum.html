                    <h1>Epidendrum panchrysum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum panchrysum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cascade of golden bells. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum panchrysum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
