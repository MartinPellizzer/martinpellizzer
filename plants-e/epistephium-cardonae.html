<p>Epistephium cardonae, commonly known as the cactus of the Canary Islands, is a species of cactus native to the island of Tenerife.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its structure is adapted for minimal water loss, with a waxy coating on its surface.</p>
<p>Epistephium cardonae plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert organisms.</p>
