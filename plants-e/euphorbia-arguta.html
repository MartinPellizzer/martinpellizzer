<p>Euphorbia arguta, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia arguta is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
