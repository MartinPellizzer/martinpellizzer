<p>Eriospermum flexuosum, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Eriospermum flexuosum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
