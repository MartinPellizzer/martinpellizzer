                    <h1>Euphorbia damarana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia damarana, commonly known as the Damaran spurge, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia damarana is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
