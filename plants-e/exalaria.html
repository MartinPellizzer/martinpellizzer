                    <h1>Exalaria</h1>
<p>Exalaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks a visible stem and has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which provide essential nutrients for its growth. Exalaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the canopy of cypress swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
