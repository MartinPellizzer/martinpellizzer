                    <h1>Euphorbia matritensis var. ramosissima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia matritensis var. ramosissima, commonly known as the Madrid spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight.</p>
