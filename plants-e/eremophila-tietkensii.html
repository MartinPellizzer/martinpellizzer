<p>Eremophila tietkensii, commonly known as the Tietkens' erymophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in sandplains and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Eremophila tietkensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
