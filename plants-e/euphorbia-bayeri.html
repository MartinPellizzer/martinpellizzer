                    <h1>Euphorbia bayeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bayeri, commonly known as the bayery's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bayeri is popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
