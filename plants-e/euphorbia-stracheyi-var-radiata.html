                    <h1>Euphorbia stracheyi var. radiata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stracheyi var. radiata, commonly known as the radiate euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves arranged in a radial pattern. The plant produces striking yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
