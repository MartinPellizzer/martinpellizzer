                    <h1>Eragrostis frankii var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Eragrostis frankii var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in dry landscapes and gardens.</p>
