<p>Eragrostis lugens f. pallida, commonly known as the pale wheatgrass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
