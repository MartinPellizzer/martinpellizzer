                    <h1>Eurya japonica var. pumila</h1>
<p>Eurya japonica var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese eurya, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its dense, rounded growth habit.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, attractive shrub.</p>
