                    <h1>Epidendrum littorale</h1>
<p>Epidendrum littorale, commonly known as the coastal epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Epidendrum littorale is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
