                    <h1>Epidendrum pastoris</h1>
<p>Epidendrum pastoris, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Epidendrum pastoris is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
