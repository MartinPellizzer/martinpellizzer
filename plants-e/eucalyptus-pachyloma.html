<p>Eucalyptus pachyloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and varies in color from grey to white, often peeling in thin strips.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus pachyloma is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
