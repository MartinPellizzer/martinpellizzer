                    <h1>Euonymus latifolius var. eximius</h1>
<p>Euonymus latifolius var. eximius, commonly known as the glossy euonymus, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy sheen that becomes more pronounced in the shade. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 that split open to reveal bright red seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions, making it a concern for ecological balance.</p>
