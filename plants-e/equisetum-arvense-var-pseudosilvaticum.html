                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. pseudosilvaticum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. pseudosilvaticum, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, known for its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of horsetails. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
