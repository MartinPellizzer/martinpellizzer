                    <h1>Edritria</h1>
<p>Edritria, commonly known as the bluebell of the desert, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Edritria blooms in spring, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
