                    <h1>Eucalyptus pilligaensis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus pilligaensis, commonly known as the Pilliga eucalypt, is a tall, slender tree native to the Pilliga Forest in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically cream to pale yellow in color. Its timber is valued for its durability and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and land clearing, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
