                    <h1>Ebermaiera merguensis</h1>
<p>Ebermaiera merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensian fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid tropical forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are bi-lobed and feature a unique pattern of veins, which aid in water retention in its moist, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ebermaiera merguensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
