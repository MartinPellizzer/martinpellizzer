                    <h1>Elytrigia reflexiaristata</h1>
<p>Elytrigia reflexiaristata, commonly known as the reflexed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
