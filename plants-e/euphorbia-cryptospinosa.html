                    <h1>Euphorbia cryptospinosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cryptospinosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in small, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped inflorescences containing small yellow flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
