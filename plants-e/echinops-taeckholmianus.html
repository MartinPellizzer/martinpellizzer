<p>Echinops taeckholmianus, commonly known as the Taeckholm's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small, white balls, which appear in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads.</p>
<p>Echinops taeckholmianus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
