<p>Epipactis albensis subsp.</p>
<p>moravica, commonly known as the Moravian white helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows, often growing on decaying wood or in rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
