                    <h1>Epipactis × pupplingensis</h1>
<p>Epipactis × pupplingensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species that results from the cross between Epipactis helleborine and Epipactis palustris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spirally arranged floral spikes that produce small, fragrant, white to pale green flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its hybrid nature makes it a unique subject in botanical studies, often found in regions where its parent species overlap.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
