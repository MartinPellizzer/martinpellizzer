                    <h1>Espeletia schultzii var. subparamuna</h1>
<p>Espeletia schultzii var. subparamuna, commonly known as the Paramo espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the paramo ecosystem.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
