                    <h1>Epipactis palustris f. longibracteata</h1>
<p>Epipactis palustris f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract marsh helleborine, is a variant of the marsh helleborine, a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower spike, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
