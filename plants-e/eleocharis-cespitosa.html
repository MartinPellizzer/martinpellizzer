                    <h1>Eleocharis cespitosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis cespitosa, commonly known as spikegrass, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis cespitosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity.</p>
