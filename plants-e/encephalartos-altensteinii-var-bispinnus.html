                    <h1>Encephalartos altensteinii var. bispinnus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos altensteinii var. bispinnus, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of dense, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, ovoid female cones that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
