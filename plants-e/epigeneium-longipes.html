<p>Epigeneium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epigeneium, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by berries that range in color from red to yellow.
