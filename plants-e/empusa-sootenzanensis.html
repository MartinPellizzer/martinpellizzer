<p>Empusa sootenzanensis, commonly known as the Sootenzenan Ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of Sootenzena.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that emit a subtle, sweet aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the humid air rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited habitat, Empusa sootenzanensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
