                    <h1>Enchylaena pubescens</h1>
<p>Enchylaena pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and intricate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include a short, thick rhizome and specialized roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
