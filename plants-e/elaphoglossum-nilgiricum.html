                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nilgiricum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nilgiricum, commonly known as the Nilgiri holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native region.</p>
