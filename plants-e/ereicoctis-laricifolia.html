                    <h1>Ereicoctis laricifolia</h1>
<p>Ereicoctis laricifolia, commonly known as the white spruce gall wasp, is a parasitic wasp species that feeds on the foliage of white spruce trees.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and is known for inducing the formation of galls on the leaves of its host plant. The galls are abnormal growths that provide shelter and nutrients for the developing wasp larvae. The plant's leaves are typically needle-like, characteristic of coniferous trees, and are often clustered in whorls.</p>
<p>This interaction between the wasp and the plant highlights the complex relationships in forest ecosystems.</p>
