                    <h1>Erucastrum gravinae</h1>
<p>Erucastrum gravinae, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in coastal areas and estuaries where it can tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its reproductive system involves both self-fertilization and cross-pollination, enhancing its survival in challenging habitats.</p>
<p>Erucastrum gravinae plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
