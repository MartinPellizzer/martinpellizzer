<p>Euphorbia peplus, commonly known as petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, simple leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Euphorbia peplus thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a persistent and widespread species.</p>
