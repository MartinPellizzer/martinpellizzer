<p>Erica acuta var. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and narrow. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
