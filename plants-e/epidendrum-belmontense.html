<p>Epidendrum belmontense, commonly known as the Belmont's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat.</p>
