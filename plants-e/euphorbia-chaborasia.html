                    <h1>Euphorbia chaborasia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chaborasia, commonly known as the Chaborasi spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with smooth, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chaborasia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
