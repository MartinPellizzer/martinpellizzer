                            <h1>Erica Purpurascens</h1>
<p>Erica purpurascens, commonly known as the purple heath, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. Its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant purple flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and resilience. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. With its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions, it has become a symbol of hardiness in horticultural circles. Its unique appearance and ecological value have earned it a place in both wild and cultivated environments.</p>
