                    <h1>Eleutherospermum chrysanthum</h1>
<p>Eleutherospermum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, star-shaped structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
