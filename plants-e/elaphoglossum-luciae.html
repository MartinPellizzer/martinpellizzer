                    <h1>Elaphoglossum luciae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum luciae, commonly known as the Lucy's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. This fern is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum luciae is often found in dense rainforests, where it plays a role in the ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
