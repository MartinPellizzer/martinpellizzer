                    <h1>Euphorbia colletioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia colletioides, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem covered in dense, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia colletioides is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
