                    <h1>Erythroxylum microphyllum f. reticulatum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum microphyllum f. reticulatum, commonly known as the red-veined or reticulated coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive red or purple vein pattern that contrasts with the green foliage. The plant belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as cocaine. Its leaves are often used in traditional practices and have been subject to both cultural and legal scrutiny.</p>
<p>The reticulate leaf venation is a key botanical feature that distinguishes this form from other coca species.</p>
