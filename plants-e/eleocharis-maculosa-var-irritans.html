<p>Eleocharis maculosa var. irritans, commonly known as the spiked spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
