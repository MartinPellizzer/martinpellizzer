<p>Eleocharis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that consists of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread vegetatively, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Eleocharis cylindrica plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
