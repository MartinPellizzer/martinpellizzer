                    <h1>Euphorbia esula var. elata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia esula var. elata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, blue-green leaves and its distinctive yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is considered an invasive species in North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
