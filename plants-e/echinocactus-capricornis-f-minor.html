                    <h1>Echinocactus capricornis f. minor</h1>
<p>Echinocactus capricornis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature horse cactus, is a rare and compact variant of the horse cactus.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of the Cactaceae family, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
