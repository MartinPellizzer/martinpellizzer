<p>Epilobium glandulosum, commonly known as sticky willow or glandular willow, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a sticky texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside, and it produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Epilobium glandulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
