<p>Elaphoglossum scalpellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum scalpellum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
