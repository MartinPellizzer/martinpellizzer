<p>Ectadium virgatum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and can be submerged or floating, depending on the water conditions.</p>
<p>Ectadium virgatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food chain through its prey-capturing mechanism.</p>
