                    <h1>Elytranthe balansae</h1>
<p>Elytranthe balansae, commonly known as the Balansae elytranthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many tropical plants known for their vibrant flowers and water-storing leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are small and clustered, are usually a striking red or orange color, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
