<p>Elatine serpillifolium, commonly known as the mossy waterwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Elatinaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. Its small, opposite leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Elatine serpillifolium is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive periods of desiccation by entering a dormant state.</p>
