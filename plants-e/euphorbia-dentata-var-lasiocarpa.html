                    <h1>Euphorbia dentata var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dentata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to small, toothed scales, and it is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique appearance and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
