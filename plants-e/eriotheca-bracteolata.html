<p>Eriotheca bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often concealed by bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Eriotheca bracteolata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
