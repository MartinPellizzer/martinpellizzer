                    <h1>Euphorbia alpina var. rupicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia alpina var. rupicola, commonly known as the Alpine spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, showing adaptations to cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in cooler climates.</p>
