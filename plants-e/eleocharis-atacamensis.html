<p>Eleocharis atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, where it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in saline or alkaline soils and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
