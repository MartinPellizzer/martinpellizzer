<p>Echinopsis antezanae, commonly known as the Antezana's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of white spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts.</p>
