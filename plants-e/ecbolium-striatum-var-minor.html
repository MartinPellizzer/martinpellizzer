                    <h1>Ecbolium striatum var. minor</h1>
<p>Ecbolium striatum var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ecbolium, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive striated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
