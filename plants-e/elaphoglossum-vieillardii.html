<p>Elaphoglossum vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum vieillardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
