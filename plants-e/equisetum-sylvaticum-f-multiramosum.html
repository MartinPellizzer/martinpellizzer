                    <h1>Equisetum sylvaticum f. multiramosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum sylvaticum f. multiramosum, commonly known as the bristly field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinct, segmented stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
