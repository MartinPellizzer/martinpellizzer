<p>Euphorbia uniglans, commonly known as the single-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, thick, fleshy leaf that emerges from a short, woody stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia uniglans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
