                    <h1>Eugenia robusta</h1>
<p>Eugenia robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaved eucalypt, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is often found in open forests and woodlands, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eugenia robusta is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>
