<p>Epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a pale, often white or pinkish appearance. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale green.</p>
<p>Epipogium is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in leaf litter.</p>
