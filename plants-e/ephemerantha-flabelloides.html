                    <h1>Ephemerantha flabelloides</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha flabelloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air and rain for sustenance. Its leaves are long and narrow, and it lacks true roots, which makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ephemerantha flabelloides is considered an endangered species.</p>
