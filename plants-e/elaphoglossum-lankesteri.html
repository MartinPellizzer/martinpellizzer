                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lankesteri</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
