                    <h1>Euphorbia eremophila var. oblonga</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eremophila var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to skin, a common characteristic among members of its genus.</p>
