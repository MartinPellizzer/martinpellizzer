                    <h1>Euphorbia scabrella</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scabrella, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia scabrella is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
