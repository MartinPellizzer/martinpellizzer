<p>Eragrostis leptocalymma, commonly known as slenderawn grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
