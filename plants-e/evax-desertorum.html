                    <h1>Evax desertorum</h1>
<p>Evax desertorum, commonly known as the desert saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or white flowers, typically in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Evax desertorum is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
