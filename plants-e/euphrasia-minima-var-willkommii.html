<p>Euphrasia minima var. willkommii, commonly known as the small yellow gentian, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with dark markings. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which can aid in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
