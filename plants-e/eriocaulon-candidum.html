<p>Eriocaulon candidum, commonly known as the white threadgrass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon candidum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
