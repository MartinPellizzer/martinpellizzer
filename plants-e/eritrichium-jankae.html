<p>Eritrichium jankae, commonly known as the Janka's alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Eritrichium jankae has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
