                    <h1>Echeveria bryceae</h1>
<p>Echeveria bryceae, commonly known as the Bryce Canyon echeveria, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a powdery coating that gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of violet to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic diversity.</p>
