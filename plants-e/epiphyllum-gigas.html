<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically pink or red, opening at night and closing by morning. Its leaves are usually present when young but are shed as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Epiphyllum gigas thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
