<p>Euphorbia spinosa subsp.</p>
<p>spinosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, contributing to its overall spiny appearance.</p>
<p>It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for dry climates.</p>
