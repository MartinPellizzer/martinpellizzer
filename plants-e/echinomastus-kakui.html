<p>Echinomastus kakui, commonly known as the Kakui cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Echinomastus kakui is often found in coastal areas and is considered an endemic species to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
