<p>Eragrostis barrelieri subvar. pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it ideal for erosion control and ornamental use in dry landscapes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The grass is also valued for its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
