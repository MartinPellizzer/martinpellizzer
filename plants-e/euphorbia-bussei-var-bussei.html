                    <h1>Euphorbia bussei var. bussei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bussei var. bussei, commonly known as the Bussei Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
