                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus obvallatus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus obvallatus, commonly known as the "Tulip Cactus," is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stems. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
