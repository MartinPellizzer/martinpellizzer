                    <h1>Euphorbia ammatotricha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ammatotricha, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ammatotricha is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
