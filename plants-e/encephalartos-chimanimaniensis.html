<p>Encephalartos chimanimaniensis, commonly known as the Chimanimani cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
