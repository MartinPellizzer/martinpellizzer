<p>Elytrigia pungens subsp.</p>
<p>fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on well-drained soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tightly pressed against the ground, a characteristic feature of many bentgrasses. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that makes it visually distinct.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
