                    <h1>Eschweilera confusa</h1>
<p>Eschweilera confusa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Eschweilera confusa is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
