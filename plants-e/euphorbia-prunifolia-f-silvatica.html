                    <h1>Euphorbia prunifolia f. silvatica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia prunifolia f. silvatica, commonly known as the forest euphorbia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish tinge, and are arranged oppositely along the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun.</p>
