<p>Echinospermum texanum, commonly known as Texas thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are typically covered in bristles. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its thistle-like appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species in the Asteraceae family.</p>
