                    <h1>Echeveria pumila</h1>
<p>Echeveria pumila, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a small, compact succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
