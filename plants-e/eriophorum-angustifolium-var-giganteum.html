                    <h1>Eriophorum angustifolium var. giganteum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum angustifolium var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant tussock sedge, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering spikes that rise from a mat of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, often forming extensive tussocks that stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its flowering structures, which are typically pink to reddish in color, are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>The species is an important component of peatland ecosystems, contributing to the formation of peat through the accumulation of its dead plant material.</p>
