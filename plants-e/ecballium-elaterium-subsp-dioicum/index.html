                            <h1>Ecballium Elaterium Subsp. Dioicum</h1>
<p>Ecballium elaterium subsp. dioicum is a lesser-known variant of the common cowbane plant. It is characterized by its unique dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in southern Europe. Its seeds are encased in a tough, spiky fruit that can cause irritation if touched. Despite its unappealing appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical study.</p>
