                    <h1>Epidendrum howardii</h1>
<p>Epidendrum howardii, commonly known as the Howard's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum howardii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
