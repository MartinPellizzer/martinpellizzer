                    <h1>Eurycles sylvestris</h1>
<p>Eurycles sylvestris, commonly known as the forest euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in a dense layer of yellowish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, often with a central orange or red disc. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This species is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
