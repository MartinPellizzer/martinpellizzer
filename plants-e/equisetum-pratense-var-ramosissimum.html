                    <h1>Equisetum pratense var. ramosissimum</h1>
<p>Equisetum pratense var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the bristly field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and a distinct, segmented stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
