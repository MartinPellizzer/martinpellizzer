<p>Eriosorus glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Eriosorus glaziovii is native to Mexico and is often found in humid, tropical regions.</p>
