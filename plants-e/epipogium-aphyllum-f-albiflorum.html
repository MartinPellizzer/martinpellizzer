                    <h1>Epipogium aphyllum f. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Epipogium aphyllum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a single, showy white flower that is often mistaken for a ghostly apparition due to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
