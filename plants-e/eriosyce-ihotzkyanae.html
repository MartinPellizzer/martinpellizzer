<p>Eriosyce ihotzkyanae, commonly known as the Ihotzko giant cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
