                    <h1>Eria dendrophylax</h1>
<p>Eria dendrophylax, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Eria dendrophylax thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
