<p>Elaphoglossum bryogenes, commonly known as the moss fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that give it a moss-like appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Elaphoglossum bryogenes has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
