                    <h1>Escobariopsis gracilis</h1>
<p>Escobariopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender escobariopsis, is a small, delicate lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically crustose and grows on bark or soil in temperate regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is relatively uncommon in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
