                    <h1>Eragrostis decipiens</h1>
<p>Eragrostis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for other grasses due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its surroundings.</p>
<p>Eragrostis decipiens is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological adaptability.</p>
