                    <h1>Euphorbia chimaera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chimaera, commonly known as the "Crimson Thorn" or "Fire Thorn," is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, and small greenish-yellow true flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
