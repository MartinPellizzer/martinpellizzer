<p>Eucalyptus resinifera var. pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pink or pale blue, which appear in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance.</p>
