<p>Exochaenium chionanthum, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Exochaenium chionanthum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky areas.</p>
