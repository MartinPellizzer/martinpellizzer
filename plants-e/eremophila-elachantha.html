<p>Eremophila elachantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Eremophila elachantha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
