<p>Elaphoglossum pallidum, commonly known as the pale elaphoglossum, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Elaphoglossum pallidum is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species for studies in fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
