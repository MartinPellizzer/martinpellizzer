                    <h1>Eschenbachia muliensis</h1>
<p>Eschenbachia muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis Ghost Fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are released in late spring and early summer, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eschenbachia muliensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
