                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. granulatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. granulatum, commonly known as the rough field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its distinctive, scaly, and rough-textured stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family, and it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant features whorled leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the main stem bearing a series of nodes and spore-producing cones. Its stems are hollow and jointed, a feature typical of horsetails, and they can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
