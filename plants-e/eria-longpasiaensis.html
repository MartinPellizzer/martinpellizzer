                    <h1>Eria longpasiaensis</h1>
<p>Eria longpasiaensis, commonly known as the Longpasia orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eria longpasiaensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
