<p>Elaphoglossum catenatum, commonly known as the chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum catenatum is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
