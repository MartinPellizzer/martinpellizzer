<p>Elaphoglossum ovatum, commonly known as the ovate harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
