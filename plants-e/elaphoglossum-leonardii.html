                    <h1>Elaphoglossum leonardii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Elaphoglossum leonardii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
