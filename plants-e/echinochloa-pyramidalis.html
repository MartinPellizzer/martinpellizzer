                    <h1>Echinochloa pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Echinochloa pyramidalis, commonly known as rough false brome, is an annual grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spike-like inflorescence and hairy leaves, which help distinguish it from similar species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Echinochloa pyramidalis is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
