<p>Epithelantha pachyrhiza subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the elongated barrel cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
