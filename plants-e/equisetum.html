                    <h1>Equisetum</h1>
<p>Equisetum, commonly known as horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Horsetails are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their stems can grow rapidly, sometimes reaching several meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant contains high levels of silica, which gives it a distinctive abrasive texture and has historically been used in various practical applications.</p>
