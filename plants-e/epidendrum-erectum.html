<p>Epidendrum erectum, commonly known as the upright epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Epidendrum erectum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, well-drained environments.</p>
