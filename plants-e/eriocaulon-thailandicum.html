                    <h1>Eriocaulon thailandicum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon thailandicum, commonly known as the Thai marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon thailandicum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
