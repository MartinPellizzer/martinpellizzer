                    <h1>Euphorbia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and branched stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
