                    <h1>Epidendrum viviparum f. maior</h1>
<p>Epidendrum viviparum f. maior, commonly known as the giant viviparous epidendrum, is a striking orchid species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. One of its most notable botanical features is its viviparous nature, where plantlets develop on the flower stems and can detach to grow independently.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
