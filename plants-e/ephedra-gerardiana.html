                    <h1>Ephedra gerardiana</h1>
<p>Ephedra gerardiana, commonly known as the desert tea or St. John's wort of the desert, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and red-brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ephedra gerardiana is adapted to survive in extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties.</p>
