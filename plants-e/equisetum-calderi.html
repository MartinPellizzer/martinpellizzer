                    <h1>Equisetum calderi</h1>
<p>Equisetum calderi, commonly known as the Caldeira horsetail, is a fossilized plant that provides insights into ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes modern horsetails, and is characterized by its jointed stems and whorled leaves. This plant thrived during the Carboniferous period, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its structure suggests it was a primitive vascular plant with a simple yet efficient system for water transport.</p>
<p>Fossil records of Equisetum calderi help scientists understand the evolution of early terrestrial plant life.</p>
