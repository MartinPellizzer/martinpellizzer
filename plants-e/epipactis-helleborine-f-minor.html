<p>Epipactis helleborine f. minor, commonly known as the lesser helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare in some areas and is protected in others due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
