                    <h1>Euphorbia socialis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia socialis, commonly known as the Crowfoot Spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it should be handled with care.</p>
