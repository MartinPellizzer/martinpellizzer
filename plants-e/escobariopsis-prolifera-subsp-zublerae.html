<p>Escobariopsis prolifera subsp.</p>
<p>zublerae, commonly known as the Zuber's cushion moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant features small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying liverwort diversity and adaptation.</p>
