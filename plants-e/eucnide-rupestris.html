                    <h1>Eucnide rupestris</h1>
<p>Eucnide rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Eucnide rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
