                    <h1>Eleocharis capitata var. verrucosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis capitata var. verrucosa, commonly known as the verrucous spike-rush, is a sedge species characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The varietal form *verrucosa* is distinguished by its rough, warty surface on the stems and leaves.</p>
