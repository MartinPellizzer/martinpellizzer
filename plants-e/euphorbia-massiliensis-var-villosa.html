                    <h1>Euphorbia massiliensis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia massiliensis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Massiliensis spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, short stem that stores water, and it has fleshy, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to xeriscaping efforts.</p>
