                    <h1>Euphorbia indica var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia indica var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
