<p>Eschweilera labriculata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically white or pale yellow, while its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
