<p>Eriosorus areniticola, commonly known as the sandstone spleenworts, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic liverwort, meaning it grows on rocks, particularly sandstone, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stalk and leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. Its spore-producing capsules are typically borne on short stalks at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Eriosorus areniticola is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where the substrate is rocky and the climate is moist.</p>
