<p>Eremobium aegyptiacum, commonly known as the Egyptian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant has adapted to harsh environments by developing a fibrous root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Eremobium aegyptiacum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is characteristic of desert and semi-arid habitats.</p>
