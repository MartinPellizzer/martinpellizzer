                    <h1>Euphorbia vauthieriana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vauthieriana, commonly known as the Vauthier's spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, giving it a unique visual appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
