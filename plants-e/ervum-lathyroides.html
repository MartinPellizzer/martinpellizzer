<p>Ervum lathyroides, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
