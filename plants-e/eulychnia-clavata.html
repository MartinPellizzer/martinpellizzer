                <h1>Eulychnia clavata</h1>
<p>Eulychnia clavata, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Eulychnia clavata is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
