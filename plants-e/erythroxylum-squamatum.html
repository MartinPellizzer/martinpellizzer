<p>Erythroxylum squamatum, commonly known as the silverleaf coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing elliptical, brown seeds. It is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in some indigenous cultures.</p>
