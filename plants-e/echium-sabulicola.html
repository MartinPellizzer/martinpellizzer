                    <h1>Echium sabulicola</h1>
<p>Echium sabulicola, commonly known as the sand evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination strategy and habitat preferences, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems.</p>
