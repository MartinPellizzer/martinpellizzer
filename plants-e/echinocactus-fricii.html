<p>Echinocactus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adapted to store water in its succulent tissues. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its spiny exterior provides protection against herbivores and excessive moisture loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus fricii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant for desert environments.</p>
