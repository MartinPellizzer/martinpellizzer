                    <h1>Echeveria × semiteres</h1>
<p>Echeveria × semiteres, commonly known as the "Pineapple Echeveria," is a hybrid succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray to green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces compact, pineapple-like inflorescences with showy pink or red flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
