                    <h1>Elytrigia antarctica</h1>
<p>Elytrigia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Elytrigia antarctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments.</p>
