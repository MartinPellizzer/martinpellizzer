<p>Elaphoglossum resinosum, commonly known as the resinous holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, resinous coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum resinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
