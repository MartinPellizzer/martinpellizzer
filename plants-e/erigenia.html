<p>Erigenia, commonly known as the "sedge grass" or "blue-eyed grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Erigenia species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a striking blue or purple hue. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to their ecological significance, some species are considered indicators of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
