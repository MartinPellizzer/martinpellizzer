                    <h1>Erythraea maritima var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Erythraea maritima var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are specialized to tolerate saline soils, making it a unique example of halophytic vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
