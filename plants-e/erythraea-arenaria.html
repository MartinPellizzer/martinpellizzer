                    <h1>Erythraea arenaria</h1>
<p>Erythraea arenaria, commonly known as the sand erythranthe, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erythraea arenaria is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
