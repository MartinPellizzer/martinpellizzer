<p>Epipactis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces a tall, erect stem bearing a single spike of greenish-yellow flowers, which are notable for their intricate structure and lack of a typical orchid labellum. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Epipactis viridiflora is an important species for pollinators and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
