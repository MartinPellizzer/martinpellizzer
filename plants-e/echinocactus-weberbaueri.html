                    <h1>Echinocactus weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Echinocactus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens and collections.</p>
