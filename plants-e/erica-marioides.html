                    <h1>Erica marioides</h1>
<p>Erica marioides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Erica marioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
