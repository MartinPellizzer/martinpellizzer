                    <h1>Eriochloa distachya</h1>
<p>Eriochloa distachya, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-branched inflorescences that are often mistaken for true bromes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eriochloa distachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
