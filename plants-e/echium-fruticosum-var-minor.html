                    <h1>Echium fruticosum var. minor</h1>
<p>Echium fruticosum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
