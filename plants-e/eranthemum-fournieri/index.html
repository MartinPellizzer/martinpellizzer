                            <h1>Eranthemum Fournieri</h1>
<p>Fournier's eranthemum, scientifically known as Eranthemum fournieri, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This species is characterized by its strikingly colorful leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it has gained attention among horticulturists and conservationists. However, its habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and climate change.</p>
