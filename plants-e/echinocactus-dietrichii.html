                    <h1>Echinocactus dietrichii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus dietrichii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that is covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
