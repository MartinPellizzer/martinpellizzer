The plant has succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Euphorbia abbottii is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
