                    <h1>Epidendrum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum microcarpum, commonly known as the miniature seedpod orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a slight greenish tinge. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Epidendrum microcarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
