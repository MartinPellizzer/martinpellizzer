                    <h1>Euphorbia umbonata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia umbonata, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a swollen base that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster known as a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Euphorbia umbonata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
