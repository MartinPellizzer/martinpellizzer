                    <h1>Ekebergia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Ekebergia sclerophylla, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making.</p>
