                    <h1>Eriocaulon radicans</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon radicans, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, which emerge from the water or wet soil. Eriocaulon radicans is often found in marshy areas, shallow lakes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
