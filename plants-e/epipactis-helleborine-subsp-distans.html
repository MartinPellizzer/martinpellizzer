<p>Epipactis helleborine subsp.</p>
<p>distans, commonly known as the distant helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
