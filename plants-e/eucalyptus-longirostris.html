                    <h1>Eucalyptus longirostris</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus longirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus longirostris is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
