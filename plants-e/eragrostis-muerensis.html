                    <h1>Eragrostis muerensis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis muerensis, commonly known as muer's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally used in landscaping and erosion control in dry environments.</p>
