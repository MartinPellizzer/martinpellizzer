                    <h1>Echinocactus equitans</h1>
<p>Echinocactus equitans, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that is often covered in prominent, rib-like structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
