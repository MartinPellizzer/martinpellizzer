<p>Encyclia trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
