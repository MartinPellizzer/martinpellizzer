<p>Epidendrum striatum, commonly known as the streaked orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems growing horizontally and producing new shoots from the base. The plant produces showy, lance-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and red, with a distinctive striped pattern on the petals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum striatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
