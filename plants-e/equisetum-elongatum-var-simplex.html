                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. simplex</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This species is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and is often associated with wetlands or streambanks. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its stems produce fertile strobila at the tips.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, offering insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
