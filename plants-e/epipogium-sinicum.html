                    <h1>Epipogium sinicum</h1>
<p>Epipogium sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and intriguing member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a unique, small, fleshy root system that forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
