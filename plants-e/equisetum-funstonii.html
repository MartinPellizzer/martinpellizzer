                    <h1>Equisetum funstonii</h1>
<p>Equisetum funstonii, commonly known as the Funston's horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and the presence of jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile branches that produce spores. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Equisetum funstonii is a relic from the Paleozoic era and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and limited distribution.</p>
