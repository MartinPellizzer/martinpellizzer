<p>Eleocharis gracillima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
