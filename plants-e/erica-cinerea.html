                    <h1>Erica cinerea</h1>
<p>Erica cinerea, commonly known as heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats.</p>
<p>Erica cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
