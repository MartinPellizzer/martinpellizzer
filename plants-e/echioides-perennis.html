                    <h1>Echioides perennis</h1>
<p>Echioides perennis, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming throughout the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the genus Echioides, which includes similar species with similar floral structures.</p>
