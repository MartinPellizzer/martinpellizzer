<p>Epidendrum lineatum, commonly known as the Straight-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking racemes of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lineatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
