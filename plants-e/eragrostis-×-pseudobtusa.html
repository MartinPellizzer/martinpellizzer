                    <h1>Eragrostis × pseudobtusa</h1>
<p>Eragrostis × pseudobtusa, commonly known as the inland speargrass, is a hybrid grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of grassland and shrubland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
