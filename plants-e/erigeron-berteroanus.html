<p>Erigeron berteroanus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
