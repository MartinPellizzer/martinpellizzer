                    <h1>Euphorbia splendens var. splendens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia splendens var. splendens, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often red or purple in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, lantern-like seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
