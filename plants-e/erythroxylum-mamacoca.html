<p>Erythroxylum mamacoca, commonly known as the Amazonian coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine, in its leaves.</p>
