                    <h1>Echeveria viscida var. insularis</h1>
<p>Echeveria viscida var. insularis, commonly known as the Insular Echeveria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with vibrant purple to pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
