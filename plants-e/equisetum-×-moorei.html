<p>Equisetum × moorei, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale, characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential.</p>
