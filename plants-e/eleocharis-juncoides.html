                    <h1>Eleocharis juncoides</h1>
<p>Eleocharis juncoides, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eleocharis juncoides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
