                    <h1>Eleocharis lankana</h1>
<p>Eleocharis lankana, commonly known as the Lankan spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy habitats in southern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Eleocharis lankana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
