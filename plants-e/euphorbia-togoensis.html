                    <h1>Euphorbia togoensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia togoensis, commonly known as the Togo spurge, is a succulent shrub native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia togoensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
