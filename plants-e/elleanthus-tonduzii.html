                    <h1>Elleanthus tonduzii</h1>
<p>Elleanthus tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the grasslands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Elleanthus tonduzii is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
