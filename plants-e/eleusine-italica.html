<p>Eleusine italica, commonly known as Italian lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control.</p>
