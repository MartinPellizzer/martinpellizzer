                    <h1>Euphorbia dumosoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dumosoides, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
