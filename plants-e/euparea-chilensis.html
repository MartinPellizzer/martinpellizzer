<p>Euparea chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean euparea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Chile, where it grows in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Euparea chilensis is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in environments with limited moisture.</p>
