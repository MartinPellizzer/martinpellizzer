<p>Elymus lazicus subsp.</p>
<p>iranicus, commonly known as the Iranian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia, particularly Iran and parts of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fine leaves, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
