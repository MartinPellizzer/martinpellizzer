                    <h1>Euphorbia polygona var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polygona var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branched stem covered in small, green, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
