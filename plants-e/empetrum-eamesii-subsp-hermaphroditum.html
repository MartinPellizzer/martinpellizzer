<p>Empetrum eamesii subsp.</p>
<p>hermaphroditum, commonly known as the Hawaiian rockflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is notable for being a dioecious species, though the subspecies hermaphroditum exhibits hermaphroditism, meaning individual plants have both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution.</p>
