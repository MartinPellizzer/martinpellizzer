                    <h1>Euphorbia robusta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia robusta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
<p>Euphorbia robusta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
