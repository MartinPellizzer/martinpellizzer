<p>Elaphoglossum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly hartsmitt, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
