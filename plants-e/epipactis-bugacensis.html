<p>Epipactis bugacensis, commonly known as the Bugac orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and striking, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its reproductive strategy involves a specialized relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is crucial for its seed germination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species.</p>
