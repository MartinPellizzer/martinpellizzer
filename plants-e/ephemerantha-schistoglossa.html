                    <h1>Ephemerantha schistoglossa</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha schistoglossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
