                    <h1>Ebenus cauliflora</h1>
<p>Ebenus cauliflora, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters near the base of the stems, a feature known as cauliflory. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption from shallow soil layers.</p>
<p>Ebenus cauliflora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
