                    <h1>Euphorbia pallasiana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pallasiana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
