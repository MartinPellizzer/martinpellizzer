                    <h1>Eragrostis xerophila</h1>
<p>Eragrostis xerophila, commonly known as the desert lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant is well-adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Eragrostis xerophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
