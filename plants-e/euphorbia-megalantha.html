                    <h1>Euphorbia megalantha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia megalantha, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
