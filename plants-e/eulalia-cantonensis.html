<p>Eulalia cantonensis, commonly known as the Canton grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
