<p>Erigeron breunius, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its blue to purple ray flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Erigeron breunius is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
