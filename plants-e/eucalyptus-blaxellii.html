                    <h1>Eucalyptus blaxellii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus blaxellii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus blaxellii is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>
