<p>Euphorbia muricata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in sharp, spine-like structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia muricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
