<p>Equisetum arvense subsp.</p>
<p>boreale, commonly known as northern field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of spore-bearing branches and a distinct, hollow, jointed stem.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
