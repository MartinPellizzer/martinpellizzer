                    <h1>Eriobotrya japonica f. variegata</h1>
<p>Eriobotrya japonica f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated loquat, is a decorative variant of the loquat tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to China. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits similar to those of the standard loquat, though they are typically smaller and less abundant.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit yield.</p>
