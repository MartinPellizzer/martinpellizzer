<p>Eriospora abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Eriospora abyssinica plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
