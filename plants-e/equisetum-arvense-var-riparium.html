<p>Equisetum arvense var. riparium, commonly known as water horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near water bodies. It thrives in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic environments such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
