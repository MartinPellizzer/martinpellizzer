                    <h1>Euphorbia levis var. imbricata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia levis var. imbricata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with dense, overlapping leaves that give it a distinctive, almost moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by bright red bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as a decorative succulent in dry climates.</p>
