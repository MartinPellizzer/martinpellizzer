<p>Eremophila battii var. battii, commonly known as the red-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
