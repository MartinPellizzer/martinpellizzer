                    <h1>Euphorbia valentina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia valentina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience to drought.</p>
