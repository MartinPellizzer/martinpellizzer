                    <h1>Eriogonum marifolium var. cupulatum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum marifolium var. cupulatum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic habitats.</p>
