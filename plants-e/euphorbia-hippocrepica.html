<p>Euphorbia hippocrepica, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
