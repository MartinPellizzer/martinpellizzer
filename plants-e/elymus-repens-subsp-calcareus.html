<p>Elymus repens subsp.</p>
<p>calcareus, commonly known as the calcareous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets arranged in two rows, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
