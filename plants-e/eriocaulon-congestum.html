<p>Eriocaulon congestum, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by specialized bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon congestum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
