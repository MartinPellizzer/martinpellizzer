<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>komoricensis, commonly known as the Komoren orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Comoros archipelago. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, featuring dark green, lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
