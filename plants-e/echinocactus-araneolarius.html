                    <h1>Echinocactus araneolarius</h1>
<p>Echinocactus araneolarius, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which serve as protective structures against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
