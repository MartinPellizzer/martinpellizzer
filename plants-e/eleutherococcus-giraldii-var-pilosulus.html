                    <h1>Eleutherococcus giraldii var. pilosulus</h1>
<p>Eleutherococcus giraldii var. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy eleuthero, is a rare variant of the eleuthero plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces red berries that ripen in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species.</p>
