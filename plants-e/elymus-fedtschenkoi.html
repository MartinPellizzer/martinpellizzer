<p>Elymus fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has slender, wiry stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-rowed spikelets.</p>
<p>Elymus fedtschenkoi is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
