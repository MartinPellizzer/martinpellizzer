                    <h1>Eriogonum repens</h1>
<p>Eriogonum repens, commonly known as the creeping bushmallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground in dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriogonum repens is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and foothills.</p>
