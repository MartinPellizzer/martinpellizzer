<p>Elatine paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the greater water starwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or floating. Its small, star-shaped flowers are white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, linear, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments.</p>
