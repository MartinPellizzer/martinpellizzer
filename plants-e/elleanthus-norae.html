                    <h1>Elleanthus norae</h1>
<p>Elleanthus norae, commonly known as the rare mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Elleanthus norae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
