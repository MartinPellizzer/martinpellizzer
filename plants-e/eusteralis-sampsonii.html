                    <h1>Eusteralis sampsonii</h1>
<p>Eusteralis sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Eusteralis sampsonii plays a unique role in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
