                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus f. bruennowianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus f. bruennowianus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered with sharp, spiny tubercles, giving it a distinct hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>This fasciation variant is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in dry climates.</p>
