                    <h1>Epidendrum trilobochilum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum trilobochilum, commonly known as the three-lobed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Epidendrum trilobochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
