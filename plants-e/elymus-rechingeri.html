<p>Elymus rechingeri, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize soil in rocky and arid habitats.</p>
<p>Elymus rechingeri is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife in its native range.</p>
