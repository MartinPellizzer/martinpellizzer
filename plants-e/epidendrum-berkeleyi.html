                    <h1>Epidendrum berkeleyi</h1>
<p>Epidendrum berkeleyi, commonly known as the Berkeley's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum berkeleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation.</p>
