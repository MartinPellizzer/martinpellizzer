<p>Equisetum arvense f. proliferum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
