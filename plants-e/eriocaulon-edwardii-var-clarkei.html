                    <h1>Eriocaulon edwardii var. clarkei</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon edwardii var. clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's spike-rush, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
