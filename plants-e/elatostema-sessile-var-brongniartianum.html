<p>Elatostema sessile var. brongniartianum, commonly known as the small-leaf elatostema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are borne in dense clusters at the base of the stems.</p>
