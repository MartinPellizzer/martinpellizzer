                    <h1>Euphorbia quinquecostata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia quinquecostata, commonly known as the five-costate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may be spiny, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia quinquecostata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
