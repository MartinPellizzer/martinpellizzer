                    <h1>Effusiella nonresupinata</h1>
<p>Effusiella nonresupinata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and colonize sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Effusiella nonresupinata is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
