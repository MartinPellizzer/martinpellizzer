                    <h1>Echinochlaenia</h1>
<p>Echinochlaenia, commonly known as the spiny grass or false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plants typically have slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, clustered inflorescences. Echinochlaenia species are characterized by their tough, fibrous structure, which makes them resilient to grazing and environmental stress.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats.</p>
