                    <h1>Ephedrides</h1>
<p>Ephedrides, commonly known as ephedra, are a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ephedraceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their shrub-like growth form and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The stems of ephedra species contain alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Their evolutionary adaptations include reduced leaves and a thick cuticle to minimize water loss.</p>
