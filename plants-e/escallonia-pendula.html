                    <h1>Escallonia pendula</h1>
<p>Escallonia pendula, commonly known as the weeping escallonia, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang gracefully from the plant, creating a weeping effect. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans.</p>
<p>Escallonia pendula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
