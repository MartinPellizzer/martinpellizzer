<p>Eleocharis consanguinea, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize moist soils.</p>
<p>Eleocharis consanguinea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
