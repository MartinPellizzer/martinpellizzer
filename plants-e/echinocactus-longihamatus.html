<p>Echinocactus longihamatus, commonly known as the long-armed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>The spines, which are both protective and ornamental, are often long and can vary in color from yellow to brown.</p>
