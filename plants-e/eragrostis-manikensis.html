<p>Eragrostis manikensis, commonly known as the Manikensis lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
