<p>Eriocaulon subalatum, commonly known as the alpine marsh grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
