<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas. Its tiny, pale brown to reddish-brown fruits are enclosed in a protective bract, which helps in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
