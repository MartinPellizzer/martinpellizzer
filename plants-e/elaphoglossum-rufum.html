<p>Elaphoglossum rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- to tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum rufum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
