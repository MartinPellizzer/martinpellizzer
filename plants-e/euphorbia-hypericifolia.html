<p>Euphorbia hypericifolia, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hypericifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
