                    <h1>Eriogonum kearneyi var. monoense</h1>
<p>Eriogonum kearneyi var. monoense, commonly known as the Mono Lake buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly around Mono Lake in California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions with deep taproots for water absorption. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
