<p>Eriosyce islayensis subsp.</p>
<p>divaricatiflora, commonly known as the Islay Island torch cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the wet season, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to the arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
