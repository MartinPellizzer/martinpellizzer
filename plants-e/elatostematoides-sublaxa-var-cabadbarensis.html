<p>Elatostematoides sublaxa var. cabadbarensis, commonly known as the Cabadbaran liverwort, is a species of liverwort found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus with a smooth, greenish surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including antheridiola and archegonia, are embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
