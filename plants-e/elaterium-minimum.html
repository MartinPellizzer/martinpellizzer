                    <h1>Elaterium minimum</h1>
<p>Elaterium minimum, commonly known as the small bladder nut, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like fruits that encase the seeds, a unique adaptation for seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaterium minimum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
