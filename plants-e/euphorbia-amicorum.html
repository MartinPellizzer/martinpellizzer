                    <h1>Euphorbia amicorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia amicorum, commonly known as the friendship euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia amicorum is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
