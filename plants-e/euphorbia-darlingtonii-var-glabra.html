                    <h1>Euphorbia darlingtonii var. glabra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia darlingtonii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a smooth, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structures.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
