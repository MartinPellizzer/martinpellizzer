                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale f. intermedium</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its intermediate morphology between the typical E. hyemale and other related species.</p>
