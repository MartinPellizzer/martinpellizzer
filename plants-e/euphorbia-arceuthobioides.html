                    <h1>Euphorbia arceuthobioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arceuthobioides, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, candle-like stem that is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
