<p>Erica corifolia var. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
