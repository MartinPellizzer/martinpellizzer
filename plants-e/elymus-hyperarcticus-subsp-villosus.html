<p>Elymus hyperarcticus subsp.</p>
<p>villosus, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open tundra and rocky habitats, where it forms extensive mats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like structure with pale green to brownish glumes.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife.</p>
