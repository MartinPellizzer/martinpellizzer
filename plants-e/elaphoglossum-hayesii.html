<p>Elaphoglossum hayesii, commonly known as Hayes' holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
