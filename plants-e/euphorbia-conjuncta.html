                    <h1>Euphorbia conjuncta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia conjuncta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
