                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudosaxatilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudosaxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
