<p>Euphorbia lundelliana, commonly known as the Lundell's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, care should be taken to avoid contact with its sap.</p>
