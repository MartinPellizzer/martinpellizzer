                    <h1>Euphorbia shetoensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia shetoensis, commonly known as the Shetland spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to the Shetland Islands in Scotland.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
