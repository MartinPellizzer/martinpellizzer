                    <h1>Epipactis helleborine var. sayekiana</h1>
<p>Epipactis helleborine var. sayekiana, commonly known as the Sayek's helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, greenish-black seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical form of E. helleborine.</p>
