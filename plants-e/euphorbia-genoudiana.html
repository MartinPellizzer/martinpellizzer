<p>Euphorbia genoudiana, commonly known as the Genoud's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its tissues.</p>
<p>Euphorbia genoudiana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
