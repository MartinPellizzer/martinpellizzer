                    <h1>Effusiella henrique-aragonii</h1>
<p>Effusiella henrique-aragonii, commonly known as the Henry-Aragon fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing soruses located on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
