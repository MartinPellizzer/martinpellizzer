<p>Eremophila imbricata, commonly known as the Heath Myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eremophila imbricata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
