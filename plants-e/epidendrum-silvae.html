<p>Epidendrum silvae, commonly known as the forest epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often arranged in a spike.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
