                    <h1>Erica demissa var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Erica demissa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica demissa var. crassifolia is often used in coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained conditions.</p>
