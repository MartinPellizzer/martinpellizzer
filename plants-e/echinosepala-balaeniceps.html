                    <h1>Echinosepala balaeniceps</h1>
<p>Echinosepala balaeniceps, commonly known as the whalehead cactus, is a unique succulent native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Echinosepala balaeniceps is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
