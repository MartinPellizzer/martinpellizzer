                    <h1>Euonymus verrucosus var. semenovii</h1>
<p>Euonymus verrucosus var. semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian spurge or Semenov's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a striking feature of the species. It is often found growing in rocky or forested areas, where it can tolerate low light and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
