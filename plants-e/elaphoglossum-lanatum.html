<p>Elaphoglossum lanatum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum lanatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
