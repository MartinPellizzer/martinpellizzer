                    <h1>Euphorbia saturejoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia saturejoides, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
