                    <h1>Eragrostis atrovirens var. hesperidum</h1>
<p>Eragrostis atrovirens var. hesperidum, commonly known as the desert panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
