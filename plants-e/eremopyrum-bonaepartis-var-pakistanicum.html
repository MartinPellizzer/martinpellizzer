<p>Eremopyrum bonaepartis var. pakistanicum, commonly known as the Pakistan sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
