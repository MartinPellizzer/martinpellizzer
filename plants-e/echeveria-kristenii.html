                    <h1>Echeveria kristenii</h1>
<p>Echeveria kristenii, commonly known as the "Pink Cloud," is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically pale green with a pinkish or reddish tinge. The leaves are densely packed, creating a visually appealing, rounded shape. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
