                    <h1>Euphorbia clarionensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia clarionensis, commonly known as the Clarion spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small, paddle-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia clarionensis is also noted for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
