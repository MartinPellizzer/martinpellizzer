<p>Euxolus emarginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euxolus emarginatus is valued in horticulture for its resilience and unique appearance.</p>
