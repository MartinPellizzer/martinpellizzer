                    <h1>Erica uncifolia</h1>
<p>Erica uncifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Erica uncifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
