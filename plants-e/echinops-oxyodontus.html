<p>Echinops oxyodontus, commonly known as the sharp-toothed thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinops oxyodontus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
