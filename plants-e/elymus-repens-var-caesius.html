<p>Elymus repens var. caesius, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are typically a striking purple or reddish color, which distinguishes it from other varieties. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in meadows, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas where it can spread vegetatively through rhizomes.</p>
