<p>Eragrostis pastoensis, commonly known as Pasto grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often growing in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological restoration, Eragrostis pastoensis is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
