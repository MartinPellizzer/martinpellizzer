                    <h1>Euphorbia zierioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia zierioides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Euphorbia zierioides is well adapted to rocky, dry habitats and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
