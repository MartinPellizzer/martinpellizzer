                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis var. leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white fruit palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark purple of the common oil palm. The plant is a tall, slender tree with pinnately compound leaves and produces clusters of fruits that are harvested for their edible nuts. Its botanical features make it distinct in appearance and useful for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated for oil production compared to other varieties of Elaeis guineensis.</p>
