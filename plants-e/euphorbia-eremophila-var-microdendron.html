                    <h1>Euphorbia eremophila var. microdendron</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eremophila var. microdendron, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique, spiky inflorescences that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a rock garden or container plant.</p>
