                    <h1>Encephalosphaera puberula</h1>
<p>Encephalosphaera puberula, commonly known as the velvet cup, is a small, saprophytic fungus that belongs to the family Sarcodiniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cup-shaped, velvety cap that ranges in color from yellowish to reddish-brown. The fruiting bodies are typically found on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structure, known as the ascus, is embedded within the cup and releases spores through a small, circular opening.</p>
<p>This species is often encountered in temperate regions and is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
