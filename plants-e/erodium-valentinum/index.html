                            <h1>Erodium Valentinum</h1>
<p>Erodium valentinum is a small, flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is known for its delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant often grows in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields and along roadsides. Its common name, "Love-lies-bleeding," reflects its striking appearance and historical associations. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, making it both admired and problematic.</p>
