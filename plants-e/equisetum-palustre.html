                    <h1>Equisetum palustre</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre, commonly known as marsh horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that is typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili at the top of the stem, which are often referred to as "spore cones.". Equisetum palustre thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of acidic and poorly drained soil conditions.</p>
