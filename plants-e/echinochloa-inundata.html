<p>Echinochloa inundata, commonly known as watergrass, is a species of grass native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Echinochloa inundata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
