<p>Epithelantha pachyrhiza var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sun cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of fleshy, spiny stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique morphology and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
