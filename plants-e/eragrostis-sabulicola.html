<p>Eragrostis sabulicola, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed heads that are typically pink to reddish in color, adding visual interest to its appearance. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Eragrostis sabulicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
