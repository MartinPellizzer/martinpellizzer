                    <h1>Epithema sarawakense</h1>
<p>Epithema sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak epiphyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features small, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy layers of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
