                    <h1>Eriosorus</h1>
<p>Eriosorus, commonly known as the silky fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, soft fronds covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>These hairs, known as trichomes, give the plant its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss in dry environments. Eriosorus species are typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a graceful, arching growth habit.</p>
<p>This genus is part of the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
