                    <h1>Emmenanthe</h1>
<p>Emmenanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, featuring a single, delicate leaf and a flower that resembles a ghostly, translucent bloom. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
