                    <h1>Equisetum arvense f. microstachyum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense f. microstachyum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
