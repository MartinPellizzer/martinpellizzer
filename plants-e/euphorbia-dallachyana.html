                    <h1>Euphorbia dallachyana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dallachyana, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems and leaves that are often reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its waxy cuticle and succulent leaves help it store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dallachyana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
