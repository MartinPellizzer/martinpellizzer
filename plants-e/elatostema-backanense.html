<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. Its botanical structure is characterized by a short, underground stem and a lack of true leaves, with the photosynthetic function carried out by the leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Elatostema backanense is part of the family Bryophyta, though it is actually a member of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
