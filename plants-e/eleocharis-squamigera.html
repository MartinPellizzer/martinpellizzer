                    <h1>Eleocharis squamigera</h1>
<p>Eleocharis squamigera, commonly known as the flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Eleocharis squamigera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of fluctuating water levels and ability to improve soil quality.</p>
