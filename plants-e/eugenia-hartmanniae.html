<p>Eugenia hartmanniae, commonly known as the Hartmann's eugenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Following flowering, it produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eugenia hartmanniae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
