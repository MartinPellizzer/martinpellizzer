                    <h1>Eleocharis fallax</h1>
<p>Eleocharis fallax, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis fallax is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
