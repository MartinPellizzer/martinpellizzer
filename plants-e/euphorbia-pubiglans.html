<p>Euphorbia pubiglans, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, pubescent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. Euphorbia pubiglans is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
