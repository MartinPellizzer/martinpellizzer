                    <h1>Euphorbia iberica var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia iberica var. intermedia, commonly known as the Iberian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation or study.</p>
