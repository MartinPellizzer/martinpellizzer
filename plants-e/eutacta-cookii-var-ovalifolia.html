The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
