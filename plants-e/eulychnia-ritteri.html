<p>Eulychnia ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Eulychnia ritteri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary adaptations to extreme desert conditions.</p>
