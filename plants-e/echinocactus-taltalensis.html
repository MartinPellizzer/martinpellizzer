                    <h1>Echinocactus taltalensis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
