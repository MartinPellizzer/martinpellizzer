<p>Euryops caespitosus, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow dandelion-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy white seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euryops caespitosus is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
