<p>Erigeron seemannii, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
