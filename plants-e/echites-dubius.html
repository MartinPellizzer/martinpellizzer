                    <h1>Echites dubius</h1>
<p>Echites dubius, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Echites dubius is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions.</p>
