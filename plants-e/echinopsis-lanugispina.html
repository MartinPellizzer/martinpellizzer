<p>Echinopsis lanugispina, commonly known as the Wooly Echinopsis, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale blue hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear spines and flowers.</p>
<p>Echinopsis lanugispina is well adapted to drought and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
