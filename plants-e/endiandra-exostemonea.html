<p>Endiandra exostemonea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface.
