                    <h1>Evelyna glomera</h1>
<p>Evelyna glomera, commonly known as the silverleaf gloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pale blue and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Evelyna glomera is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
