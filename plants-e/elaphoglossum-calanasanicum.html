                    <h1>Elaphoglossum calanasanicum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum calanasanicum, commonly known as the cloud forest holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the humid montane forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
