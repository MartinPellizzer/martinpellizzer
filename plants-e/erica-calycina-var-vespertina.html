<p>Erica calycina var. vespertina, commonly known as the evening heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
