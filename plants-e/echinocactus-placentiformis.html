<p>Echinocactus placentiformis, commonly known as the placenta cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its fleshy, water-storing stems help it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus placentiformis is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
