<p>Euphorbia schlechtendalii var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
