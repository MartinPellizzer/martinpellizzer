<p>Empetrum nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>subholarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, dark blue-black berries and needle-like leaves. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, showcasing adaptations to harsh Arctic and alpine conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects, depending on the region. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more northern distribution compared to other Empetrum species, reflecting its specialized ecological niche.</p>
