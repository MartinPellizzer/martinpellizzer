                    <h1>Erysimum aridum</h1>
<p>Erysimum aridum, commonly known as the desert wallflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with narrow, linear leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
