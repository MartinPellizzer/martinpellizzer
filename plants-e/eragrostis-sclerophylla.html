                    <h1>Eragrostis sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Eragrostis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is used in some regions for erosion control and as a ornamental plant.</p>
