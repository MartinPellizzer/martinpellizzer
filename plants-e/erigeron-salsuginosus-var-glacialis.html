                    <h1>Erigeron salsuginosus var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Erigeron salsuginosus var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier fleabane, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss in arid, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in alpine tundra and is an important component of the flora in mountainous regions.</p>
