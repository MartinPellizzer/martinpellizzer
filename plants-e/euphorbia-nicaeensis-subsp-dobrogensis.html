<p>Euphorbia nicaeensis subsp.</p>
<p>dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting it to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
