                    <h1>Eplingia</h1>
<p>Eplingia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Eplingia species are native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
