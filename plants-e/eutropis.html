                    <h1>Eutropis</h1>
<p>Eutropis, commonly known as the threadtail skink, is a genus of lizard belonging to the family Scincidae.</p>
<p>These small, agile reptiles are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their slender bodies, long tails, and smooth, often colorful scales. Eutropis species typically inhabit rocky areas, leaf litter, or dense vegetation, where they forage for insects and other small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Their botanical relevance lies in their role as indicators of ecosystem health and their interaction with plant life in their habitats.</p>
