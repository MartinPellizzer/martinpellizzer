                    <h1>Eucalyptus pyrophora var. polycarpa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus pyrophora var. polycarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are typically broader than those of other eucalyptus species. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and fire.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its variable fruit structure, with some individuals producing multiple clustered fruits.</p>
