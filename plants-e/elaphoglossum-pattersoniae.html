<p>Elaphoglossum pattersoniae, commonly known as the Patterson's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized fern species.</p>
