                    <h1>Eriogonum breedlovei var. breedlovei</h1>
<p>Eriogonum breedlovei var. breedlovei, commonly known as the Breddle's buckwheat, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyons, where it has adapted to poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
