<p>Euphorbia rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove euphorbia, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a succulent stem with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Its leaves are alternate and often reduced to small scales, while the flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rhizophora plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
