                    <h1>Elymus rectisetus</h1>
<p>Elymus rectisetus, commonly known as the stiff-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with stiff, bristly hairs along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Elymus rectisetus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
