                    <h1>Euphorbia obovata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lanceolate, often gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia obovata is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
