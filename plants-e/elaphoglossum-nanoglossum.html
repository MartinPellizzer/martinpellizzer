                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nanoglossum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nanoglossum, commonly known as the small-leaf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in understory plant communities.</p>
