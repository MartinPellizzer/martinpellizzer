                    <h1>Eleocharis variegata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis variegata, commonly known as the variable spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often tinged with green and brown, giving it its variegated appearance. Its small, triangular spikelets are clustered at the top of the stems, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Eleocharis variegata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
