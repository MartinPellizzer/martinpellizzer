                    <h1>Edwardia caricifolia</h1>
<p>Edwardia caricifolia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
