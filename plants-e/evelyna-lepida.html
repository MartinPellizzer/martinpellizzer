                    <h1>Evelyna lepida</h1>
<p>Evelyna lepida, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery down that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
