                            <h1>Eulophia Turkestanica</h1>
<p>Eulophia turkestanica is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This elegant plant is known for its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered by conservationists. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and botanical admiration.</p>
