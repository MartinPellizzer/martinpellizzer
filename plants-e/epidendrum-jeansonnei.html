<p>Epidendrum jeansonnei, commonly known as the Jeansonne's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>

The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
