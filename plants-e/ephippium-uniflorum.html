                    <h1>Ephippium uniflorum</h1>
<p>Ephippium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered ephippium, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Ephippiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a single flower enclosed within a protective, cup-like structure called an ephippium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary humidity and nutrients. Its reproductive strategy involves the dispersal of its seeds through the ephippium, which can remain dormant until favorable conditions arise.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ephippium uniflorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
