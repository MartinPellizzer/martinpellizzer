<p>Elaeagnus magna var. magna, commonly known as silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by reddish-brown berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
