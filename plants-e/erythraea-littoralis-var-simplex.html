<p>Erythraea littoralis var. simplex, commonly known as the coastal erythraea, is a rare variant of the erythraea plant species.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal regions where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it resilient in harsh maritime environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
