                    <h1>Elymus dasystachys f. glaber</h1>
<p>Elymus dasystachys f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous wild rye, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The glabrous (hairless) texture of its leaves distinguishes this subspecies from others in the genus.</p>
