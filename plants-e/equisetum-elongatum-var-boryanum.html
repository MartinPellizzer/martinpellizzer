                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. boryanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum horsetail, is a species of horsetail native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are often clustered in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in shaded areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly shorter stems and more compact growth form compared to other equisetum species.</p>
