                    <h1>Elaphoglossum haitiense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum haitiense, commonly known as the Haitian holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, specifically Haiti.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum haitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
