<p>Eucalyptus macrorhyncha subsp.</p>
<p>cannonii, commonly known as the Cape York gum, is a tall, slender eucalyptus species native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It produces woody capsules containing viable seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open forests or woodlands.</p>
