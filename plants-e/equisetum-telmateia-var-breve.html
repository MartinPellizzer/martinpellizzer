                    <h1>Equisetum telmateia var. breve</h1>
<p>Equisetum telmateia var. breve, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wetland environments. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution.</p>
