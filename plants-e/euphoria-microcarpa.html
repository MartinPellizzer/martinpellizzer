                    <h1>Euphoria microcarpa</h1>
<p>Euphoria microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited euphorbia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphoria microcarpa is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and unique appearance.</p>
