<p>Erodium cicutarium proles provinciale, commonly known as the common stork's bill, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a distinctive, beak-like capsule, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Erodium. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
