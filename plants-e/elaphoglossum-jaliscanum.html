<p>Elaphoglossum jaliscanum, commonly known as the Jalisco holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Native to Mexico, particularly the state of Jalisco, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
