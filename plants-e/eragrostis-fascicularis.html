<p>Eragrostis fascicularis, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
