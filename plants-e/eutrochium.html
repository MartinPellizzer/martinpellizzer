<p>Eutrochium, commonly known as boneset, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. Eutrochium species typically grow in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and are often found in the eastern United States.
