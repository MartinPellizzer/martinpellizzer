                    <h1>Euphorbia laevigata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy, smooth cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia laevigata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
