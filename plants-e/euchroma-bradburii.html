                    <h1>Euchroma bradburii</h1>
<p>Euchroma bradburii, commonly known as the Bradburry's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to specific regions of South America and is often found in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
