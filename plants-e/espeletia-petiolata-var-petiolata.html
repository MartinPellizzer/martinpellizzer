                    <h1>Espeletia petiolata var. petiolata</h1>
<p>Espeletia petiolata var. petiolata, commonly known as the rosette plant or the "puya," is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
