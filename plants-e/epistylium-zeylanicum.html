<p>Epistylium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian epistylium, is a colonial marine algae belonging to the order Rhodophyta.</p>
<p>It forms dense, bushy colonies that are often found attached to substrates such as shells, stones, or other marine organisms. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure composed of numerous filaments and protuberances, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its reddish coloration is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment common in red algae.</p>
<p>Epistylium zeylanicum plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
