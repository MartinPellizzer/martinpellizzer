<p>Eragrostis mauiensis, commonly known as Maui grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dryland environments. Its fine, silver-green leaves contribute to its ornamental value, while its hardy nature allows it to withstand drought and salt spray.</p>
<p>Maui grass is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover.</p>
