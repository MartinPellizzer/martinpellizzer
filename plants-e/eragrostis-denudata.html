                    <h1>Eragrostis denudata</h1>
<p>Eragrostis denudata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Eragrostis denudata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
