                    <h1>Eriophorum scheuchzeri var. scheuchzeri</h1>
<p>Eriophorum scheuchzeri var. scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in alpine tundra or mountain meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to cold and harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
