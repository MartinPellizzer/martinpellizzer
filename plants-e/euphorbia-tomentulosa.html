                    <h1>Euphorbia tomentulosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
