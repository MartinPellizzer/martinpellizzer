<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. gabriuscula, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
