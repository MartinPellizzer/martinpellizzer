                    <h1>Enchylaena physophora</h1>
<p>Enchylaena physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
