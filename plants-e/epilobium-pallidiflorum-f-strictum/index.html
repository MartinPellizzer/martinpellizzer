<p>Common willow herb, scientifically known as Epilobium pallidiflorum f. strictum, is a unique variant of the common willow herb found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is characterized by its compact growth form and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in areas with high altitude and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for certain pollinators and its ability to stabilize fragile mountainous terrain.</p>
