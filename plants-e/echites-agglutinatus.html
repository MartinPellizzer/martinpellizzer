<p>Echites agglutinatus, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known species like tomatoes and peppers. Its fruits are typically small berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans.</p>
<p>The sticky resin it exudes is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxicity.</p>
