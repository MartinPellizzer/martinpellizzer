                    <h1>Endocarpa</h1>
<p>Endocarpa, commonly known as the innermost layer of the fruit's pericarp, is a critical botanical structure in many plants.</p>
<p>It is typically composed of parenchyma cells and often contains the seeds. The endocarp can be fleshy, woody, or stony, depending on the species. In some fruits, such as peaches, it forms a hard, protective covering around the seeds.</p>
<p>This layer plays a vital role in seed dispersal and protection.</p>
