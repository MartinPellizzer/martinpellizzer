                    <h1>Erica humifusa</h1>
<p>Erica humifusa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and form a mat-like structure, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Erica humifusa is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
