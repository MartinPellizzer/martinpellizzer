                    <h1>Echeveria sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Echeveria sessiliflora, commonly known as the Rosette Echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
