                    <h1>Ervatamia bonii</h1>
<p>Ervatamia bonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Ervatamia bonii is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
