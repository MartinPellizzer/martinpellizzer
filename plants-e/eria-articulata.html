<p>Eria articulata, commonly known as the jointed eria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Eria articulata is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology, including its jointed stems, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
