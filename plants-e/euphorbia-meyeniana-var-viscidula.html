                    <h1>Euphorbia meyeniana var. viscidula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia meyeniana var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>The sticky resin also serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
