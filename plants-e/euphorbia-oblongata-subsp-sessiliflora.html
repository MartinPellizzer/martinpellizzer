<p>Euphorbia oblongata subsp.</p>
<p>sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation.</p>
