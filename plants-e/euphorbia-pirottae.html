                    <h1>Euphorbia pirottae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pirottae, commonly known as the Pirotta's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually green and fleshy, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pirottae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
