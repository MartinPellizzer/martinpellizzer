                    <h1>Eleocharis wichurae f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Eleocharis wichurae f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a variant of the spike-rush genus Eleocharis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive feature, where the inflorescences produce viviparous shoots that can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait is rare among sedges and contributes to its ecological significance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of plant reproduction and adaptation.</p>
