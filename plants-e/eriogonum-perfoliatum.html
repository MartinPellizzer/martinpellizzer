The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are often fused around the stem, a feature known as perfoliate, which gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
