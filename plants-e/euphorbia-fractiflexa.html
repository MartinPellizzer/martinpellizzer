<p>Euphorbia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fractiflexa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
