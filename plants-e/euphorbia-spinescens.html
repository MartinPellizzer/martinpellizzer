                    <h1>Euphorbia spinescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne on short, branched inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia spinescens is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and resilience in dry environments.</p>
