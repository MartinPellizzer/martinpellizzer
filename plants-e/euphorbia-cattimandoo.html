                    <h1>Euphorbia cattimandoo</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cattimandoo, commonly known as the Ceylon spurge, is a succulent plant native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cattimandoo is also noted for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
