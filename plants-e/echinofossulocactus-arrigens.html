                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus arrigens</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus arrigens, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, spiny cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The spines, which are typically yellow or brown, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
