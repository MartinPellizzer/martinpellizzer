<p>Eumachia chlorocalyx, commonly known as the green-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and other angiosperms, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Eumachia chlorocalyx is native to regions of Australia and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
