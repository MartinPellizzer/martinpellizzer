                    <h1>Equisetum laevigatum f. proliferum</h1>
<p>Equisetum laevigatum f. proliferum, commonly known as the smooth horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its slender, unbranched stems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history. The plant features whorls of small, needle-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through its creeping rhizomes, which contribute to its invasive potential in certain environments.</p>
