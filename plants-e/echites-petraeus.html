                    <h1>Echites petraeus</h1>
<p>Echites petraeus, commonly known as the rock echites, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echites petraeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
