                    <h1>Encephalartos eugene-maraisii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos eugene-maraisii, commonly known as the Eugene-Marais cycad, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with mild temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
