                    <h1>Euphlebium elineae</h1>
<p>Euphlebium elineae, commonly known as the Elinea fern, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Euphlebiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or along streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Euphlebium elineae is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
