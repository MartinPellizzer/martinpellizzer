<p>Epiphyllum × splendidum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are typically green and succulent, adapted for storing water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, pink, or red. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning.</p>
<p>Epiphyllum × splendidum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
