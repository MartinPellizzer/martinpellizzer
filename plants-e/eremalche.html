                    <h1>Eremalche</h1>
<p>Eremalche, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their ability to thrive in dry environments. Eremalche species often have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. The flowers are usually showy, with five petals and a prominent central style, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
