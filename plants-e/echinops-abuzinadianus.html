<p>Echinops abuzinadianus, commonly known as the Aztec thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a crown of thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Echinops abuzinadianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
