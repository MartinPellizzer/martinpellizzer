                    <h1>Elaphoglossum gloeorrhizum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum gloeorrhizum, commonly known as the gloeorrhizous harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across the temperate regions of the Americas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
