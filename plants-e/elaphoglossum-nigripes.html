                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nigripes</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum nigripes thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it forms dense mats on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems.</p>
