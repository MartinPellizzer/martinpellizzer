                    <h1>Elionurus tenax</h1>
<p>Elionurus tenax, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Elionurus tenax thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in wetland environments and as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals.</p>
