<p>Epipactis campeadorii, commonly known as the Campeador orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific bee species, which are attracted to its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
