                    <h1>Elaphrium simplicifolium</h1>
<p>Elaphrium simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaf elaphrium, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by oval, dry fruits known as follicles. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
