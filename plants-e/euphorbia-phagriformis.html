<p>Euphorbia phagriformis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure common in the Euphorbiaceae family.
