<p>Eulalia madkotiensis, commonly known as the Madkotien grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grassland regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to tolerate drought and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
