<p>Euphorbia madinahensis, commonly known as the Madinah spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
