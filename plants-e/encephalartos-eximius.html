<p>Encephalartos eximius, commonly known as the Natal mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid and often covered in a spiny coating. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
