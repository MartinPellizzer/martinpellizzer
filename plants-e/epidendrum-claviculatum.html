                    <h1>Epidendrum claviculatum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum claviculatum, commonly known as the Clavicle Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with a distinctive red or purple lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Epidendrum claviculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment.</p>
