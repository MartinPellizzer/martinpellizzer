<p>Eriogonum caespitosum, commonly known as sticky yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and foothill habitats.</p>
<p>Eriogonum caespitosum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
