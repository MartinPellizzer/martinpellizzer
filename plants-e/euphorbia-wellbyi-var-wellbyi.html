                    <h1>Euphorbia wellbyi var. wellbyi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia wellbyi var. wellbyi, commonly known as the Wellby's spurflower, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
