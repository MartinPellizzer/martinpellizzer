<p>Eucalyptus populnea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallet tree, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus populnea is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
