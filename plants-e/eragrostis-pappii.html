<p>Eragrostis pappii, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, wiry stems that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Eragrostis pappii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
