<p>Epipactis nordeniorum subsp.</p>
<p>mecsekensis, commonly known as the Mecsek marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mecsek Mountains in Hungary. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
