                    <h1>Ectrosia appressa</h1>
<p>Ectrosia appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ectrosia appressa is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
