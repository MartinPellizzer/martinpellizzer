<p>Epidendrum chingazaense, commonly known as the Chingaza orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a thick, leathery epidermis, aiding in water storage.</p>
<p>Epidendrum chingazaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
