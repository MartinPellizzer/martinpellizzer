<p>Euphorbia chaetocalyx, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chaetocalyx is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
