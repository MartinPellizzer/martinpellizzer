                    <h1>Efossus phyllacanthus</h1>
<p>Efossus phyllacanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected botanical gardens.</p>
