                    <h1>Euphoriopsis</h1>
<p>Euphoriopsis, commonly known as the false euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble the structure of true euphorbias. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which serve to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Euphoriopsis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
