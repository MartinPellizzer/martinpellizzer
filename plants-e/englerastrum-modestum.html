<p>Englerastrum modestum, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Englerastrum modestum is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
