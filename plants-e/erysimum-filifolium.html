                    <h1>Erysimum filifolium</h1>
<p>Erysimum filifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
