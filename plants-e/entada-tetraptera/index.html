                            <h1>Entada Tetraptera</h1>
<p>Cocowood, scientifically known as Entada tetraptera, is a remarkable tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is prized for its unique, lightweight yet durable wood, which has been used for centuries in traditional crafts and construction. The tree's striking appearance, with its long, slender pods and showy flowers, makes it a standout in natural landscapes. Despite its beauty and utility, Cocowood faces threats from overharvesting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are increasingly important to ensure its survival for future generations.</p>
