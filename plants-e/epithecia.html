                    <h1>Epithecia</h1>
<p>Epithecia, commonly known as crustose lichens, are a type of lichen that form a thin, crust-like layer on surfaces such as rocks, bark, or soil.</p>
<p>They are composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The fungal component, known as the mycobiont, provides structure and protection, while the photobiont carries out photosynthesis. Epithecia are often difficult to remove from surfaces due to their tightly adhered structure.</p>
<p>These lichens play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in various environments.</p>
