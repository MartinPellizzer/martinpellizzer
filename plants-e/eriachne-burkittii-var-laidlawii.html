                    <h1>Eriachne burkittii var. laidlawii</h1>
<p>Eriachne burkittii var. laidlawii, commonly known as the Laidlaw's spinifex, is a grass species native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wiry, spiky foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue or whitish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
