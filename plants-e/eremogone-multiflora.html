                    <h1>Eremogone multiflora</h1>
<p>Eremogone multiflora, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremogone multiflora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals.</p>
