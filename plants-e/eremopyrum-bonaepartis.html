<p>Eremopyrum bonaepartis, commonly known as the Bonaepartis sedge, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
