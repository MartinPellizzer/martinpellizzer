<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
