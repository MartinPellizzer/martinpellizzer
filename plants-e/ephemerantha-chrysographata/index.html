                            <h1>Ephemerantha Chrysographata</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha chrysographata is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. Known for its striking yellow-green foliage and ephemeral blooms, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This plant is often found in cloud forests where it clings to rocky substrates. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered. Its beauty and fragility make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
