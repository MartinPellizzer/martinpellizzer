                    <h1>Euphorbia herbacea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herbacea, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
