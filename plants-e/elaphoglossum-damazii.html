                    <h1>Elaphoglossum damazii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum damazii, commonly known as the Damazian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered along the margins of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum damazii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
