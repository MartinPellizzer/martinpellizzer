                    <h1>Elymus sabulosus var. depauperatus</h1>
<p>Elymus sabulosus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and reduced leaf structure, which are adaptations to its moist, often saline habitat. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing wind-pollinated seeds that disperse easily.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
