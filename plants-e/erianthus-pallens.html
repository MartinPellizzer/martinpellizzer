<p>Erianthus pallens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Erianthus pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
