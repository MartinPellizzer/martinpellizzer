<p>Elymus regelii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus regelii is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
