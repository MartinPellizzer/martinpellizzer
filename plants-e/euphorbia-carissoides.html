<p>Euphorbia carissoides, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy, greenish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia carissoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
