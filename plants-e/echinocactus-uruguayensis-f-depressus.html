<p>Echinocactus uruguayensis f. depressus, commonly known as the Uruguayensis Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique variant of the Echinocactus genus native to Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The stems are typically green and slightly ribbed, with a thick, fleshy texture that helps store water. It produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild.</p>
