                    <h1>Epithelantha micromeris f. elongata</h1>
<p>Epithelantha micromeris f. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed living stone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for rocks due to their color and texture. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
