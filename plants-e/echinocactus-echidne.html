                    <h1>Echinocactus echidne</h1>
<p>Echinocactus echidne, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus echidne is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
