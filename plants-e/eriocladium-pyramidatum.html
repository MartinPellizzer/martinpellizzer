<p>Eriocladium pyramidatum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
