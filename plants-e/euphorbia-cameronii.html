                    <h1>Euphorbia cameronii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments with its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cameronii is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
