<p>Eumecanthus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils, often found in mountainous or arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Eumecanthus calcicola is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
