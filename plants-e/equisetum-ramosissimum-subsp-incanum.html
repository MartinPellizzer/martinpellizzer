<p>Equisetum ramosissimum subsp.</p>
<p>incanum, commonly known as the silver fir or slender horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores rather than flowers, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
