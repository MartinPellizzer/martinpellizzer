                    <h1>Elytrigia jacutorum</h1>
<p>Elytrigia jacutorum, commonly known as sea grass or coastal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Elytrigia jacutorum plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
