<p>Euphorbia anacampseros, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage and branched stems that often form a compact, mound-like shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
