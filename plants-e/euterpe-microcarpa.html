<p>Euterpe microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf palm or buriti-doce, is a small, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters and features a slender trunk covered in persistent leaf bases.

Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that contribute to its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Euterpe microcarpa is valued for its fruit, which is consumed by both wildlife and humans, and for its potential ecological and economic importance in tropical regions.</p>
