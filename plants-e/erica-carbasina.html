                    <h1>Erica carbasina</h1>
<p>Erica carbasina, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica carbasina is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
