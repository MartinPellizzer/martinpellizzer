<p>Ecbolium diffusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>Ecbolium diffusum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
