<p>Epidendrum subaequale, commonly known as the equal-leaf orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant features linear, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Epidendrum subaequale thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
