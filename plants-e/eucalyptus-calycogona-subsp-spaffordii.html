<p>Eucalyptus calycogona subsp.</p>
<p>spaffordii, commonly known as the Spafford's malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months of spring and autumn. It is well adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
