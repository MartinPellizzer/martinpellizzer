                    <h1>Ephemerantha kunstleri</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha kunstleri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and ephemeral plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear only briefly during the rainy season. The plant's unique morphology includes a low-growing rosette structure with narrow, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pink, are short-lived, often lasting only a few hours.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ephemerantha kunstleri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
