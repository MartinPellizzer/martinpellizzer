                    <h1>Echinochloa oryzicola</h1>
<p>Echinochloa oryzicola, commonly known as false rice, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and other moist environments, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to cultivated rice, it is sometimes mistaken for a crop and can pose challenges in agricultural settings.</p>
