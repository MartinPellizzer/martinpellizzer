<p>Echites densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower echites, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Echites densiflorus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged drought periods.</p>
