                    <h1>Elatine hydropiper var. tripetala</h1>
<p>Elatine hydropiper var. tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Elatinaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it an important pioneer species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The varietal name "tripetala" refers to the three-lobed shape of its leaves, a distinctive botanical feature.</p>
