<p>Euphorbia grosseri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in a thick layer of pale green, waxy tissue that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine white powder.</p>
<p>Euphorbia grosseri is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for arid garden settings.</p>
