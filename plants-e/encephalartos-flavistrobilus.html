                    <h1>Encephalartos flavistrobilus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos flavistrobilus, commonly known as the yellow-stalked cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-pink cones, with the female cones being particularly striking in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
