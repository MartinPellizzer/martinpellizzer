                    <h1>Epidendrum cogniauxii</h1>
<p>Epidendrum cogniauxii, commonly known as the Cogniaux's orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, helping it store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
