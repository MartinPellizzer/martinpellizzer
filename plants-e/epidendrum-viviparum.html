                    <h1>Epidendrum viviparum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where viable seeds are produced inside the ovary and can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This unique reproductive strategy makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
