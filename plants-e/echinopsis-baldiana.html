                    <h1>Echinopsis baldiana</h1>
<p>Echinopsis baldiana, commonly known as the Bolivian moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and spiny, globular shape. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the night, which is a unique adaptation for pollination by nocturnal insects. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
