<p>Eragrostis eragrostis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
