                    <h1>Elymus petraeus</h1>
<p>Elymus petraeus, commonly known as the rock wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Elymus petraeus thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in degraded or marginal habitats.</p>
