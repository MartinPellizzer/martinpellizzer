<p>Echinocereus adustus subsp.</p>
<p>keizerae, commonly known as the Keizerae Hedgehog Cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
