                    <h1>Eubasis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Eubasis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Eubasis dichotoma is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
