<p>Eriochloa ramosa var. pseudoacrotricha, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch profusely. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats.</p>
