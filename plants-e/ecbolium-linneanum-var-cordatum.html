                    <h1>Ecbolium linneanum var. cordatum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium linneanum var. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf ecbole, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
