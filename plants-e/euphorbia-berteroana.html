                    <h1>Euphorbia berteroana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia berteroana, commonly known as the Bertero's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its branched stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
