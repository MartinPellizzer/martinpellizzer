                    <h1>Erisma calcaratum</h1>
<p>Erisma calcaratum, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like and closely packed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Erisma calcaratum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
