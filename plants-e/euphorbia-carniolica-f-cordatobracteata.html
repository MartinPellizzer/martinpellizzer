<p>Euphorbia carniolica f. cordatobracteata, commonly known as the heart-shaped bract euphorbia, is a unique succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and the bracts are notably large and colorful, enhancing its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
