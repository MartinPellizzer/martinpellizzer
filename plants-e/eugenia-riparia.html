                    <h1>Eugenia riparia</h1>
<p>Eugenia riparia, commonly known as the river eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows along riverbanks and moist woodlands, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries.</p>
<p>These berries are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor and high pectin content.</p>
