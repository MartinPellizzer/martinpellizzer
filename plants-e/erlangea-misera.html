                    <h1>Erlangea misera</h1>
<p>Erlangea misera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom briefly during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Erlangea misera is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
