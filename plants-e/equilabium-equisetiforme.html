                    <h1>Equilabium equisetiforme</h1>
<p>Equilabium equisetiforme, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, herbaceous stem that grows close to the ground. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
