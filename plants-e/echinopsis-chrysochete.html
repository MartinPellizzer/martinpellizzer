                    <h1>Echinopsis chrysochete</h1>
<p>Echinopsis chrysochete, commonly known as the golden echinopsis, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow spines and a globular, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
