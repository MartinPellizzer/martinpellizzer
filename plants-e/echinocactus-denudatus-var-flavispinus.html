                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus var. flavispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. flavispinus, commonly known as the golden spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and collections.</p>
