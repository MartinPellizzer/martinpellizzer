                    <h1>Epithecia australis</h1>
<p>Epithecia australis, commonly known as the Australian cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate to subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish thallus with a distinct, cup-like shape. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental health and biodiversity.</p>
