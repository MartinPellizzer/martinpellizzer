                    <h1>Euphrosyne nevadensis</h1>
<p>Euphrosyne nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada euphrosyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its alpine habitat. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euphrosyne nevadensis is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
