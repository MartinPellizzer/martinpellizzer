                    <h1>Elytrigia attenuata</h1>
<p>Elytrigia attenuata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
