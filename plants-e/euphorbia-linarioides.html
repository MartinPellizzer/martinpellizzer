                    <h1>Euphorbia linarioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia linarioides, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves help it store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia linarioides is also notable for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
