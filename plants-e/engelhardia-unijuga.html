                    <h1>Engelhardia unijuga</h1>
<p>Engelhardia unijuga, commonly known as the single-seeded engelhardia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive single seed enclosed within a woody capsule. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Engelhardia unijuga is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
