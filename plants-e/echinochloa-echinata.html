                    <h1>Echinochloa echinata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa echinata, commonly known as burrsettle, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces spikelets with bristly hairs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, spiny appearance, which aids in dispersal.</p>
<p>Echinochloa echinata is considered a weed in many areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to compete with crops.</p>
