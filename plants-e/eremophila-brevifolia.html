<p>Eremophila brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Eremophila brevifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
