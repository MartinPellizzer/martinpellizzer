                    <h1>Epilobium boreale</h1>
<p>Epilobium boreale, commonly known as the Arctic willow or northern willow, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Epilobium boreale is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
