                    <h1>Euphorbia mauritanica var. foetens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mauritanica var. foetens, commonly known as the stinking euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its strong, unpleasant odor is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
