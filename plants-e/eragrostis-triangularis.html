<p>Eragrostis triangularis, commonly known as three-cornered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
