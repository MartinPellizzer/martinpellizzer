<p>Elaphoglossum wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum wettsteinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
