<p>Echinofossulocactus ochoterenianus, commonly known as the Ochoterenianus cactus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Chile, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its unique structure includes spiny areoles and a compact growth form adapted to extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
