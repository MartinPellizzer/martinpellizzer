<p>Eichlerina elegans, commonly known as the elegant water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small and white, emerging on slender stems above the water.</p>
<p>Eichlerina elegans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
