                    <h1>Erica embolifera</h1>
<p>Erica embolifera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for coastal landscaping.</p>
<p>Erica embolifera plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
