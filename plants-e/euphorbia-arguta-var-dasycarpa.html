                    <h1>Euphorbia arguta var. dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arguta var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it well adapted to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
