                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. attenuatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and historical importance.</p>
