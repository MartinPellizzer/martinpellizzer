<p>Elymus repens f. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by the presence of elongated, aristate (bristle-like) awns on its florets, which distinguish it from the typical form.</p>
