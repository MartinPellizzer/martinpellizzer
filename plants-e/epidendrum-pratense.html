<p>Epidendrum pratense, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas.</p>

Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it thrives in humid, shady environments.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pratense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
