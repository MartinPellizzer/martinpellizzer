<p>Epidorkis carpophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a specialized epiphyte that grows on trees. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and feature intricate, petal-like structures.</p>
<p>Epidorkis carpophora is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
