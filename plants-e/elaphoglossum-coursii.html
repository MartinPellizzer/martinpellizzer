<p>Elaphoglossum coursii, commonly known as the Cours' holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum coursii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
