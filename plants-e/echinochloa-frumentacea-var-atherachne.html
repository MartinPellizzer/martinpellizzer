                    <h1>Echinochloa frumentacea var. atherachne</h1>
<p>Echinochloa frumentacea var. atherachne, commonly known as false rice, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of rice paddies.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to true rice, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
