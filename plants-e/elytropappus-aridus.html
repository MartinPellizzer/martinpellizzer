                    <h1>Elytropappus aridus</h1>
<p>Elytropappus aridus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with hairy, branching stems and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. Elytropappus aridus is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
