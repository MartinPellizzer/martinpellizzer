                    <h1>Euphorbia durispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia durispina, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a cautionary plant for horticulturists.</p>
<p>Euphorbia durispina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
