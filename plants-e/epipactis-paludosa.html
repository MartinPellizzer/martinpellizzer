                    <h1>Epipactis paludosa</h1>
<p>Epipactis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive lip structures. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
