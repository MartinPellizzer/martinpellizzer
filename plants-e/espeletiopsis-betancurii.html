                    <h1>Espeletiopsis betancurii</h1>
<p>Espeletiopsis betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii espeletiopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
