                    <h1>Eurystyles borealis</h1>
<p>Eurystyles borealis, commonly known as the northern eurystyle, is a rare and cold-tolerant plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
