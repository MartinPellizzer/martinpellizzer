                    <h1>Ellipanthus razanatsimae</h1>
<p>Ellipanthus razanatsimae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vibrant purple and white petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited research, the species remains poorly understood and is considered critically endangered.</p>
