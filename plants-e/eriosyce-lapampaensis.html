<p>Eriosyce lapampaensis, commonly known as the Lapampan Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Eriosyce lapampaensis is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
