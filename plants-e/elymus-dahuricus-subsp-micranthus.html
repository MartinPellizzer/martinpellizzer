<p>Elymus dahuricus subsp.</p>
<p>micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
