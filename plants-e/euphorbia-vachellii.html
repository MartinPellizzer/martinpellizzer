                    <h1>Euphorbia vachellii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vachellii, commonly known as the vachellii spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vachellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
