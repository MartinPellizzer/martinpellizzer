<p>Elymus giganteus var. sabulosus, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
