                    <h1>Euphorbia coscinosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia coscinosperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia coscinosperma is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
