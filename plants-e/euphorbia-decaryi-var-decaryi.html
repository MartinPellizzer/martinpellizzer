                    <h1>Euphorbia decaryi var. decaryi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia decaryi var. decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
