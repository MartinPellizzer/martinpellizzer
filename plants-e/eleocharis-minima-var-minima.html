                    <h1>Eleocharis minima var. minima</h1>
<p>Eleocharis minima var. minima, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, grass-like plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is often found in marshes, swales, and other moist habitats, particularly in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually short and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
