                    <h1>Euphorbia papilligera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia papilligera, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia papilligera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
