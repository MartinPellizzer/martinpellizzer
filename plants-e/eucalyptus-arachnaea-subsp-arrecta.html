<p>Eucalyptus arachnaea subsp.</p>
<p>arrecta, commonly known as the hairy ringed gum, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ringed bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine, white hairs, especially on the underside. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
