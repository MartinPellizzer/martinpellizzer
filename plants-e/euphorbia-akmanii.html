                    <h1>Euphorbia akmanii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia akmanii, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia akmanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
