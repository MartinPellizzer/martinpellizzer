                    <h1>Eria sicaria</h1>
<p>Eria sicaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, green leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
