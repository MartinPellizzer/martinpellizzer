                            <h1>Erasanthe Henrici</h1>
<p>Erasanthe henrici is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered by conservationists. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination.</p>
