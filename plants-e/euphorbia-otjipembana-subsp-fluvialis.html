<p>Euphorbia otjipembana subsp.</p>
<p>fluvialis, commonly known as the river euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
