<p>Elymus kronokensis subsp.</p>
<p>scandicus, commonly known as the Scandic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a tufted appearance at the base, and it produces loose, feathery inflorescences during the summer months. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to wet conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
