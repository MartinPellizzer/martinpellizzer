<p>Euphorbia celastroides var. kohalana, commonly known as the Kohala euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
