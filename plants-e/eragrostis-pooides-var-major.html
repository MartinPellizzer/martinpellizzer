<p>Eragrostis pooides var. major, commonly known as tall false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
