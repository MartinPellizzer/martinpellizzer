<p>Encyclia isochila var. tridens, commonly known as the Trident Encyclia, is a species of orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with three distinct sepals and petals. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The variety tridens refers to the three-toothed appearance of its floral lips, a distinguishing feature of this orchid.</p>
