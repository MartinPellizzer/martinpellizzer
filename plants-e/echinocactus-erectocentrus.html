<p>Echinocactus erectocentrus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at the top of the stems during the warmer months. Its adaptations include a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus erectocentrus is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
