<p>Euphrasia arctica f. minutissima, commonly known as the Arctic toothworts, is a rare and diminutive plant species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, erect stems and tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and grows in rocky or mossy habitats, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecology, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
