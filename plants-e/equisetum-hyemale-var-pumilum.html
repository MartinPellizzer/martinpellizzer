                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf horse tail, is a diminutive variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that lack true leaves, instead bearing whorls of small, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are typically found at the apex of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant's ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with unique botanical features.</p>
