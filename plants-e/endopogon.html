                    <h1>Endopogon</h1>
<p>Endopogon, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spikelets that resemble bottle brushes, giving it its common name. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Endopogon species are often used in restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Their small, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to their ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity.</p>
