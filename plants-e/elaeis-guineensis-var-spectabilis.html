                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis var. spectabilis</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis var. spectabilis, commonly known as the ornamental oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm characterized by its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that are often used in horticultural displays rather than for oil production. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a tall, slender trunk.</p>
<p>While it shares genetic similarities with the common oil palm, it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than commercial oil yield.</p>
