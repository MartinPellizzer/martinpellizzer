<p>Epidendrum lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of fragrant, lilac-colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lilacinum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
