<p>Escallonia rubra var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy white flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round structure and low maintenance requirements.</p>
