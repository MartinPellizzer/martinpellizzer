<p>Euphorbia multiceps, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a spiny, succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, green spines that protect it from herbivores.

Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Euphorbia multiceps is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
