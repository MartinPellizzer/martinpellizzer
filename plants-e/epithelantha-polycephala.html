<p>Epithelantha polycephala, commonly known as the clustered jointless cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and the absence of areoles, a feature that distinguishes it from many other cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Epithelantha polycephala is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
