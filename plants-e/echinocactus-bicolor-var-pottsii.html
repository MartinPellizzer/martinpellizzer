                    <h1>Echinocactus bicolor var. pottsii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus bicolor var. pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to blue-gray stems, which are covered in white, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vivid contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
