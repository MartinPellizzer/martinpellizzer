<p>Elythranthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, delicate appearance and are often found growing on trees or in shaded, moist environments. Elythranthera species typically have slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that come in various colors, including white, yellow, and pink. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Elythranthera are considered endangered.</p>
