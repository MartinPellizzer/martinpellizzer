<p>Elaphoglossum ruficomum, commonly known as the red-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside.
