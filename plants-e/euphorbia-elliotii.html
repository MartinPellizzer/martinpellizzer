                    <h1>Euphorbia elliotii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Elliot's spurge is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
