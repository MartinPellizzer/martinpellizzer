                    <h1>Eucalyptus blakelyi var. parvifructa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus blakelyi var. parvifructa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often glaucous in appearance, and its small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically covered in a dense layer of hair. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is part of the broader Eucalyptus blakelyi species group, which includes several other forms with similar ecological and morphological traits.</p>
