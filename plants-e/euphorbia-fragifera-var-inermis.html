                    <h1>Euphorbia fragifera var. inermis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fragifera var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments.</p>
