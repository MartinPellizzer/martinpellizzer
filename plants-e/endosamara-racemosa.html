                    <h1>Endosamara racemosa</h1>
<p>Endosamara racemosa, commonly known as the clustered endosperm tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into distinctive endospermous fruits. The fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving the detachment of the pericarp. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
