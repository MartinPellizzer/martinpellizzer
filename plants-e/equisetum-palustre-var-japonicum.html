<p>Equisetum palustre var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae, known for its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its slender, jointed stems and lack of true leaves make it a unique and ancient-looking plant.</p>
