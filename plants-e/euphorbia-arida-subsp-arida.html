<p>Euphorbia arida subsp.</p>
<p>arida, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in sandy soils and rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
