                    <h1>Eremostachys leiocalyx</h1>
<p>Eremostachys leiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Eremostachys leiocalyx is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
