                    <h1>Euphorbia mendax</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mendax, commonly known as the false spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in soft, pale greenish-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
