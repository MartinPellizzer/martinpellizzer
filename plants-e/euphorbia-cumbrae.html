<p>Euphorbia cumbrae, commonly known as the Cumbrae spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cumbrae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
