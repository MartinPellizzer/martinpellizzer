                    <h1>Euphorbia szovitsii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, greenish-gray stems covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a slight pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia szovitsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
