                    <h1>Euphorbia bourgeana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bourgeana, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in soft, velvety, greenish-gray leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences containing the true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
