                    <h1>Echinopsilon brachypterus</h1>
<p>Echinopsilon brachypterus, commonly known as the short-winged spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its water-storing tissues and reduced leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of environmental stress.</p>
