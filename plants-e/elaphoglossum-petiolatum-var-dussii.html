                    <h1>Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. dussii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum petiolatum var. dussii, commonly known as the Dussis' water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
