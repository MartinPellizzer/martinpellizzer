                    <h1>Euphorbia lecheoides var. wilsonii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lecheoides var. wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common characteristic among euphorbias.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
