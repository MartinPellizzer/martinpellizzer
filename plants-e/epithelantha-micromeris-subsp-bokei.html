<p>Epithelantha micromeris subsp.</p>
<p>bokei, commonly known as the Mexican firecrown cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the state of Sinaloa in Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem with a greenish-gray color and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color.</p>
