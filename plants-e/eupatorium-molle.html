<p>Eupatorium molle, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its strong scent, which can be unpleasant to some, and it has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
