                    <h1>Epiphyllum strictum</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum strictum, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a type of cactus that grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, nocturnal blooms that are typically pink or white, which attract nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are fleshy and segmented, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the moon cactus does not have a true root system but instead relies on its host for support.</p>
