<p>Eryngium viviparum subsp.</p>
<p>bariegoi, commonly known as the Bariego sea holly, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green leaves and its striking, thistle-like flower heads that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. One of its notable features is its viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
