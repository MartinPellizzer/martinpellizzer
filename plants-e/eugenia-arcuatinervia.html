                    <h1>Eugenia arcuatinervia</h1>
<p>Eugenia arcuatinervia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with prominent, arcuate veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark color, making it a prized material in musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
