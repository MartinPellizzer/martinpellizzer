<p>Eria kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu Orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions at high altitudes, often growing on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and vulnerability to environmental changes, Eria kinabaluensis is considered an important indicator species for the region's biodiversity.</p>
