                    <h1>Ephedra scandens</h1>
<p>Ephedra scandens, commonly known as the climbing ephedra, is a dioecious shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Ephedra scandens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
