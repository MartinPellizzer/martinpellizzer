<p>Eriophyllum mohavense, commonly known as Mohave gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, fuzzy spheres. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sand dunes and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a yellowish color that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
