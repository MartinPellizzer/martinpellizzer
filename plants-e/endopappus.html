                    <h1>Endopappus</h1>
<p>Endopappus, commonly known as a type of pappus found in certain flowering plants, is a specialized structure that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is typically composed of modified bracts or hairs that are attached internally to the seed coat. This structure is most commonly observed in the Asteraceae family, such as daisies and sunflowers. The endopappus helps the seed remain attached to the plant until it is ready to be dispersed by wind, water, or animals.</p>
<p>Its presence and morphology can vary among species, influencing the plant's reproductive strategy.</p>
