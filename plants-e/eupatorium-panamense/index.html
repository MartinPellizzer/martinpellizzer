                            <h1>Eupatorium Panamense</h1>
<p>Eupatorium panamense is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Central America. This plant is known for its vibrant purple and white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical woodlands and stream banks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively underappreciated in the broader horticultural community.</p>
