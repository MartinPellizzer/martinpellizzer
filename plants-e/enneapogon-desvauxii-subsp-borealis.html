<p>Enneapogon desvauxii subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, sand dunes, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
