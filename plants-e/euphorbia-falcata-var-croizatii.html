                    <h1>Euphorbia falcata var. croizatii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia falcata var. croizatii, commonly known as the Croizatâ€™s euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help deter herbivores and minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
