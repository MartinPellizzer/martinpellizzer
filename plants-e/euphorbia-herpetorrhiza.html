                    <h1>Euphorbia herpetorrhiza</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herpetorrhiza, commonly known as the snake-root euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
