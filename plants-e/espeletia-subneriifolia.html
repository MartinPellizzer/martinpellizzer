                    <h1>Espeletia subneriifolia</h1>
<p>Espeletia subneriifolia, commonly known as the Colombian pineapple plant, is a rosette-forming shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the center of its rosette, which is typically yellow or orange in color. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in p√°ramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
