                    <h1>Eupatorium pedale</h1>
<p>Eupatorium pedale, commonly known as white snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a strong, sometimes disagreeable odor. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in folk medicine, though its toxicity has made it less common in modern herbal practices.</p>
