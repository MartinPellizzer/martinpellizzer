<p>Echinocereus santaritensis subsp.</p>
<p>santaritensis, commonly known as the Santa Rita hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with dense, spiny stems that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
