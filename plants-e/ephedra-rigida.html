                    <h1>Ephedra rigida</h1>
<p>Ephedra rigida, commonly known as the rigid ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Ephedra rigida is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its stems and having a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to its classification as a controlled substance in many countries due to its active alkaloid content.</p>
