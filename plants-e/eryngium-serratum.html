                    <h1>Eryngium serratum</h1>
<p>Eryngium serratum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features spiky, blue to purple flower heads surrounded by bristly, silver-green bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has finely serrated leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in dunes or rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>Eryngium serratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
