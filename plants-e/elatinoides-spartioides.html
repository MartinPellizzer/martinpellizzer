                    <h1>Elatinoides spartioides</h1>
<p>Elatinoides spartioides, commonly known as the sandbur or seaside sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Elatinoides spartioides is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
