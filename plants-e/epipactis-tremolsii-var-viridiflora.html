                    <h1>Epipactis tremolsii var. viridiflora</h1>
<p>Epipactis tremolsii var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and its unique, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a complex life cycle, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
