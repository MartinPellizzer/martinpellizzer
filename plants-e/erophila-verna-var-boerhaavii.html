                    <h1>Erophila verna var. boerhaavii</h1>
<p>Erophila verna var. boerhaavii, commonly known as the early cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It blooms early in the spring, producing clusters of yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Erophila verna.</p>
