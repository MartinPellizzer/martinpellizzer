                    <h1>Elizabetha leiogyne</h1>
<p>Elizabetha leiogyne, commonly known as the broadleaf waterhyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable resource for water purification and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
