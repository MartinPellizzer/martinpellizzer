<p>Equisetum limosum f. virgatum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a variety of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
