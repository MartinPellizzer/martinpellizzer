                    <h1>Euphorbia coriacea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a waxy, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
