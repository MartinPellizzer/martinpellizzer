                    <h1>Erica genistifolia</h1>
<p>Erica genistifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath or dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Erica genistifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
