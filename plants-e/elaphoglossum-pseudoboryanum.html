<p>Elaphoglossum pseudoboryanum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum pseudoboryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
