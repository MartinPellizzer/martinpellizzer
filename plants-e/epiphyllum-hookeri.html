                    <h1>Epiphyllum hookeri</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum hookeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a fascinating epiphytic cactus native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours before closing, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Epiphyllum hookeri is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
