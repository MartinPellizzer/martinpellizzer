                    <h1>Erythrina chacoensis</h1>
<p>Erythrina chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red floral bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated seed pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Erythrina chacoensis is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in savannas and dry forests.</p>
