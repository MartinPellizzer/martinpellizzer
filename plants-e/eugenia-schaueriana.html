<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often red or yellow when ripe. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes.</p>
