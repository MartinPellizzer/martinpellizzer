<p>Elaphoglossum fayorum, commonly known as the Cayman Islands holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns, and it produces sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
