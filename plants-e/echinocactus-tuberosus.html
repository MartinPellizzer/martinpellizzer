                    <h1>Echinocactus tuberosus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus tuberosus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its spiny, cylindrical stems provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus tuberosus is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
