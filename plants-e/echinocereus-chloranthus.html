<p>Echinocereus chloranthus, commonly known as the green flowering cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Echinocereus chloranthus is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
