                    <h1>Echinocactus simpsonii f. minor</h1>
<p>Echinocactus simpsonii f. minor, commonly known as the Simpson's Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which give it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
