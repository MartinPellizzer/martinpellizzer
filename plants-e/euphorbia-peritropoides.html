                    <h1>Euphorbia peritropoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia peritropoides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically small, dark green, and sometimes covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
