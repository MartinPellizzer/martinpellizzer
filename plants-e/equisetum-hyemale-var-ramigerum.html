                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. ramigerum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. ramigerum, commonly known as the creeping or variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its branching pattern, which differs from the more commonly known Equisetum hyemale.</p>
