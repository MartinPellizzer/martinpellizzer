The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
