<p>Euphorbia potosina, commonly known as the Potosi spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several feet in height, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures that house the reproductive parts.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to store water in its stems and leaves, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
