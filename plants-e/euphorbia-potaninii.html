                    <h1>Euphorbia potaninii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
