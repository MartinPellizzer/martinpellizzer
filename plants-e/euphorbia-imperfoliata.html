                    <h1>Euphorbia imperfoliata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia imperfoliata, commonly known as the leafless spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and the absence of true leaves, which are replaced by modified structures called phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. Euphorbia imperfoliata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
