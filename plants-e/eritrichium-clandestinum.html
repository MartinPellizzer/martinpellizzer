                    <h1>Eritrichium clandestinum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium clandestinum, commonly known as the "penny pincher," is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, hairy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
