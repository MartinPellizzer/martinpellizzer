<p>Eriocaulon dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist environments effectively.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon dalzellii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
