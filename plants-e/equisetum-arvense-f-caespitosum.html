                    <h1>Equisetum arvense f. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense f. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stiff, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, often disturbed soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring. It is a perennial plant that can spread through both spores and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
