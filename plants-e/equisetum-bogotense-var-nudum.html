                    <h1>Equisetum bogotense var. nudum</h1>
<p>Equisetum bogotense var. nudum, commonly known as the naked scouring rush, is a rare and specialized fern-like plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes ancient vascular plants with a long evolutionary history. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures rather than true leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and boggy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
