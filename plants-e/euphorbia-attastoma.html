                    <h1>Euphorbia attastoma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia attastoma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia attastoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
