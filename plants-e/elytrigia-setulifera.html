<p>Elytrigia setulifera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
