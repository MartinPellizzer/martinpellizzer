                    <h1>Euphorbia vahlii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vahlii, commonly known as the Vahli's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, rounded stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be reduced or absent in some varieties.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vahlii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
