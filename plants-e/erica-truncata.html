<p>Erica truncata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in spring. Erica truncata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness.</p>
