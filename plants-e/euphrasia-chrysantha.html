                    <h1>Euphrasia chrysantha</h1>
<p>Euphrasia chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow eyebright, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent yellow markings that resemble eyes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched.</p>
<p>Euphrasia chrysantha is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though its botanical significance lies in its role as a wildflower in its native ecosystems.</p>
