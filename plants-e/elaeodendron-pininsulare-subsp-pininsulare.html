<p>Elaeodendron pininsulare subsp.</p>
<p>pininsulare, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves and its tall, slender trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, adapting well to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
