                    <h1>Euphorbia porteriana var. scoparia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia porteriana var. scoparia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
