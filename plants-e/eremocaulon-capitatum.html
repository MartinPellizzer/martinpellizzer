<p>Eremocaulon capitatum, commonly known as the mountain snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremocaulon capitatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
