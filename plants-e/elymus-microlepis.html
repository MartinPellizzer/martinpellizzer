<p>Elymus microlepis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Elymus microlepis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
