                    <h1>Espeletia frailejonota</h1>
<p>Espeletia frailejonota, commonly known as the frailejonota, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to cold, high-altitude environments include a thick, insulating layer of hairs on its leaves.</p>
<p>Espeletia frailejonota is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
