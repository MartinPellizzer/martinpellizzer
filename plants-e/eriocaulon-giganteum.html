                    <h1>Eriocaulon giganteum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon giganteum, commonly known as the giant spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>The small, white flowers are clustered in spike-like structures, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens.</p>
