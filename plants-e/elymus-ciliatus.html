                    <h1>Elymus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Elymus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Elymus ciliatus is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
