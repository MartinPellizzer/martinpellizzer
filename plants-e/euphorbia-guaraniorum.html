                    <h1>Euphorbia guaraniorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia guaraniorum, commonly known as the Guaran√≠ spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts, which are not actually petals but modified leaves.</p>
<p>Its latex, like that of other euphorbias, contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
