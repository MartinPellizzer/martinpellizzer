<p>Elisma natans f. sparganiifolium, commonly known as the floating leaf buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its floating leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a spiky inflorescence, which gives it the "sparganiifolium" designation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
