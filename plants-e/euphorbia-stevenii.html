<p>Euphorbia stevenii, commonly known as Steven's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several feet in height, often with a branching structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, and they may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia stevenii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
