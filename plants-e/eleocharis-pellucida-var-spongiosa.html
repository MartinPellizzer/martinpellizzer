                    <h1>Eleocharis pellucida var. spongiosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis pellucida var. spongiosa, commonly known as the spongegrass, is a species of sedge characterized by its dense, spongy inflorescence.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters. Its unique structure allows it to float on the water's surface, aiding in its dispersal and survival in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
