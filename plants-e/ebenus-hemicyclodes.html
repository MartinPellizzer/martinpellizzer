<p>Ebenus hemicyclodes, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Ebenus hemicyclodes is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
