<p>Ephedra likiangensis f. mairei, commonly known as the Yunnan ephedra, is a subspecies of the ephedra plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its jointed, woody stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to the presence of ephedrine.</p>
