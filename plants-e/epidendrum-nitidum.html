                    <h1>Epidendrum nitidum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum nitidum, commonly known as the bright leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum nitidum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
