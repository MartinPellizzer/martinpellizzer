                    <h1>Elvasia caurensis</h1>
<p>Elvasia caurensis, commonly known as the Caurian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the limestone-rich regions of the Cauria Mountains in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow crevices and rocky outcrops, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a combination of white and purple hues. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption from the mineral-rich soil, and it has a short flowering period during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elvasia caurensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
