<p>Euphorbia decaryi var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is characterized by its ability to form dense clumps.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
