                    <h1>Euphorbia hooveri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a short, branching stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellowish-green花朵, which are actually modified structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
