<p>Echium megalanthum, commonly known as the giant blueweed, is a striking annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, adorned with clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echium megalanthum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
