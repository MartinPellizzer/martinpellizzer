                    <h1>Euonymus</h1>
<p>Euonymus, commonly known as woodbine or evergreen spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Celastraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. Many species of Euonymus are shrubs or small trees, with some having persistent, waxy leaves that remain throughout the year. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Euonymus species are also used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and their tolerance to pruning.</p>
