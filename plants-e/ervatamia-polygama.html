                    <h1>Ervatamia polygama</h1>
<p>Ervatamia polygama, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and washes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its adaptations include a deep root system for water absorption and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Ervatamia polygama plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
