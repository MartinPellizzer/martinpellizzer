                    <h1>Eragrostis platyphylla</h1>
<p>Eragrostis platyphylla, commonly known as broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>It is often found in prairies, woodlands, and disturbed sites, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat.</p>
