                    <h1>Eugenia plumieri</h1>
<p>Eugenia plumieri, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and filters water, making it ecologically significant in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eugenia plumieri thrives in brackish water and is highly tolerant of salt and tidal fluctuations.</p>
