<p>Equisetum giganteum var. poeppigianum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, segmented stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are arranged in whorls. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>This ancient plant is notable for its lack of true leaves and its primitive vascular system.</p>
