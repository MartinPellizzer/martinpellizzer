                    <h1>Eriogonum nudum var. deductum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum nudum var. deductum, commonly known as the Desert Buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem.</p>
