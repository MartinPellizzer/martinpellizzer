                    <h1>Ephemerantha stenoglossa</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ephemera, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the rainy season. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Its blooming period is short-lived, making it a challenging species to study and cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
