<p>Eleutherococcus xizangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan eleuthero, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
