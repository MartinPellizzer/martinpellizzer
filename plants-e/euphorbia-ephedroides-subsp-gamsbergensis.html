<p>Euphorbia ephedroides subsp.</p>
<p>gamsbergensis, commonly known as the Gamsberg euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soils and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
