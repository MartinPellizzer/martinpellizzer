                    <h1>Ecbolium lithospermifolium</h1>
<p>Ecbolium lithospermifolium, commonly known as the rock-ferns or stone-leaf fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and clustered, with a structure that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its reproductive system involves spore production, typical of ferns, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
