<p>Escobariopsis prolifera subsp.</p>
<p>texana, commonly known as the Texas scaly broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its dense, scaly, reddish-brown stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Texas, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species.</p>
