<p>Euphorbia inaequilatera var. spanothrix, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
