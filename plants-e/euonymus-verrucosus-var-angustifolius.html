                    <h1>Euonymus verrucosus var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Euonymus verrucosus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, inflated capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique seed structures.</p>
