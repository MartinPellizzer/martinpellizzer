                    <h1>Eucalyptus grandis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus grandis, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a tall, fast-growing evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from white to grey, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and strong, making it valuable for timber and paper production.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus grandis is also widely cultivated for its essential oils, which have medicinal and industrial applications.</p>
