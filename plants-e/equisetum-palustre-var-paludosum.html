                    <h1>Equisetum palustre var. paludosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre var. paludosum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead having sterile and fertile stems that produce spores. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, thriving in acidic soils and moist conditions. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, with a morphology that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.</p>
