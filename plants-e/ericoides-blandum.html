                    <h1>Ericoides blandum</h1>
<p>Ericoides blandum, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed, forming a mat-like structure that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Ericoides blandum is a key component of coastal heath ecosystems and is often found in association with other Ericaceae species.</p>
