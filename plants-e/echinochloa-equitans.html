                    <h1>Echinochloa equitans</h1>
<p>Echinochloa equitans, commonly known as barnyard grass, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent midribs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can significantly impact crop yields if left uncontrolled.</p>
