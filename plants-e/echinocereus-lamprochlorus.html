<p>Echinocereus lamprochlorus, commonly known as the pale green cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green to blue-gray stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in desert gardens.</p>
