<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp.</p>
<p>stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with opposite, narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
