                    <h1>Echinocactus grahlianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus grahlianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that is covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky appearance. It is a slow-growing succulent that stores water in its fleshy stem, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections.</p>
