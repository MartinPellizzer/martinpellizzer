<p>Eragrostis pubescens, commonly known as hairy lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Eragrostis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
