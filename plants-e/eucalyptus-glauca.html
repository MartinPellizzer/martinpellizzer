                    <h1>Eucalyptus glauca</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus glauca, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white to grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps distinguish it from other eucalyptus species. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
