                    <h1>Echinocactus lamellosus var. fulvescens</h1>
<p>Echinocactus lamellosus var. fulvescens, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a distinctive cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
