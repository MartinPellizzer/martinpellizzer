<p>Silver heath, scientifically known as Eriochilus sericeus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive and elegant appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its delicate flowers, often in shades of pink or white, bloom in spring, adding a touch of color to the landscape. Despite its hardy nature, Silver heath requires careful attention to watering and soil conditions to flourish.</p>
