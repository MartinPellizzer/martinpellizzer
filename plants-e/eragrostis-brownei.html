<p>Eragrostis brownei, commonly known as Brown's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, tufted spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
