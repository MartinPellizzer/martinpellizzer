                    <h1>Euphorbia lorifolia var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lorifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
