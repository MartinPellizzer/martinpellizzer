<p>Eleocharis appendiculata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers.
