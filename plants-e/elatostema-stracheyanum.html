<p>Elatostema stracheyanum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are characterized by their elliptical shape and a distinctive silvery sheen, which gives it its common name.</p>
