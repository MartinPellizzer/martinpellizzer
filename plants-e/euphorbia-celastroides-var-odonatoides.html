                    <h1>Euphorbia celastroides var. odonatoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia celastroides var. odonatoides, commonly known as the golden crown or crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem with a crown of fleshy, spiny leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, its milky sap can be irritating to the skin, so handling requires caution.</p>
