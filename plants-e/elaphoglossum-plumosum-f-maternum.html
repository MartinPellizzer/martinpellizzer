<p>Elaphoglossum plumosum f. maternum, commonly known as the maternal form of the silky holly fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, slender, and often arching fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released through a unique, shield-like cover.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
