                    <h1>Eleocharis truncata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis truncata, commonly known as the spike rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Eleocharis truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife.</p>
