<p>Euphorbia carniolica subsp.</p>
<p>expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, sprawling stem covered in soft, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it can be toxic if ingested and may cause skin irritation.</p>
