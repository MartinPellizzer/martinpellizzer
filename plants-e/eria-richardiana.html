<p>Eria richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, and the plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Eria richardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
