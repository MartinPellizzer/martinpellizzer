                <h1>Erica radicans</h1>
<p>Erica radicans, commonly known as the trailing heath or evergreen heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica radicans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
