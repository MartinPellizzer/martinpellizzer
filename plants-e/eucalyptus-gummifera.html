                <h1>Eucalyptus gummifera</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or honey gum, is a tall, erect tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey to white bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus gummifera is known for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>
