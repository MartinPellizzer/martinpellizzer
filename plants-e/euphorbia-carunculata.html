<p>Euphorbia carunculata, commonly known as the prickly pear or candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of a red, waxy structure called a caruncle at the base of each flower.</p>
<p>Euphorbia carunculata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
