                            <h1>Epilobium Alpinum Var. Gracillimum</h1>
<p>Epilobium alpinum var. gracillimum is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is known for its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. This variant of Epilobium alpinum is distinguished by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
