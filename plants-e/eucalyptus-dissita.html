                    <h1>Eucalyptus dissita</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus dissita, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically flowering in spring. Its timber is valued for its strength and durability, and it is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic oils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus dissita thrives in cooler, wetter climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
