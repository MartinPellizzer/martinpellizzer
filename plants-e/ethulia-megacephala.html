<p>Ethulia megacephala, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enormous, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are large and showy, typically appearing in a striking white or pink hue, and they emit a strong, sweet fragrance. Ethulia megacephala thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense floating mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a keystone species in its ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
