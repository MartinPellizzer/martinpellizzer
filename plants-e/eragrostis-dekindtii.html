<p>Eragrostis dekindtii, commonly known as the De Kindt's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Eragrostis dekindtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
