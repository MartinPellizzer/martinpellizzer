                    <h1>Excoecaria diandra</h1>
<p>Excoecaria diandra, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Excoecaria diandra plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
