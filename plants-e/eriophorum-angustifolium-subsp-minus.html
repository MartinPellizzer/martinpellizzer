<p>Eriophorum angustifolium subsp.</p>
<p>minus, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Eriophorum angustifolium.</p>
