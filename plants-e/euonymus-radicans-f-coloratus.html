                    <h1>Euonymus radicans f. coloratus</h1>
<p>Euonymus radicans f. coloratus, commonly known as the red-veined ivy, is a compact, trailing plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking red veins that contrast vividly against the foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant leaf coloration and year-round visual interest.</p>
