                    <h1>Eremogone lychnidea</h1>
<p>Eremogone lychnidea, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Eremogone lychnidea exhibits drought tolerance and is often found in rocky soils and crevices.</p>
