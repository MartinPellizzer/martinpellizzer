<p>Eschweilera retusa, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, red-orange flowers that attract various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered.</p>
