                    <h1>Euphorbia nocens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nocens, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a unique, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a spiny, otherworldly appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nocens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
