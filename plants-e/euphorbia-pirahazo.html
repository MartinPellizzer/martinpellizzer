                    <h1>Euphorbia pirahazo</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pirahazo, commonly known as the Pirahazo spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
