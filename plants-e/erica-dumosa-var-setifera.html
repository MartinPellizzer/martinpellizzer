<p>Erica dumosa var. setifera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
