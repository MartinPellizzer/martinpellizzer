<p>Equisetum limosum subsp.</p>
<p>fluviatile, commonly known as water horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically bright green and covered with small spore-producing structures called strobila.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
