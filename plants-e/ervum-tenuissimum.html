                    <h1>Ervum tenuissimum</h1>
<p>Ervum tenuissimum, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
