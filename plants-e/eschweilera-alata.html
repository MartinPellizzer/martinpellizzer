<p>Eschweilera alata, commonly known as the white-veined sycamore, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lecythidaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. The tree produces distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds.
