                    <h1>Erica pubescens var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Erica pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Erica pubescens var. pubescens is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
