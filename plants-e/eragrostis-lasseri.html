                    <h1>Eragrostis lasseri</h1>
<p>Eragrostis lasseri, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
