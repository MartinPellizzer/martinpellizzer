<p>Epidendrum campos-portoi, commonly known as the Campos-Portoi orchid, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short and thick, supporting the plant's structure and storing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
