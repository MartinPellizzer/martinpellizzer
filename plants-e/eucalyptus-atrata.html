                    <h1>Eucalyptus atrata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus atrata, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that often appears almost black, and its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing small, brown seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus atrata is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
