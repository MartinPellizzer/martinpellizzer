                    <h1>Echinopsis aurea var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Echinopsis aurea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered moon cactus, is a striking cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, globular stem with a dense covering of white spines, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is a hybrid and not a naturally occurring species in the wild.</p>
