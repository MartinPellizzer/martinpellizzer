<p>Elaphoglossum hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid holly fern, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that are typically bright green and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
