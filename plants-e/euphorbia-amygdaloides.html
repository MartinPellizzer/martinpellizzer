<p>Euphorbia amygdaloides, commonly known as the amygdaloid spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are distinctive structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
