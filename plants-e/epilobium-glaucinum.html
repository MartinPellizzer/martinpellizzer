<p>Epilobium glaucinum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Epilobium glaucinum is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
