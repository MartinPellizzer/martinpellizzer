                    <h1>Euphorbia ephedroides var. debilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ephedroides var. debilis, commonly known as the weak euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, branched structure with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
