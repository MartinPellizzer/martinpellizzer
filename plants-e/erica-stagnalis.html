                    <h1>Erica stagnalis</h1>
<p>Erica stagnalis, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet, acidic environments of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where its deep root system helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming from April to June. Its leaves are leathery and dense, contributing to the plant's ability to retain moisture in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Erica stagnalis plays an important ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species in its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
