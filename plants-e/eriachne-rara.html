                    <h1>Eriachne rara</h1>
<p>Eriachne rara, commonly known as the rare spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute grains. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its narrow leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eriachne rara plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
