<p>Eragrostis kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kiwuensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
