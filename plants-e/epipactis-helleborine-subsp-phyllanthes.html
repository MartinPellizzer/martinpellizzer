<p>Epipactis helleborine subsp.</p>
<p>phyllanthes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple spots.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. It is a myco-heterotrophic species, meaning it relies on fungal associations for part of its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves the production of small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind and animal activity.</p>
