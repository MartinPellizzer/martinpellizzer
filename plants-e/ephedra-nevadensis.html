                    <h1>Ephedra nevadensis</h1>
<p>Ephedra nevadensis, commonly known as the Great Basin ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in rocky soils and sagebrush steppe habitats. Ephedra nevadensis is part of the Ephedraceae family, which is closely related to the gymnosperms.</p>
<p>It has historical significance in traditional medicine but is now primarily of interest for ecological and botanical study.</p>
