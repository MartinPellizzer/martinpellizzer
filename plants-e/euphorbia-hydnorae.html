<p>Euphorbia hydnorae, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a unique and striking plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a corpse, hence its common name. The plant is a succulent, adapted to thrive in arid environments with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies, which are attracted by its strong, decaying odor.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hydnorae is also notable for its lack of leaves, relying solely on its stem for photosynthesis.</p>
