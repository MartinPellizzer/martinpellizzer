                    <h1>Erythraea paposana</h1>
<p>Erythraea paposana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
