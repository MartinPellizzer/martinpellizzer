<p>Elasmatium, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Elatinaceae.</p>
<p>These small, leafy plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Elasmatium species are characterized by their delicate, thread-like stems and small, closely packed leaves.
