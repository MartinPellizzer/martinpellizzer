                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. polystachion</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. polystachion, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and its distinctive, hollow, jointed stems. This variety is typically found in wet, marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
