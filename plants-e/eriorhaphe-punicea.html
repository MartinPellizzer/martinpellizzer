                    <h1>Eriorhaphe punicea</h1>
<p>Eriorhaphe punicea, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, reddish leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eriorhaphe punicea is well adapted to poor, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
