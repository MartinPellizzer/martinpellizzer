                    <h1>Eragrostis saxatilis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis saxatilis, commonly known as the rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and rocky environments in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis saxatilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas.</p>
