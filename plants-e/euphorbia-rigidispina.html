                    <h1>Euphorbia rigidispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rigidispina, commonly known as the rigid spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
