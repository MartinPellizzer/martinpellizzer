                    <h1>Euphorbia anacampseroides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia anacampseroides, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with gray-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
