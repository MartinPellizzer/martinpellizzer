                    <h1>Excremis ramosa</h1>
<p>Excremis ramosa, commonly known as the branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Excremis ramosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
