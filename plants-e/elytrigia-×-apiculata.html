                    <h1>Elytrigia × apiculata</h1>
<p>Elytrigia × apiculata, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia calycina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
