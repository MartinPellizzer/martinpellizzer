                    <h1>Erythrodes stigmatoptera</h1>
<p>Erythrodes stigmatoptera, commonly known as the red-stigma orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and yellow floral structures, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers exhibit a unique structure with a prominent stigmatic region that aids in pollen transfer.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to its ecological niche and pollination strategy.</p>
