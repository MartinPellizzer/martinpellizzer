<p>Edraianthus serbicus subsp.</p>
<p>stankovicii, commonly known as the StankoviÄ‡'s edraianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its preference for rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
