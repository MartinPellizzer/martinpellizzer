<p>It features small, green, oval-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
