                    <h1>Erlangea duemmeri</h1>
<p>Erlangea duemmeri, commonly known as the Duemmer's erlang, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erlangea duemmeri is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments.</p>
