                    <h1>Exhalimolobos weddellii</h1>
<p>Exhalimolobos weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions. Its growth is slow, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
