<p>Epidendrum affine, commonly known as the common epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, often branching growth habit and its relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red hues. Epidendrum affine is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
