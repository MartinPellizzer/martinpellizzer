                    <h1>Euphorbia pamirica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
