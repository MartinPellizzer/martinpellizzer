                    <h1>Enicosanthellum plagioneurum</h1>
<p>Enicosanthellum plagioneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the trunks and branches of trees, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
