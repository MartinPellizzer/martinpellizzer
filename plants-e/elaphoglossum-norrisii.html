                    <h1>Elaphoglossum norrisii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum norrisii, commonly known as the Norris's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or humus-rich soil, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum norrisii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
