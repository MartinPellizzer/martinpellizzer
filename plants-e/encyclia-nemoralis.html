<p>Encyclia nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Encyclia nemoralis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
