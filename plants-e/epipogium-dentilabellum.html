                    <h1>Epipogium dentilabellum</h1>
<p>Epipogium dentilabellum, commonly known as the toothed hooded orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for nutrition. The plant produces a single, hooded flower with a distinctive, toothed lip that gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal networks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
