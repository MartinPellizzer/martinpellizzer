<p>Eriocaulon heteropeplon, commonly known as the woolly spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized aquatic or wetland habitat.</p>
<p>It features a dense, tufted growth of narrow, grass-like leaves, with the inflorescence consisting of a spike-like cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is distinguished by its hairy or scaly nodes along the stems, which contribute to its common name. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and pond margins.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of aquatic plant communities.</p>
