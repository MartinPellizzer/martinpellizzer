<p>Eragrostis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to the United States, particularly in the central and eastern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to reddish, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Eragrostis stenophylla is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
