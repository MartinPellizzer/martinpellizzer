<p>Euphorbia xylopoda, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered in a layer of white, powdery sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often shed during dry periods, allowing the plant to conserve water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia xylopoda is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
