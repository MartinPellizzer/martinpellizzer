                    <h1>Epidendrum strobiloides</h1>
<p>Epidendrum strobiloides, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, pineapple-shaped inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, typical of many orchids.</p>
<p>Epidendrum strobiloides is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
