<p>Eragrostis linozodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis linozodes is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
