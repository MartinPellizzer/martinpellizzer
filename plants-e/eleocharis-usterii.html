                    <h1>Eleocharis usterii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis usterii, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of marsh and swamp ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis usterii plays a role in providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
