<p>Eriogonum elatum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to other varieties of Eriogonum elatum.</p>
