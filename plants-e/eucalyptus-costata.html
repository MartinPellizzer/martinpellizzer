                    <h1>Eucalyptus costata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus costata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus costata is well adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
