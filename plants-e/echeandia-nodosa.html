                    <h1>Echeandia nodosa</h1>
<p>Echeandia nodosa, commonly known as the nodular grass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features dense, compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Echeandia nodosa is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique nodular structure and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
