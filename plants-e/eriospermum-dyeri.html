                    <h1>Eriospermum dyeri</h1>
<p>Eriospermum dyeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Eriospermum dyeri is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
