                    <h1>Euphorbia brevitorta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia brevitorta, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia brevitorta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and resilience.</p>
