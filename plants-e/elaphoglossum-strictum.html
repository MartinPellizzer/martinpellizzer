<p>Elaphoglossum strictum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Elaphoglossum strictum is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
