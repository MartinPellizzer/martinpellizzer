                    <h1>Echites funiformis</h1>
<p>Echites funiformis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echites funiformis is also notable for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating respiratory and skin conditions.</p>
