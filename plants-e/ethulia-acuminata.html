                    <h1>Ethulia acuminata</h1>
<p>Ethulia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
