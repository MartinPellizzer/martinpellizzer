                    <h1>Euphorbia exigua var. truncata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exigua var. truncata, commonly known as the Mexican spurge or dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care.</p>
