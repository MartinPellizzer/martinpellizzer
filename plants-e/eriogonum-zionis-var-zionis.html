                    <h1>Eriogonum zionis var. zionis</h1>
<p>Eriogonum zionis var. zionis, commonly known as Zion's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in Utah and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray appearance, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range.</p>
