                    <h1>Epithymum cuscutoides</h1>
<p>Epithymum cuscutoides, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around host plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle is short, with rapid growth and reproduction, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken host plants and is sometimes considered a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
