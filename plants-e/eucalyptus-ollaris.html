<p>Eucalyptus ollaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels off in strips, revealing a smooth, greyish underbark.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus ollaris is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
