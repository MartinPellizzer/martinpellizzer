                    <h1>Elaphoglossum ayopayense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum ayopayense, commonly known as the Ayopay√°n holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brownish hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum ayopayense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
