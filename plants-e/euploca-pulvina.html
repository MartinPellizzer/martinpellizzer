                    <h1>Euploca pulvina</h1>
<p>Euploca pulvina, commonly known as the cushion euploca, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves are covered in a fine layer of hairs, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euploca pulvina is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
