                    <h1>Espeletia oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Espeletia oppositifolia, commonly known as the "Páramo sunflower," is a striking plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, rosette-like structure with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the high-altitude, cold environment.</p>
<p>Espeletia oppositifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
