<p>Euphorbia emirnensis var. imbricata, commonly known as the Imbricata Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features a short, upright stem with dense clusters of yellowish-green leaves that are often arranged in an imbricate (overlapping) pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
