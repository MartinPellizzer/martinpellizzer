                    <h1>Eucalyptus calophylla</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus calophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry conditions. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus calophylla is adapted to frequent fires, with lignotubers allowing it to resprout after disturbances.</p>
