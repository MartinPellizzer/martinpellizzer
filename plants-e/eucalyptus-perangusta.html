                    <h1>Eucalyptus perangusta</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus perangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus perangusta thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its aromatic oils have contributed to its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine and modern herbal remedies.</p>
