                    <h1>Euphorbia heterophylla var. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heterophylla var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
