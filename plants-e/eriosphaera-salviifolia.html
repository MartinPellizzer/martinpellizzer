<p>Eriosphaera salviifolia, commonly known as the Salvia-leaved eriosphaera, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
