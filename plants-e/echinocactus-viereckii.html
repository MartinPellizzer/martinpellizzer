<p>Echinocactus viereckii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and desert gardens.</p>
