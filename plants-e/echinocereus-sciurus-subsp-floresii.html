                    <h1>Echinocereus sciurus subsp. floresii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus sciurus subsp.</p>
<p>floresii, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is reduced to spines, and it has a dense, compact growth habit that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
