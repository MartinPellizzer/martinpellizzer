                    <h1>Euphorbia leucophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically white or pale green, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
