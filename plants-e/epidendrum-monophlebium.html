<p>Epidendrum monophlebium, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features long, slender pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
