<p>Eriastrum diffusum subsp.</p>
<p>diffusum, commonly known as the spreading eriastrum, is a low-growing, annual plant native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed sites and its role in stabilizing soil in dry environments.</p>
