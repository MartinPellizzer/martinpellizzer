                    <h1>Erica pilulifera</h1>
<p>Erica pilulifera, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, rounded form and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Erica pilulifera is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
