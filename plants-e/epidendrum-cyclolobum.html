<p>Epidendrum cyclolobum, commonly known as the cyclolobe orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, arching stems with numerous oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Epidendrum cyclolobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
