                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nidiformis</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nidiformis, commonly known as the nest fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, compact fronds that resemble a nest, hence its common name.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic species, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, curled appearance, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
