<p>Eulophia liedenii, commonly known as the Lieden's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a complex structure with specialized roots and a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are often fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eulophia liedenii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
