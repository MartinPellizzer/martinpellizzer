                    <h1>Elaphoglossum isophyllum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum isophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable subject in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
