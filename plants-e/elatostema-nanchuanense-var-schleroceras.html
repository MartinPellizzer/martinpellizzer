<p>Elatostema nanchuanense var. schleroceras, commonly known as the rock elatostema, is a rare variant of the Elatostema genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high elevation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
