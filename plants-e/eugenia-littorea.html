<p>Eugenia littorea, commonly known as the coastal eucalyptus, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale pink or white, followed by edible, fleshy berries.
