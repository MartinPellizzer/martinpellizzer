                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. inundatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. inundatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. This plant is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist soils where it can access the water it requires. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in water-saturated conditions makes it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
