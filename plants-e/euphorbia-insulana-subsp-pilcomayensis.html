<p>Euphorbia insulana subsp.</p>
<p>pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Galápagos spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Galápagos Islands. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Galápagos, including high UV radiation and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
