                    <h1>Euthemis robusta</h1>
<p>Euthemis robusta, commonly known as the robust euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
