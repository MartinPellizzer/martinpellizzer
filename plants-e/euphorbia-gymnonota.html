                    <h1>Euphorbia gymnonota</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gymnonota, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which is a common trait in many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia gymnonota is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
