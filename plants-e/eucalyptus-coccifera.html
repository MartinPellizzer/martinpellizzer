                    <h1>Eucalyptus coccifera</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus coccifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often forming dense thickets in dry, sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and have also been studied for their potential aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
