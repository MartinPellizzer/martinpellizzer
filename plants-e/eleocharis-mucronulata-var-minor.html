                    <h1>Eleocharis mucronulata var. minor</h1>
<p>Eleocharis mucronulata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
