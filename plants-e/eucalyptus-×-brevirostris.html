<p>Eucalyptus × brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-ridged mallee, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled grey and white appearance. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, often forming dense, compact clumps. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue and a rough, felt-like texture.</p>
<p>The narrow-ridged mallee produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
