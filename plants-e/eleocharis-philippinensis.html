<p>Eleocharis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or pale in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis philippinensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
