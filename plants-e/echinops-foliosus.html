<p>Echinops foliosus, commonly known as the leafless globe thistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for a globe, despite its name. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Echinops foliosus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
