                <h1>Eugenia pycnoneura</h1>
<p>Eugenia pycnoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid or coastal habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing in sandy soils along the coastlines of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>Eugenia pycnoneura is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
