<p>Euphorbia berthelotii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and sparse, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble small, cup-like structures. These cyathia contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species.</p>
<p>Euphorbia berthelotii is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
