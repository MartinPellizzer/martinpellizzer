                    <h1>Euphorbia sapiifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sapiifolia, commonly known as the sacred spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its tissues to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
