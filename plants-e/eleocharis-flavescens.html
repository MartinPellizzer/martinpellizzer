<p>Eleocharis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bulbous sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to the health of wetland habitats.</p>
