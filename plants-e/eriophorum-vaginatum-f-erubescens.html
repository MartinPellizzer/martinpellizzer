                    <h1>Eriophorum vaginatum f. erubescens</h1>
<p>Eriophorum vaginatum f. erubescens, commonly known as the red-stalked cotton grass, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red stems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is native to Arctic and alpine regions. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in its harsh environment. Its bright coloration helps it stand out in the tundra, aiding in pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers, typical of the genus Eriophorum.</p>
