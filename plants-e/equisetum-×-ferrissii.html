                    <h1>Equisetum × ferrissii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × ferrissii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of small, spore-producing structures called strobila.</p>
<p>Due to its inability to reproduce sexually, it spreads primarily through vegetative propagation.</p>
