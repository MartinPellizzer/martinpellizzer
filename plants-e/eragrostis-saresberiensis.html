<p>Eragrostis saresberiensis, commonly known as the Saharan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry environments.</p>
