<p>Echinocactus zehntneri, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
