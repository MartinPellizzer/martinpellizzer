                    <h1>Euphorbia polycnemoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polycnemoides, commonly known as the smooth-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, smooth spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling or planting this species.</p>
