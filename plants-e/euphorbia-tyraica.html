<p>Euphorbia tyraica, commonly known as the Syrian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tyraica is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
