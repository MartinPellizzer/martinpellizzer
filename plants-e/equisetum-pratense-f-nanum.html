                    <h1>Equisetum pratense f. nanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum pratense f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf field horsetail, is a compact, low-growing fern-like plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It features whorled arrangements of small, needle-like leaves and retains the ancient characteristics of its ancestors, such as the presence of jointed stems. This fern is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology includes a central stem with nodes and spore-producing structures called strobila.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
