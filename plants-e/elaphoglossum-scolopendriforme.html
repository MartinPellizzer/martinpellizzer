                    <h1>Elaphoglossum scolopendriforme</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum scolopendriforme, commonly known as the snake-like holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum scolopendriforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
