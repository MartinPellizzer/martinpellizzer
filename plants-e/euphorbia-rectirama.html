<p>Euphorbia rectirama, commonly known as the straight-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem that is often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rectirama is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
