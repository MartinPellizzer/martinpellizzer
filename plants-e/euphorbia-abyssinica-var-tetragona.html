                    <h1>Euphorbia abyssinica var. tetragona</h1>
<p>Euphorbia abyssinica var. tetragona, commonly known as the Abyssinian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
