                    <h1>Euphorbia sphaerococca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sphaerococca, commonly known as the globe spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, green, fleshy leaves that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
