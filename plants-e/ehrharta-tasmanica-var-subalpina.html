                    <h1>Ehrharta tasmanica var. subalpina</h1>
<p>Ehrharta tasmanica var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in native grasslands and is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
