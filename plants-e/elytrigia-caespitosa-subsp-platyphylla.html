<p>Elytrigia caespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, forming dense, low-growing tufts.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form clumps.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
