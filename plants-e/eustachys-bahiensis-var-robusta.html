                    <h1>Eustachys bahiensis var. robusta</h1>
<p>Eustachys bahiensis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
