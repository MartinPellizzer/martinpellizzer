<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, spreading stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed coastal soils.</p>
<p>Erodium hesperium is adapted to saline and well-drained environments, making it a common sight along shorelines.</p>
