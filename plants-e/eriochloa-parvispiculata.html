                    <h1>Eriochloa parvispiculata</h1>
<p>Eriochloa parvispiculata, commonly known as small-bristle panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense,丛生 (clumped) foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, bristled lemma hairs, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
