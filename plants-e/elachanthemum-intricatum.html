<p>Elachanthemum intricatum, commonly known as the intricate sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme conditions.</p>
