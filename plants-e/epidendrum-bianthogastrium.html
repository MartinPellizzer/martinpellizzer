                    <h1>Epidendrum bianthogastrium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum bianthogastrium, commonly known as the pink-veined orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking flowers with a combination of pink and white hues, often with contrasting veining. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Epidendrum bianthogastrium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
