<p>Euphorbia emilienneae, commonly known as the Emilienne's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia emilienneae is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
