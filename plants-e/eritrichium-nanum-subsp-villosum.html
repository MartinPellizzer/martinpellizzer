<p>Eritrichium nanum subsp.</p>
<p>villosum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid, or disturbed habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and spoon-shaped, with small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its flowers have four petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
