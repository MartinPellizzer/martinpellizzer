                    <h1>Euphorbia clavigera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia clavigera, commonly known as the spiked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
