                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli f. echinata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli f. echinata, commonly known as spurred barnyardgrass, is a variant of the common barnyardgrass species.</p>
<p>It is a grassy weed characterized by its distinctive spiky, bristly awns that give it its common name. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and competitive nature make it a significant problem in crop production.</p>
