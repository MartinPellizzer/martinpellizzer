                    <h1>Encentrus linearis</h1>
<p>Encentrus linearis, commonly known as the slender tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its linear, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Encentrus linearis is adapted to low water availability and thrives in full sun.</p>
