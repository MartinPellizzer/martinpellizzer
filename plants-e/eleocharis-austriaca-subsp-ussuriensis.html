<p>Eleocharis austriaca subsp.</p>
<p>ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northeastern Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its potential for restoration projects.</p>
