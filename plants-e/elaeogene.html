                    <h1>Elaeogene</h1>
<p>Elaeogene, commonly known as the Eocene epoch, is a geological time period that occurred approximately 56 to 33.9 million years ago.</p>
<p>This era is characterized by a warm global climate that supported a diverse array of plant life, including extensive forests of angiosperms. The botanical landscape was dominated by broad-leaved trees and flowering plants, with many modern plant families beginning to diversify. Fossil evidence from this period provides valuable insights into the evolution of plant species and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Elaeogene also saw the rise of grasses, which would later play a significant role in shaping terrestrial environments.</p>
