<p>Eupatorium oxylepis f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabratum' form is notably smoother than the typical species.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
