<p>Embadium stagnense, commonly known as the swamp embadium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or flooded areas, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Embadium stagnense plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
