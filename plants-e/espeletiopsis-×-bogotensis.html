<p>Espeletiopsis × bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogotá cycad, is a hybrid cycad species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
