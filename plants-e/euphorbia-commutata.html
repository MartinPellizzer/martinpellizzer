                    <h1>Euphorbia commutata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered with soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
