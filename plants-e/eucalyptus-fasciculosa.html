                    <h1>Eucalyptus fasciculosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus fasciculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hairs. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus fasciculosa is an important component of mallee ecosystems and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
