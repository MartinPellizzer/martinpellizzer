                    <h1>Euphorbia agatheae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia agatheae, commonly known as the Agathe's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia agatheae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
