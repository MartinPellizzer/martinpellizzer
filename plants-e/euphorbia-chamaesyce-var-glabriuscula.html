                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, green, fleshy leaves that are usually smooth and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
