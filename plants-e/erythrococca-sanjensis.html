                    <h1>Erythrococca sanjensis</h1>
<p>Erythrococca sanjensis, commonly known as the Sanjensian red cocoon plant, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red, fleshy fruits that encase the seeds, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is notable for its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
