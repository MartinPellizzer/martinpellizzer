                    <h1>Elymus alaicus</h1>
<p>Elymus alaicus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Elymus alaicus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
