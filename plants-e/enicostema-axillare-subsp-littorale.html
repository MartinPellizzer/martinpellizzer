<p>Enicostema axillare subsp.</p>
<p>littorale, commonly known as the coastal panic grass, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to saline and wind-exposed environments, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
