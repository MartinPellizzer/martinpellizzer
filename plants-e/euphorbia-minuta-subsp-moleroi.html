<p>Euphorbia minuta subsp.</p>
<p>moleroi, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent shrub native to parts of Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid climates.</p>
