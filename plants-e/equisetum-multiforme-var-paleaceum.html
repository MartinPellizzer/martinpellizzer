                    <h1>Equisetum multiforme var. paleaceum</h1>
<p>Equisetum multiforme var. paleaceum, commonly known as the pale rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are a distinguishing feature of the genus Equisetum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its ancient appearance and simple morphology reflect its status as one of the oldest groups of vascular plants.</p>
