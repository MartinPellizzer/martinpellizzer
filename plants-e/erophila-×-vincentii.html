                    <h1>Erophila × vincentii</h1>
<p>Erophila × vincentii, commonly known as the hybrid water smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Erophila verna and Erophila hirsute, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in dense, erect spikes.</p>
<p>Erophila × vincentii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
