<p>Eriogonum diatomaceum, commonly known as the diatomaceous eriocephalum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as gravelly slopes and sandy soils. Its scientific name reflects the presence of diatomaceous structures in its floral parts, which are microscopic silica-based organisms.</p>
<p>This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
