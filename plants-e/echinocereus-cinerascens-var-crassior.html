<p>Echinocereus cinerascens var. crassior, commonly known as the thick-stemmed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
