                            <h1>Elaeodendron Aethiopicum</h1>
<p>African mahogany, scientifically known as Elaeodendron aethiopicum, is a tropical tree native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is prized for its durable, heavy, and beautifully grained wood, which has been used for furniture and construction for centuries. Despite its value, the species faces threats from deforestation and overharvesting, leading to its classification as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The tree also plays a crucial role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Conservation efforts are increasingly important to ensure its survival for future generations.</p>
