                    <h1>Echinocactus aureus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus aureus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for succulent collections and rock gardens.</p>
