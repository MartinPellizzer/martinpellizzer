                    <h1>Euphorbia platyphyllos</h1>
<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
