<p>Elymus transhyrcanus var. togarovii, commonly known as the Togarov's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
