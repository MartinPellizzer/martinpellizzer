<p>Eremopyrum patulum, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the amaranth family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its unique shape and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum patulum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
