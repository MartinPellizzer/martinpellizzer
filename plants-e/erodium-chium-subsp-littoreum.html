<p>Erodium chium subsp.</p>
<p>littoreum, commonly known as sea heartweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
