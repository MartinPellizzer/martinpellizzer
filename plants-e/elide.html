                    <h1>Elide</h1>
<p>Elide, commonly known as the eland, is a large antelope native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, long legs, and distinctive lyre-shaped horns. The plant, however, is not a botanical term but refers to an animal. If you were referring to a plant, there may be confusion with the name.</p>
<p>Please clarify if you meant a different species.</p>
