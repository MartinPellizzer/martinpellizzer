                    <h1>Elaphoglossum rockii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum rockii, commonly known as the Rock's holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum rockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
