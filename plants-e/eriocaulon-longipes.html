                    <h1>Eriocaulon longipes</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon longipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
