<p>Elaphoglossum barbae, commonly known as the beard fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
