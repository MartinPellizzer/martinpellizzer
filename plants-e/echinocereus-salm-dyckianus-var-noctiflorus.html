<p>Echinocereus salm-dyckianus var. noctiflorus, commonly known as the night-blooming hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its adaptations make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
