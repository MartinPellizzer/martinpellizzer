                    <h1>Euphorbia barkeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia barkeri, commonly known as Barker's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
