                    <h1>Echinodorus ellipticus var. minus</h1>
<p>Echinodorus ellipticus var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf broadleaf waterweed, is a popular aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Echinodorus ellipticus. This variety thrives in freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. The plant grows in dense clusters and can spread rapidly, making it suitable for background planting in larger tanks.</p>
<p>It prefers moderate to high light levels and is relatively easy to maintain with regular pruning to control its growth.</p>
