<p>Euphorbia fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
