<p>Eriophorum polystachion subsp.</p>
<p>gracile, commonly known as slender cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-white coating that helps reduce water loss in cold environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine organisms.</p>
