<p>Eucladus, commonly known as the European heath, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. They are often found in acidic, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Eucladus species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, a trait common among members of the Ericaceae family.</p>
