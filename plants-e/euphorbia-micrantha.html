<p>Euphorbia micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, typical of many succulents. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually small and alternate along the stems, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia micrantha is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
