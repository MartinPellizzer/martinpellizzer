                    <h1>Euphorbia exigua var. tricuspidata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exigua var. tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves with a distinctive three-lobed shape, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
