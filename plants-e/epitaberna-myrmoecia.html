                    <h1>Epitaberna myrmoecia</h1>
<p>Epitaberna myrmoecia, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species.</p>
<p>Its structure includes a hollow stem that provides shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant also produces nectar-secreting structures that attract ants and other pollinators. Epitaberna myrmoecia is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem, supporting both plant and animal life.</p>
