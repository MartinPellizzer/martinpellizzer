                    <h1>Epilyna muscicola</h1>
<p>Epilyna muscicola, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. It is often found in forest understories and along rocky outcrops in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a valuable indicator species for assessing ecosystem health.</p>
