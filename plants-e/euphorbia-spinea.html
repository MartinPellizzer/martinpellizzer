                    <h1>Euphorbia spinea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinea, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia spinea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental spiny appearance.</p>
