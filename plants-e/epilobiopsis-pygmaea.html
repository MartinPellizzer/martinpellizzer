<p>Epilobiopsis pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Epilobiopsis pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native habitat.</p>
