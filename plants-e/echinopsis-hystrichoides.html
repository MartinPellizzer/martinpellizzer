                    <h1>Echinopsis hystrichoides</h1>
<p>Echinopsis hystrichoides, commonly known as the "Lion's Head" cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and large, spiny, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a dense covering of white bristles, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>Echinopsis hystrichoides is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and surviving long periods of drought.</p>
