                    <h1>Equisetum aquatile</h1>
<p>Equisetum aquatile, commonly known as water horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in wet environments such as marshes, ponds, and streambanks, where it often forms dense colonies. Its reproduction involves the production of spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ancient plant groups.</p>
<p>The plant contains silica, giving it a gritty texture and making it difficult to digest for some herbivores.</p>
