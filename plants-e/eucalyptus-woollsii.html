                    <h1>Eucalyptus woollsii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus woollsii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are released in spring and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus woollsii is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland ecosystems.</p>
