                    <h1>Echinocactus xeranthemoides</h1>
<p>Echinocactus xeranthemoides, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny exterior that protects it from herbivores and excessive water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
