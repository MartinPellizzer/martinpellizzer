                    <h1>Euphorbia thelephora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia thelephora, commonly known as the mountain euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, succulent stems that store water, adapting it to its arid, rocky habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia thelephora is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in rocky, well-drained environments.</p>
