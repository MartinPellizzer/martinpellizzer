                    <h1>Eucalyptus arnhemensis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus arnhemensis, commonly known as the Arnhemland ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a blue-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along river systems.</p>
