                    <h1>Equisetum aquaticum</h1>
<p>Equisetum aquaticum, commonly known as water horsetail, is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense stands. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead possessing microphylls that are reduced in size compared to typical leaves. Its stems are covered in a rough, silica-rich exodermis, which gives it a distinctive gritty texture.</p>
<p>Equisetum aquaticum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
