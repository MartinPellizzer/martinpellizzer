<p>Eunanus breweri, commonly known as the Desert Dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like stems and fuzzy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eunanus breweri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall, showcasing its resilience to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability.</p>
