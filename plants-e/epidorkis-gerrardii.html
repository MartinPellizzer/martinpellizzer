                    <h1>Epidorkis gerrardii</h1>
<p>Epidorkis gerrardii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Epidorkis gerrardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
