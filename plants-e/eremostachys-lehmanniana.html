<p>Eremostachys lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's eremostachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and grayish-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Eremostachys lehmanniana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
