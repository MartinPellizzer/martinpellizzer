<p>Echinocactus longihamatus var. gracilispinus, commonly known as the slender-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that are slender and often curved. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
