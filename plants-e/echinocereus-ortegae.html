The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sunlight, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
