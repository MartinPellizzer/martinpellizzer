                    <h1>Elaphrium elemiferum</h1>
<p>Elaphrium elemiferum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Elaphrium elemiferum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
