<p>Eragrostis pumila, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass native to Eurasia and parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–30 cm, with slender,丛生 stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock.</p>
