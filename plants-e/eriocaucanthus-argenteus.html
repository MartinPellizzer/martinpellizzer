<p>Eriocaucanthus argenteus, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its stems are thick and branched, often growing in a shrub-like form.</p>
<p>Eriocaucanthus argenteus is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
