                    <h1>Euphorbia ceratocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flowers typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its bark is rough and often cracked, and it can grow as a shrub or a tree-like structure.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ceratocarpa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
