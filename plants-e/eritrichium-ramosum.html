<p>Eritrichium ramosum, commonly known as the slender alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Eritrichium ramosum is often found in meadows and slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
