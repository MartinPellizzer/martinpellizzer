                    <h1>Eulophus texanus</h1>
<p>Eulophus texanus, commonly known as the Texas lacewing, is a species of tiny parasitic wasp found primarily in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eulophidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinctive, lace-like wings. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
