                    <h1>Epidendrum stevensii</h1>
<p>Epidendrum stevensii, commonly known as the Stevens' orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are elongated and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum stevensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
