<p>Eriogonum carneum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eriogonum carneum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
