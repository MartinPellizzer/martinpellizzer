<p>Euphorbia hyberna subsp.</p>
<p>euhyberna, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin.</p>
