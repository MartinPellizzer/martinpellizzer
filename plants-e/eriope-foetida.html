                    <h1>Eriope foetida</h1>
<p>Eriope foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine, though they contain harmful alkaloids. Its leaves are hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Eriope foetida is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and thickets.</p>
