<p>Euphorbia australis var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for drought resistance.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
