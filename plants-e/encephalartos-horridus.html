                    <h1>Encephalartos horridus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos horridus, commonly known as the Natal knobbed cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, segmented trunk and its large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos horridus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
