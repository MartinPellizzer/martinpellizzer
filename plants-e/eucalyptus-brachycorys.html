<p>Eucalyptus brachycorys, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are usually pink or red, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus brachycorys thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands.</p>
