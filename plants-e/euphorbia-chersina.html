                    <h1>Euphorbia chersina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chersina, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical, branched stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chersina is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
