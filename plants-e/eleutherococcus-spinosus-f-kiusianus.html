<p>Eleutherococcus spinosus f. kiusianus, commonly known as the Kiusianus eleuthero, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants.</p>
