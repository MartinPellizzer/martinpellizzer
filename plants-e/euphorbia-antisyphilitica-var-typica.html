                    <h1>Euphorbia antisyphilitica var. typica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia antisyphilitica var. typica, commonly known as the Syphilitic Spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and yellowish-green sap. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
