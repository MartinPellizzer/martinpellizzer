                    <h1>Eucalyptus brookeriana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus brookeriana, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to the high-altitude regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale blue, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>This hardy species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments.</p>
