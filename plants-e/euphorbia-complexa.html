                    <h1>Euphorbia complexa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia complexa, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, thorn-like structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia complexa is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
