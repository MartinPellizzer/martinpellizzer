<p>Epilobium pedunculare, commonly known as the common willowherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadside embankments and wet meadows. The plant features erect, branching stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to red flowers with four petals. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Epilobium pedunculare is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
