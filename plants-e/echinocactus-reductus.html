                    <h1>Echinocactus reductus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus reductus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to thrive.</p>
