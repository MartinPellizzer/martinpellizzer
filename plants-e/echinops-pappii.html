                    <h1>Echinops pappii</h1>
<p>Echinops pappii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Echinops pappii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
