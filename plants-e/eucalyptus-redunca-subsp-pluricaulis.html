<p>Eucalyptus redunca subsp.</p>
<p>pluricaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often grey-green in color and have a rough, fibrous texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale blue to cream in color, which bloom during the autumn and winter seasons. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter-colored inner bark.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
