<p>Euphorbia tzitanshaniana, commonly known as the Tzitan Shan spurge, is a rare and striking plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and striking, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces unique, cup-shaped structures called cyathia, which contain small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
