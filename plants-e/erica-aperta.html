                    <h1>Erica aperta</h1>
<p>Erica aperta, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Erica aperta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
