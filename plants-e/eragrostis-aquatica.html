<p>Eragrostis aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers.</p>
