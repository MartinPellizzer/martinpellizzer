                    <h1>Euphorbia renouardii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia renouardii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia renouardii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
