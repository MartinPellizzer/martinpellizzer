                <h1>Ephedra equisetiformis</h1>
<p>Ephedra equisetiformis, commonly known as the creeping ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branching stems that resemble those of horsetails, hence its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures containing minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and often reduced to small, appressed structures.</p>
<p>Ephedra equisetiformis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its stems and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>
