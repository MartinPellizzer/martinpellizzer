<p>Espeletia lopezii subsp.</p>
<p>lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's espeletia, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces inflorescences of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
