                    <h1>Echinops rangei</h1>
<p>Echinops rangei, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape, composed of numerous small, spiny bracts that protect the flowering heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. Echinops rangei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
