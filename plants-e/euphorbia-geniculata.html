                    <h1>Euphorbia geniculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia geniculata is often found in rocky soils and desert environments, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
