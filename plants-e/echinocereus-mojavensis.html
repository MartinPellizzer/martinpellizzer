<p>Echinocereus mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in desert conditions. Its pads, or cladodes, store water and can be used for food or as a source of nectar.</p>
<p>The Mojave prickly pear also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds.</p>
