                    <h1>Echinocitrus</h1>
<p>Echinocitrus, commonly known as the spiny citrus, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that transition into oval, green fruits with a thick, leathery rind. The fruit contains a single large seed and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, Echinocitrus plays a significant role in its native ecosystems.</p>
