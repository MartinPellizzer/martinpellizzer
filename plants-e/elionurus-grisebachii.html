<p>Elionurus grisebachii, commonly known as the gray beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grayish-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically in late summer. Elionurus grisebachii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
