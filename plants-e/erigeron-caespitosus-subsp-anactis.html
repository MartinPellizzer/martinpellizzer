<p>Erigeron caespitosus subsp.</p>
<p>anactis, commonly known as the coastal blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of California. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces numerous ray florets that are typically sterile, with fertile disk florets at the center.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
