                    <h1>Eria dayana</h1>
<p>Eria dayana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Eria dayana thrives in humid, shaded habitats, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by conservationists and botanists.</p>
