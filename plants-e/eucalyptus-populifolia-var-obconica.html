                    <h1>Eucalyptus populifolia var. obconica</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus populifolia var. obconica, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and green. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
