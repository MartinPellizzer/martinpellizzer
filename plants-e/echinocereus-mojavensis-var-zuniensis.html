                    <h1>Echinocereus mojavensis var. zuniensis</h1>
<p>Echinocereus mojavensis var. zuniensis, commonly known as the Zuni cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense clusters of cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its stems are covered in small, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
