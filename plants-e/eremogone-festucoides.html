                    <h1>Eremogone festucoides</h1>
<p>Eremogone festucoides, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eremogone festucoides plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for native wildlife.</p>
