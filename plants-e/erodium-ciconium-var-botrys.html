                    <h1>Erodium ciconium var. botrys</h1>
<p>Erodium ciconium var. botrys, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
