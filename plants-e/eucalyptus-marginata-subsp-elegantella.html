<p>Eucalyptus marginata subsp.</p>
<p>elegantella, commonly known as the elegant mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly curved, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
