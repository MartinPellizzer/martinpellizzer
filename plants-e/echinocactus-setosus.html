<p>Echinocactus setosus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, spiny areoles that bear both flowers and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus setosus is well adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
