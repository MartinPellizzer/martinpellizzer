                    <h1>Euphorbia cupanii var. spartioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cupanii var. spartioides, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
