                    <h1>Euphorbia grandis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia grandis, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Euphorbia grandis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
