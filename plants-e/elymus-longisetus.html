<p>Elymus longisetus, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Elymus longisetus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
