                    <h1>Euphorbia pycnostegia var. pycnostegia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pycnostegia var. pycnostegia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among euphorbias.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
