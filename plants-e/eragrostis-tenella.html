                    <h1>Eragrostis tenella</h1>
<p>Eragrostis tenella, commonly known as slender lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
