<p>Euryops munitus, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which are often mistaken for a single flower. Euryops munitus typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn.</p>
