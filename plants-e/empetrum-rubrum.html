<p>Empetrum rubrum, commonly known as red squill, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Empetrum rubrum plays a key role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh native environment.</p>
