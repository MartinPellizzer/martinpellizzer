<p>Elaphoglossum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum gracillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
