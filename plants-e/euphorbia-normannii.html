                    <h1>Euphorbia normannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia normannii, commonly known as the Normann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates.</p>
