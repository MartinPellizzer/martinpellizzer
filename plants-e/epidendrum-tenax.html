<p>Epidendrum tenax, commonly known as the iron vine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in forest canopies. The plant has long, trailing stems with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Epidendrum tenax is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions.</p>
