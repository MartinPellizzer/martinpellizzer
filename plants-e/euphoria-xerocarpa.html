                    <h1>Euphoria xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphoria xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert euphoria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its fruit is a hard, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
