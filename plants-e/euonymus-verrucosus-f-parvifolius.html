                    <h1>Euonymus verrucosus f. parvifolius</h1>
<p>Euonymus verrucosus f. parvifolius, commonly known as the dwarf euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant is native to eastern Asia and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It has a slow growth rate and is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its dense foliage.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, though it is not typically cultivated for its flowers.</p>
