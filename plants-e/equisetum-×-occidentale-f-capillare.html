<p>Equisetum × occidentale f. capillare, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant retains a primitive morphology, with a central stem that is segmented and covered in rough, silica-rich nodes. Its reproductive structures include strobili, which produce spores, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This fern ally is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
