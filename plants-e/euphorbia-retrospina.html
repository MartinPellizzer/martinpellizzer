                    <h1>Euphorbia retrospina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia retrospina, commonly known as the backward spine euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually spine-tipped and may be reduced or absent in mature plants.</p>
<p>Euphorbia retrospina is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
