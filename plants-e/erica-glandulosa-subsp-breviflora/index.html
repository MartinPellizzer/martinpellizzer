                            <h1>Erica Glandulosa Subsp. Breviflora</h1>
<p>Scotch heather, scientifically known as Erica glandulosa subsp. breviflora, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the rugged coastal regions of Scotland and northern England. This low-growing plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its compact form and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers make it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant is valued for its resilience to harsh weather and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. With its historical significance in folklore and horticulture, Scotch heather remains a beloved symbol of the Scottish landscape.</p>
