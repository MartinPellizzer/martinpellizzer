<p>Epipactis viridans f. remota, commonly known as the green helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a unique inflorescence that bears greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing from a rhizome and producing a single spike of flowers. It is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
