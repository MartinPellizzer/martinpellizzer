                    <h1>Epidendrum amblostomoides</h1>
<p>Epidendrum amblostomoides, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the branches of longleaf pines in the Florida Panhandle. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, showy white or pale green flower that lacks petals. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is highly vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
