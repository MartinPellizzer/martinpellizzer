<p>Epidendrum polyanthum var. myodes, commonly known as the Myodes Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
