<p>Eleocharis depauperata, commonly known as the poor spike-rush, is a small, grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
