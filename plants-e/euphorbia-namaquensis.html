                    <h1>Euphorbia namaquensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia namaquensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat.</p>
