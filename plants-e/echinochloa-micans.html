                    <h1>Echinochloa micans</h1>
<p>Echinochloa micans, commonly known as silky barnyardgrass, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a serious weed in many crops.</p>
