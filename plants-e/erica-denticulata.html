<p>Erica denticulata, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica denticulata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
