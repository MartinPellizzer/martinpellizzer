                    <h1>Euphorbia deltoidea var. serpyllum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia deltoidea var. serpyllum, commonly known as the arrowleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
