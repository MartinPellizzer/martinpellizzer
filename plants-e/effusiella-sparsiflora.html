The plant has slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Effusiella sparsiflora is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
