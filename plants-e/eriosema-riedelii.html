<p>Eriosema riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's eriosema, is a South African plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name "eriosema," derived from the Greek words for "hairy" and "seed.". The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>Eriosema riedelii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
