<p>Echinospartum algibicum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leafless stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Echinospartum algibicum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
