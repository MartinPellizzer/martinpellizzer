                    <h1>Ectasis plukenetii</h1>
<p>Ectasis plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant has a short flowering period, typically blooming only under specific environmental conditions, such as cool temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Ectasis plukenetii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
