<p>Euphorbia distincta, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to spines, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Euphorbia distincta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
