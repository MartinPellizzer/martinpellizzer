<p>Empetrum nigrum var. andinum, commonly known as the Andean crowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark blue berries that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
