<p>Epistylium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-stemmed epistylium, is a colonial calcareous alga found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, bushy colonies that often attach to hard surfaces such as rocks or shells. The plant exhibits a distinctive bluish-green coloration due to its high chlorophyll content. It thrives in shallow, warm waters with moderate light exposure.</p>
<p>Epistylium glaucescens plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
