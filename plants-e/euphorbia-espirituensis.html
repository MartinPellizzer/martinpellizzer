                    <h1>Euphorbia espirituensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia espirituensis, commonly known as the Espiritu Santo euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
