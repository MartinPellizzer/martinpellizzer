                    <h1>Eulophidium sclerophyllum</h1>
<p>Eulophidium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thick, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to surfaces. The plant's vegetative body, or thallus, is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Eulophidium sclerophyllum thrives in dry, rocky environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
