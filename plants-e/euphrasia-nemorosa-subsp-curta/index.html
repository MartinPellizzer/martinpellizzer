                            <h1>Euphrasia Nemorosa Subsp. Curta</h1>
<p>Euphrasia nemorosa subsp. curta is a lesser-known member of the Orobanchaceae family known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle touch of color to the forest floor. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
