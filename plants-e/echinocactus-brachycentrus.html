                    <h1>Echinocactus brachycentrus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus brachycentrus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny, cylindrical stems that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>Echinocactus brachycentrus is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and thriving in full sun.</p>
