<p>Eremaeopsis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting adaptations to survive in harsh, dry environments. Eremaeopsis species are characterized by their rapid growth, climbing habit, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning.
