<p>Espeletia standleyana subsp.</p>
<p>laxior, commonly known as the "Páramo Flower," is a unique plant species native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate strong winds and intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in high-altitude Andean regions.</p>
