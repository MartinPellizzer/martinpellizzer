<p>Eriophyllum staechadifolium var. depressum, commonly known as the lowleaf woollypod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, woolly bracts that cover the flower clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub habitats.</p>
