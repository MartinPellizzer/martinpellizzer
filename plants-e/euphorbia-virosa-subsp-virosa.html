<p>Euphorbia virosa subsp.</p>
<p>virosa, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a spiny shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces toxic latex, containing compounds such as bufotenin and sanguinarine, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>While it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental spines and unique appearance, it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties.</p>
