                    <h1>Elegia parviflora var. rigida</h1>
<p>Elegia parviflora var. rigida, commonly known as rigid dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, semi-evergreen foliage with a dense, mat-forming habit that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
