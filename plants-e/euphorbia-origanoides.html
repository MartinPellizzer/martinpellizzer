                    <h1>Euphorbia origanoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia origanoides, commonly known as the wooly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive appearance with its greyish-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
