                    <h1>Epiphyllanthus candidus</h1>
<p>Epiphyllanthus candidus, commonly known as the white fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives on the surfaces of trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are broad and feathery, with a pale green coloration that helps it blend into its canopy environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
