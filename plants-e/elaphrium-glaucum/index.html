                            <h1>Elaphrium Glaucum</h1>
<p>Elaphrium glaucum is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its striking blue-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and beautiful plant for future generations.</p>
