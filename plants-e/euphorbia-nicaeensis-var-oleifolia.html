                    <h1>Euphorbia nicaeensis var. oleifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nicaeensis var. oleifolia, commonly known as the oleiferous euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
