                    <h1>Edwardsia chrysophylla var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Edwardsia chrysophylla var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved goldenleaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
