<p>Elytrigia juncea subsp.</p>
<p>boreoatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the Atlantic coast. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and dunes.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing dune systems and its resilience to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
