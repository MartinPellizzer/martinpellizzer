                    <h1>Eulophia cernua</h1>
<p>Eulophia cernua, commonly known as the drooping eulophia, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, downward-facing flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Eulophia cernua thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinator populations.</p>
