                    <h1>Eucalyptus exilipes</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus exilipes, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Eucalyptus exilipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
