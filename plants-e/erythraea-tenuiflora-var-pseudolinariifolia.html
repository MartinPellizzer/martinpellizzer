                    <h1>Erythraea tenuiflora var. pseudolinariifolia</h1>
<p>Erythraea tenuiflora var. pseudolinariifolia, commonly known as the narrow-flowered erythraea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are typically linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to E. tenuiflora but differs in its floral structure and leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
