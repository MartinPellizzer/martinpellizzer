<p>Epigynium rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf epigynium, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It possesses a distinctive rounded leaf structure, which is a key identifier in its classification. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
