                    <h1>Euphorbia sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin.</p>
