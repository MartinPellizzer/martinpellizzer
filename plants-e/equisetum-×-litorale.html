                    <h1>Equisetum × litorale</h1>
<p>Equisetum × litorale, commonly known as the sea horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum hyemale and Equisetum palustre.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant features a slender, jointed stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions make it an important species in coastal ecology.</p>
<p>Equisetum × litorale plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
