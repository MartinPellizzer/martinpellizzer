<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos subsp.</p>
<p>platyphyllos, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
