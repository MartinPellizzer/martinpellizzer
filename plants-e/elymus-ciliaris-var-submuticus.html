                    <h1>Elymus ciliaris var. submuticus</h1>
<p>Elymus ciliaris var. submuticus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are densely covered with silky hairs, giving it a soft, grassy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
