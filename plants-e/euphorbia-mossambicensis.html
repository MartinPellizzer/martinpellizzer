<p>Euphorbia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green花朵, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
