                    <h1>Epidendrum acutum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, elongated petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum acutum is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
