<p>Echium bonnetii var. pachycaulon, commonly known as the desert flax, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
