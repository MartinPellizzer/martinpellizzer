                    <h1>Eragrostis viscosa</h1>
<p>Eragrostis viscosa, commonly known as sandblain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Eragrostis viscosa is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and sandy soils, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
