                    <h1>Epidendrum purum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum purum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum purum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
