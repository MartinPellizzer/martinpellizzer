                    <h1>Elymus × jenisseensis</h1>
<p>Elymus × jenisseensis, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
