<p>Euphorbia furcatifolia, commonly known as the forked euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny or warty texture.</p>
<p>Euphorbia furcatifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
