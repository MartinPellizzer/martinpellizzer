                    <h1>Eragrostis setifolia var. dubia</h1>
<p>Eragrostis setifolia var. dubia, commonly known as the slender false wheatgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
