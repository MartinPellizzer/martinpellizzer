<p>Elytrigia alaica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets.</p>
<p>Elytrigia alaica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
