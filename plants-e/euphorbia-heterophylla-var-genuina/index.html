<p>Common milkweed, scientifically known as Euphorbia heterophylla var. genuina, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, lobed leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This species thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various insects and animals.</p>
