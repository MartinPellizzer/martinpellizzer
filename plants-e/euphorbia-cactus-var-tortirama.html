<p>Euphorbia cactus var. tortirama, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cactus var. tortirama is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
