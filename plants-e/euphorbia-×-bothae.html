                    <h1>Euphorbia × bothae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia × bothae, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia × bothae is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
