<p>Echinocactus rafaelensis, commonly known as the Rafael's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that is ribbed and covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
