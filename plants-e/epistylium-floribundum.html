                    <h1>Epistylium floribundum</h1>
<p>Epistylium floribundum, commonly known as the flowering epistylium, is a species of colonial freshwater cyanobacterium belonging to the order Oscillatoriaceae.</p>
<p>It forms dense, gelatinous mats on the surfaces of aquatic environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant is characterized by its branching, filamentous structure and the presence of motile cells that contribute to its colonial growth. Epistylium floribundum is known for its ability to produce blooms under nutrient-rich conditions, which can impact water quality.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of freshwater ecosystems through its interactions with other microorganisms and its contribution to nutrient cycling.</p>
