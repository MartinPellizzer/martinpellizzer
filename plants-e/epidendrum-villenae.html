                    <h1>Epidendrum villenae</h1>
<p>Epidendrum villenae, commonly known as the Mexican Flame Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions.</p>
<p>Epidendrum villenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care.</p>
