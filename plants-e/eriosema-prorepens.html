<p>Eriosema prorepens, commonly known as the silky eriosema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, velvety appearance, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Eriosema prorepens is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
