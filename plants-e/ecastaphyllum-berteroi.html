                    <h1>Ecastaphyllum berteroi</h1>
<p>Ecastaphyllum berteroi, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prop roots that extend into the water, providing structural support and facilitating gas exchange. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by water. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
<p>Ecastaphyllum berteroi is widely distributed along tropical and subtropical coastlines around the world.</p>
