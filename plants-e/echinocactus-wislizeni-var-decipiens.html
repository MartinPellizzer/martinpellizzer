                    <h1>Echinocactus wislizeni var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Echinocactus wislizeni var. decipiens, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, which is covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green exterior. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
