<p>Eriocaulon, commonly known as the spike-rush, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that often appear in spike-like formations. They typically grow in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. Eriocaulon species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological importance make them an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
