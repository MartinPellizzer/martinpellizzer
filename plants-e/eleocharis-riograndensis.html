<p>Eleocharis riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. This plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis riograndensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions.</p>
