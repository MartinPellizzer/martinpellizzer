                    <h1>Euceraea rheophytica</h1>
<p>Euceraea rheophytica, commonly known as the streamside orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along streams and in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white and pale pink. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a consistently humid climate to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euceraea rheophytica is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
