<p>Euphorbia inappendiculata var. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland milk bush, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>

The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
