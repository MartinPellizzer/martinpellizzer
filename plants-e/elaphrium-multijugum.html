<p>Elaphrium multijugum, commonly known as the two-lobed elaphrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphrium multijugum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
