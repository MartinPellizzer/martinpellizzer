                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus grandicornis</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus grandicornis, commonly known as the giant horned cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the areoles. Its unique morphology, including its thick, fleshy stems and protective spines, is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
