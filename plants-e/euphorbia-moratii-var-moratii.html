<p>Euphorbia moratii var. moratii, commonly known as the Morat's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia moratii var. moratii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
