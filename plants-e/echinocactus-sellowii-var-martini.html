                    <h1>Echinocactus sellowii var. martini</h1>
<p>Echinocactus sellowii var. martini, commonly known as the Sellow's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
