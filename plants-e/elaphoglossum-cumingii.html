<p>Elaphoglossum cumingii, commonly known as Cuming's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum cumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
