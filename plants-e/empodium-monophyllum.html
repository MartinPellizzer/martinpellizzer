<p>Empodium monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, solitary, and thickly succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
