<p>Echinopsis caulescens, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Andes," is a species of cactus native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a single, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are short and white, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinopsis caulescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
