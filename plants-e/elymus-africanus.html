                    <h1>Elymus africanus</h1>
<p>Elymus africanus, commonly known as the African needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Elymus africanus plays a role in preventing soil erosion and is sometimes used in restoration projects in its native habitat.</p>
