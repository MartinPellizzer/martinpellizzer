                    <h1>Erythrodes oreadum</h1>
<p>Erythrodes oreadum, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
