<p>Elaphoglossum beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, characteristic of many ferns. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum beddomei is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its habitat.</p>
