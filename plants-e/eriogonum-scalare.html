<p>Eriogonum scalare, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eriogonum scalare plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
