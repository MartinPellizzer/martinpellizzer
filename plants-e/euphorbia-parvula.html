                    <h1>Euphorbia parvula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia parvula, commonly known as the "Little Spurge" or "Blue Euphorbia," is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, fleshy stems and bright blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
