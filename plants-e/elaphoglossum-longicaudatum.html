                    <h1>Elaphoglossum longicaudatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
