<p>Empetrum nigrum var. purpureum, commonly known as rosebay willowherb, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands, moors, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more vibrant floral coloration compared to the typical variety of Empetrum nigrum.</p>
