                    <h1>Eragrostis stenoclada</h1>
<p>Eragrostis stenoclada, commonly known as narrowleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Eragrostis stenoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
