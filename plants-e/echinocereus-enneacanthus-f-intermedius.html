                    <h1>Echinocereus enneacanthus f. intermedius</h1>
<p>Echinocereus enneacanthus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
