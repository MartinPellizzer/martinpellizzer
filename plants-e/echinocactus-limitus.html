<p>Echinocactus limitus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>

The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus limitus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
