<p>Epidendrum verrucosum, commonly known as the疣茎石斛, is a epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are elongated,革质 (leathery), and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
