<p>Elymus arenarius var. minor, commonly known as sandgrass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine,丛生 growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
