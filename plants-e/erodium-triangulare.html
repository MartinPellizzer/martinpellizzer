                <h1>Erodium triangulare</h1>
<p>Erodium triangulare, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Erodium triangulare is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
