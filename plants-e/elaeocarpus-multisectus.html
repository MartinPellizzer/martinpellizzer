                    <h1>Elaeocarpus multisectus</h1>
<p>Elaeocarpus multisectus, commonly known as the multi-lobed elaeocarp, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
