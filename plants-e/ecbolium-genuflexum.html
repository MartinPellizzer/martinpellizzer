                    <h1>Ecbolium genuflexum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium genuflexum, commonly known as the bending euphorbia, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling stem with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its thick, waxy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, Ecbolium genuflexum is sensitive to frost and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
