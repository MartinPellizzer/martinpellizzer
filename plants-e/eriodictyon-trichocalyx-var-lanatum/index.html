                            <h1>Eriodictyon Trichocalyx Var. Lanatum</h1>
<p>Eriodictyon trichocalyx var. lanatum is a unique and resilient plant native to the coastal regions of California. Known commonly as the woolly yerba santa, it thrives in harsh, sunny environments with well-drained soils. Its fuzzy, silver-gray leaves give it a distinctive appearance, while its small white flowers bloom in late spring. This plant has been used by indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties and is now valued for its ecological role. It is a symbol of the diverse and hardy flora found in California's chaparral ecosystems.</p>
