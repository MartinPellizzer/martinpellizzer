                    <h1>Euphorbia lorifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
