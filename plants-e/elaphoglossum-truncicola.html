<p>Elaphoglossum truncicola, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum truncicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats.</p>
