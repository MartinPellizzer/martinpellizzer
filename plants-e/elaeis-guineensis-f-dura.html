                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis f. dura</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis f. dura, commonly known as the hard-palm variant of the oil palm, is a botanical form characterized by its robust and dense fruit structure.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its thick, durable rachis, which makes it more resistant to mechanical damage during harvesting. The plant exhibits typical oil palm morphology, with large, fan-shaped leaves and clustered fruiting structures. It is primarily cultivated for its high oil yield and is often used in industrial applications.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is favored in regions with challenging environmental conditions.</p>
