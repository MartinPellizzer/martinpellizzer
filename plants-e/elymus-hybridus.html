<p>Elymus hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Elymus hybridus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
