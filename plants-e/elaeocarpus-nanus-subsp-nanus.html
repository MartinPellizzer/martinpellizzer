<p>nanus, commonly known as the dwarf satinwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for horticultural and ecological studies in tropical environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific leaf and fruit morphology compared to other Elaeocarpus species.</p>
