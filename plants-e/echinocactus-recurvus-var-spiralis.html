<p>Echinocactus recurvus var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that spiral upward as they grow, forming a distinctive, twisting shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which emerge from areoles along the stems. Its spines are typically reddish-brown and provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
