                    <h1>Epithecia calyculata</h1>
<p>Epithecia calyculata, commonly known as the yellow cup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange apothecia, which are typically cup-shaped and surrounded by a distinct marginal rim. The thallus is foliose, meaning it has a leaf-like structure, and is often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and habitat specificity.</p>
