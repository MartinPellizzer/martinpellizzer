<p>Eroteum arbutifolium, commonly known as the red-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are small, leathery, and typically have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
