                    <h1>Eragrostis retinens</h1>
<p>Eragrostis retinens, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
<p>Eragrostis retinens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
