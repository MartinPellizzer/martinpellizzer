                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus lamellosus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus lamellosus, commonly known as the ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged form. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
