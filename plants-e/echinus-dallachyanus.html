<p>Echinus dallachyanus, commonly known as the Dallachyan sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a distinctive, spiky appearance due to the presence of short, tuberculate projections along its body. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants.</p>
<p>Echinus dallachyanus plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the grazing pressure on algal communities.</p>
