                    <h1>Eleogiton duvalii</h1>
<p>Eleogiton duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's elephant tree, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a feature that allows it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eleogiton duvalii is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
