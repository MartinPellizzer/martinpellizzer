                    <h1>Exostigma rivulare</h1>
<p>Exostigma rivulare, commonly known as the river exostigma, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Exostigma rivulare plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
