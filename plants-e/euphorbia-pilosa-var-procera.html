                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosa var. procera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosa var. procera, commonly known as the tall spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with thick, ribbed stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
