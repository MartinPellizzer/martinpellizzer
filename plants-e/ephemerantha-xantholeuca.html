The plant has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a few weeks. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to survive in its often arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
