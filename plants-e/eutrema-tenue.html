                    <h1>Eutrema tenue</h1>
<p>Eutrema tenue, commonly known as slender sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Eutrema tenue is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
