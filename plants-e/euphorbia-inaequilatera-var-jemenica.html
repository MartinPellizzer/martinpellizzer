                    <h1>Euphorbia inaequilatera var. jemenica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia inaequilatera var. jemenica, commonly known as the Yemen euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by bracts. It is adapted to grow in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections.</p>
