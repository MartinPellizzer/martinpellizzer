<p>Erythronium montanum, commonly known as the mountain dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a cluster at the end of leafless stems.

<p>Erythronium montanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
