                    <h1>Eritrichium argenteum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Eritrichium argenteum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions.</p>
