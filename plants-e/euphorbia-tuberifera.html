                    <h1>Euphorbia tuberifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tuberifera is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
