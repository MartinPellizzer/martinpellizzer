<p>Echinocactus johnsonii subsp.</p>
<p>lutescens, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections.</p>
