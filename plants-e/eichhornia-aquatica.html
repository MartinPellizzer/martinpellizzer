                    <h1>Eichhornia aquatica</h1>
<p>Eichhornia aquatica, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has vibrant purple flowers and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can grow rapidly, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, and it reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively through runners.</p>
<p>Water hyacinth is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals and nutrients from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
