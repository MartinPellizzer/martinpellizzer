                    <h1>Epipactis abortiva</h1>
<p>Epipactis abortiva, commonly known as the abortive helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and thrives in nutrient-rich, humusy soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
