                    <h1>Echinocactus rubrispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus rubrispinus, commonly known as the red spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that are covered in bright red spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its succulent stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
