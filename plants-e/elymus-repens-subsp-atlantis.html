<p>Elymus repens subsp.</p>
<p>atlantis, commonly known as Atlantic grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
