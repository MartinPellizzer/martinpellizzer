                    <h1>Epigynium sprengelii</h1>
<p>Epigynium sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's epigynium, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is notable for its epigynous flowers, where the ovary is positioned below the attachment point of the petals and sepals. The plant typically features showy, five-petaled blooms that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a subject of study in plant morphology and evolutionary botany.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
