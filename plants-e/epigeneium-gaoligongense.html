                    <h1>Epigeneium gaoligongense</h1>
<p>Epigeneium gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong epigeneium, is a rare climbing vine native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in montane forests, where it relies on its climbing habit to reach sunlight. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
