                    <h1>Eugenia palmarina</h1>
<p>Eugenia palmarina, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking pink flowers and dense, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its aesthetic appeal. It produces small, egg-like structures that are often covered in a waxy coating, a feature that aids in its survival.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it can become a pest in some regions due to the presence of mealybugs that feed on its sap.</p>
