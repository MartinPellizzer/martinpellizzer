<p>Erodium crassifolium subsp.</p>
<p>maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in rocky and sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid environments.</p>
