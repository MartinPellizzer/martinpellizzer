                    <h1>Eucalyptus whitei</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus whitei, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range from white to pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus whitei is often found in open woodlands and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
