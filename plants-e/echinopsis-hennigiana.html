<p>Echinopsis hennigiana, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a short, rounded plant with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinopsis hennigiana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
