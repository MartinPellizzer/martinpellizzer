<p>Elymus serpentinus, commonly known as serpentine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Elymus serpentinus is also noted for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats.</p>
