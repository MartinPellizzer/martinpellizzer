<p>Elaphoglossum coimbra-buenoi, commonly known as the Coimbra-Bueno holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of humid tropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant exhibits a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum coimbra-buenoi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
