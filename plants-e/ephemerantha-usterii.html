                    <h1>Ephemerantha usterii</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha usterii, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its short lifespan and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility, it is often found in specialized botanical gardens or protected natural reserves.</p>
