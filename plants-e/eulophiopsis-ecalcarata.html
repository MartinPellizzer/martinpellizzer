                    <h1>Eulophiopsis ecalcarata</h1>
<p>Eulophiopsis ecalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Eulophiopsis ecalcarata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
