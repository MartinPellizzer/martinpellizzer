<p>Euphorbia falcata subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to further reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
