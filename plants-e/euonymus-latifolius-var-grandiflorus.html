The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and red, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
