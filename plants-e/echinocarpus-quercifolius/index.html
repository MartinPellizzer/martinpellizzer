                            <h1>Echinocarpus Quercifolius</h1>
<p>Echinocarpus tree, scientifically known as Echinocarpus quercifolius, is a unique species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. This tree is characterized by its distinctive spiky fruits and broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils near riverbanks or in forested areas. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties and ecological importance in its native habitat. Its striking appearance and ecological value make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
