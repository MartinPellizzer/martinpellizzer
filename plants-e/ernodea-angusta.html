                    <h1>Ernodea angusta</h1>
<p>Ernodea angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Ernodea angusta is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
