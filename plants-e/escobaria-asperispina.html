                    <h1>Escobaria asperispina</h1>
<p>Escobaria asperispina, commonly known as the rough spineless hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Escobaria asperispina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
