<p>Elaphoglossum cotoi, commonly known as the Coto Island holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features delicate, pinnate fronds with a soft, velvety texture, and its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori. Elaphoglossum cotoi is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in nutrient-rich, moist soil.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
