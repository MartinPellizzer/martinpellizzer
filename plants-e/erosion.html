                    <h1>Erosion</h1>
<p>Erosion, commonly known as the gradual wearing away of soil and rock by natural forces, is not a plant but a geological process.</p>
<p>However, certain plants can play a role in mitigating erosion by stabilizing soil with their roots. Vegetation such as grasses, shrubs, and trees helps prevent soil displacement by binding the earth together. These plants are often found in areas prone to erosion, such as slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Their presence is crucial for maintaining soil integrity and preventing land degradation.</p>
