                    <h1>Eugenia hoseana</h1>
<p>Eugenia hoseana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, bell-shaped berries that turn red when mature. These berries are often consumed by native wildlife and are also used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine.</p>
<p>Eugenia hoseana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
