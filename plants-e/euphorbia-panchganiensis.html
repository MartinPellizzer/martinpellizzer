<p>Euphorbia panchganiensis, commonly known as the Panchgani spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
