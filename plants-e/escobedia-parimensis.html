<p>Escobedia parimensis, commonly known as the Parime√±o escobedia, is a rare and delicate lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is pale yellow to whitish, with a granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes or fissures. It is known for its chemical composition, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This species is primarily found in South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Paraguay, where it thrives in specific microhabitats.</p>
