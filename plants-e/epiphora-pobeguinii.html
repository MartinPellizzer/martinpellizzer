                    <h1>Epiphora pobeguinii</h1>
<p>Epiphora pobeguinii, commonly known as the Pobeguin's epiphyte, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, appearing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epiphora pobeguinii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
