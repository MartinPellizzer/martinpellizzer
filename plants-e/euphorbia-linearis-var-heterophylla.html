<p>Euphorbia linearis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
