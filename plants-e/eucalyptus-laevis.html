                    <h1>Eucalyptus laevis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus laevis, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
