                    <h1>Echium lucidum</h1>
<p>Echium lucidum, commonly known as the shining evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The seeds of Echium lucidum are enclosed in a hard, capsule-like structure and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
