<p>Spring beauty, scientifically known as Erophila verna var. cochleata, is a delicate wildflower that blooms in early spring across North America. This variant of the common spring beauty is characterized by its small, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale pink. It thrives in open woodlands and rocky slopes, often carpeting the ground with its subtle blossoms. The plant is a symbol of renewal and resilience, marking the arrival of warmer weather. Its short blooming period makes it a cherished sight for nature enthusiasts and botanists alike.</p>
