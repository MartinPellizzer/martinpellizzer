                    <h1>Echinopsis arachnacantha var. sulphurea</h1>
<p>Echinopsis arachnacantha var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-horned cactus, is a rare and striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and a unique, almost coral-like appearance due to its yellowish coloration. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings.</p>
