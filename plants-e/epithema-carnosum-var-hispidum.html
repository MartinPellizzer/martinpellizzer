                    <h1>Epithema carnosum var. hispidum</h1>
<p>Epithema carnosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy leathery lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus with a distinct, granular texture and a pale to dark green or brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
