<p>Elymus alaskanus subsp.</p>
<p>sajanensis, commonly known as the Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces compact spikelets with awned lemmas, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
