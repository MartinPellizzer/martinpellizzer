                    <h1>Erythroxylum hasslerianum f. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum hasslerianum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and reddish stems, which are typical features of the Erythroxylum genus. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which have historically been used for traditional and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest due to its botanical similarities to other coca species and its ecological significance in the Andean ecosystem.</p>
