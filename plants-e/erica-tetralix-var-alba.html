<p>Erica tetralix var. alba, commonly known as the white heather, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Erica tetralix var. alba is often found in heathlands and moorlands, where it plays a key role in the local ecosystem.</p>
