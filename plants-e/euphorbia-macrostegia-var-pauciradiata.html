The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
