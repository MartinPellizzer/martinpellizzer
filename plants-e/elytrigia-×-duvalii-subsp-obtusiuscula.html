<p>Elytrigia × duvalii subsp.</p>
<p>obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
