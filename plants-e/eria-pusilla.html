<p>Eria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, slender stems and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for support rather than soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
