                    <h1>Euphorbia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in a distinctive white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Euphorbia angustifolia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
