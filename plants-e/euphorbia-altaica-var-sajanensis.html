                    <h1>Euphorbia altaica var. sajanensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia altaica var. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, a common adaptation in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it contributes to the unique flora of its native habitat.</p>
