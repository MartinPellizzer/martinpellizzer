<p>Eriocaulon modestum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, contributing to its compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in certain regions.</p>
