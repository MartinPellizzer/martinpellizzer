                    <h1>Espostoa calva</h1>
<p>Espostoa calva, commonly known as the white-flowered puya, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Espostoa calva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
