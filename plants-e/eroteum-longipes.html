                    <h1>Eroteum longipes</h1>
<p>Eroteum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed eroteum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests where the climate is cool and humid. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eroteum longipes is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
