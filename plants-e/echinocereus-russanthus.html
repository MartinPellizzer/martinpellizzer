<p>Echinocereus russanthus, commonly known as the Russian hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or purple fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is relatively easy to maintain once established.</p>
