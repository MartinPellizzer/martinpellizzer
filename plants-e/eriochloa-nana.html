                    <h1>Eriochloa nana</h1>
<p>Eriochloa nana, commonly known as dwarf eriochloa, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for tumbleweeds due to their lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and rapid growth make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
