                    <h1>Euphorbia subciliata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia subciliata, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
