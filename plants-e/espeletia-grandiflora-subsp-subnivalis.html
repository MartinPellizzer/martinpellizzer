<p>Espeletia grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>subnivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its rosette growth pattern allows it to retain heat and protect its core from freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to subnival conditions, thriving in areas with persistent snow cover.</p>
