                    <h1>Eremophila maculata var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Eremophila maculata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the spotted emu plant, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular flowers, usually in shades of red, pink, or purple, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
