                    <h1>Elaphoglossum obliquatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum obliquatum, commonly known as the oblique holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive oblique arrangement of the pinnae, giving it its common name.</p>
