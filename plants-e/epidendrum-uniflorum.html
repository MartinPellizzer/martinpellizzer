                    <h1>Epidendrum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower epidendron, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, which typically blooms in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum uniflorum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
