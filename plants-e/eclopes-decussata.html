                    <h1>Eclopes decussata</h1>
<p>Eclopes decussata, commonly known as the cross-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, cross-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eclopes decussata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
