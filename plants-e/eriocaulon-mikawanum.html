                    <h1>Eriocaulon mikawanum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon mikawanum, commonly known as the Mikawanum spikegrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on short, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems and plant adaptations.</p>
