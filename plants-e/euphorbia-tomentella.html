                    <h1>Euphorbia tomentella</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tomentella, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵 (flowers) that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be lance-shaped or oval, and it often grows in low, compact forms.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tomentella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
