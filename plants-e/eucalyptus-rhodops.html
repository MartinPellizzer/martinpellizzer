<p>Eucalyptus rhodops, commonly known as the red gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus rhodops is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>
