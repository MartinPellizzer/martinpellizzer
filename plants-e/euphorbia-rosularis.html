                    <h1>Euphorbia rosularis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rosularis, commonly known as the Rosular Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences, rather than typical flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
