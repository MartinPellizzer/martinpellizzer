<p>Euphorbia montenegrina var. bertiscea, commonly known as the Montenegro spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a caudex and produces a cluster of fleshy, green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-shaped inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
