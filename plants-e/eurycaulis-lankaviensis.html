                    <h1>Eurycaulis lankaviensis</h1>
<p>Eurycaulis lankaviensis, commonly known as the Lankaviensis fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-colored pattern of green and silver. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or on the bases of trees. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Eurycaulis lankaviensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
