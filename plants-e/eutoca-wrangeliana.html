<p>Eutoca wrangeliana, commonly known as Wrangel's eutoca, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Siberia and Alaska.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eutoca wrangeliana plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores.</p>
