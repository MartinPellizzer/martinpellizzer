                    <h1>Equisetum × inundatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum × inundatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a hybrid plant that combines features of several equisetum species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the plant, which are often hidden beneath the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
