<p>Eragrostis articulata var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
