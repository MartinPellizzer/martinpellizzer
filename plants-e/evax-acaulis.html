                    <h1>Evax acaulis</h1>
<p>Evax acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. Its flowers are typically followed by seed capsules that release wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Evax acaulis is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
