                    <h1>Eurya minutissima</h1>
<p>Eurya minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
