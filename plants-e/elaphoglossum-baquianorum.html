<p>Elaphoglossum baquianorum, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum baquianorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
