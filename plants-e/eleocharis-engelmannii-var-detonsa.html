                    <h1>Eleocharis engelmannii var. detonsa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis engelmannii var. detonsa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
