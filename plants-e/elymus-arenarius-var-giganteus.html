<p>Elymus arenarius var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant sandreed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, silver-green foliage and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that are typically brown or tan in color, which serve as its reproductive structures. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
