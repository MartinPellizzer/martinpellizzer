<p>Euphorbia nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nodiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
