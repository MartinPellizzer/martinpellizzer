                    <h1>Euphorbia geyeri var. microsperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia geyeri var. microsperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
