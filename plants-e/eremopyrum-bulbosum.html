                    <h1>Eremopyrum bulbosum</h1>
<p>Eremopyrum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous wildrye, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of bulbous basal stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum bulbosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
