                    <h1>Eleocharis subulata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis subulata, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, bladder-like fruits. Eleocharis subulata is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important part of aquatic and wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate the health of these environments due to its sensitivity to water quality.</p>
