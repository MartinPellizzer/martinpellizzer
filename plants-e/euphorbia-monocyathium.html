                <h1>Euphorbia monocyathium</h1>
<p>Euphorbia monocyathium, commonly known as the single-cyst flower or the one-cyst euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences that consist of a single cup-like structure containing both male and female flowers. It is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
