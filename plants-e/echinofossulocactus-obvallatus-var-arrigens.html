                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus obvallatus var. arrigens</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus obvallatus var. arrigens, commonly known as the Arrigens barrel cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to a small region in Mexico.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
