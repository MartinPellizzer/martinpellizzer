<p>Epidendrum yojoaense, commonly known as the Yojoa Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America, particularly Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often yellow or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum yojoaense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
