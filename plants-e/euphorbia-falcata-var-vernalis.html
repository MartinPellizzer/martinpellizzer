                    <h1>Euphorbia falcata var. vernalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia falcata var. vernalis, commonly known as the spring euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
