<p>Eremostachys affinis, commonly known as the desert gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremostachys affinis is well adapted to extreme temperatures and limited rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
