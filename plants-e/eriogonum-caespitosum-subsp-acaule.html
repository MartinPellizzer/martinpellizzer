<p>Eriogonum caespitosum subsp.</p>
<p>acaule, commonly known as the desert flax, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies acaule is distinguished by the absence of a distinct stem, with the leaves and flowers emerging directly from the root system.</p>
