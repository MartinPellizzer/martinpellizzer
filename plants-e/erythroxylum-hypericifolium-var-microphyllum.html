                    <h1>Erythroxylum hypericifolium var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum hypericifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped berries containing a single seed. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is closely related to the species used for traditional Andean practices.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to E. coca, it is sometimes considered a subspecies or variant in botanical classifications.</p>
