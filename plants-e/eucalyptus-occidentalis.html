                    <h1>Eucalyptus occidentalis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus occidentalis, commonly known as the red mahogany gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, red-brown bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it popular in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus occidentalis is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy.</p>
