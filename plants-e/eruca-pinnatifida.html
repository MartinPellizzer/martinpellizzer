                    <h1>Eruca pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Eruca pinnatifida, commonly known as wild rocket or Italian arugula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed, with a peppery, spicy aroma due to its high concentration of glucosinolates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common weed in cultivated fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its widespread distribution across temperate climates.</p>
