                            <h1>Erysimum Parryoides</h1>
<p>Erysimum parryoides is a striking member of the Brassicaceae family known for its vibrant yellow flowers. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in arid and rocky environments. This plant is often referred to as Parry's wallflower due to its ability to grow in harsh, dry conditions. Its compact growth habit and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. With its resilience and beauty, Erysimum parryoides is both an ecological and ornamental asset.</p>
