<p>Elytrigia repens subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocaesia, commonly known as false bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its tolerance to moderate grazing.</p>
<p>The subspecies pseudocaesia is distinguished by its slightly different morphological features compared to the typical form of Elytrigia repens.</p>
