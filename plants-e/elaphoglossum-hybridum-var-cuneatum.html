                    <h1>Elaphoglossum hybridum var. cuneatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum hybridum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species in the study of fern diversity.</p>
