                    <h1>Equisetum huegelii var. majus</h1>
<p>Equisetum huegelii var. majus, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like projections, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
