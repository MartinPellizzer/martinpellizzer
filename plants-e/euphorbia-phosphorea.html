                    <h1>Euphorbia phosphorea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia phosphorea, commonly known as the phosphorescent spurge, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, greenish-gray stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions, a trait that is rare among succulents. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and nocturnal glow.</p>
