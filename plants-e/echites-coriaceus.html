<p>Echites coriaceus, commonly known as the rough echites, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in a thick, leathery cuticle that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Echites coriaceus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought-prone environments.</p>
