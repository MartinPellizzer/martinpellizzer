                    <h1>Evax involucrata</h1>
<p>Evax involucrata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through a deep root system and a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Its leaves are typically narrow and reduced, minimizing surface area for evaporation.</p>
<p>Evax involucrata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
