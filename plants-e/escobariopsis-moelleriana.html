<p>Escobariopsis moelleriana, commonly known as the Mexican feather moss, is a small, epiphytic moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green foliage. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in Mexico and Central America. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Escobariopsis moelleriana is adapted to low-nutrient conditions and is often found in cloud forests, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the understory.</p>
