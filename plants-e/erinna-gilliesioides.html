<p>Erinna gilliesioides, commonly known as the Gillies' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
