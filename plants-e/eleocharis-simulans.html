<p>Eleocharis simulans, commonly known as the false spikerush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis simulans plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
