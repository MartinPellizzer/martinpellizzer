                    <h1>Ephedra flava</h1>
<p>Ephedra flava, commonly known as yellow ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its green to yellow stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the medicinal alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Its stems are often harvested for use in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Ephedra flava is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its ability to store water and minimize transpiration.</p>
