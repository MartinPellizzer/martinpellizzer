The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on slender, upright stems. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in local ecosystems, where it contributes to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
