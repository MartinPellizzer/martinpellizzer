                    <h1>Elaphoglossum permutatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum permutatum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum permutatum is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
