<p>Eriocoma clematidea, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Eriocoma clematidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
