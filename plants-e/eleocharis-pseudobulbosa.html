                    <h1>Eleocharis pseudobulbosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the false bulrush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis pseudobulbosa plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
