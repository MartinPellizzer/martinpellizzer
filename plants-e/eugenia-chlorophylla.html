                    <h1>Eugenia chlorophylla</h1>
<p>Eugenia chlorophylla, commonly known as the green eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eugenia chlorophylla is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its essential oils are used in aromatherapy and have antimicrobial properties.</p>
