                    <h1>Euphorbia leviana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia leviana, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
