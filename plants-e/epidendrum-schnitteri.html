<p>Epidendrum schnitteri, commonly known as the Schmitter's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
