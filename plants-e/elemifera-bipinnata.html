                    <h1>Elemifera bipinnata</h1>
<p>Elemifera bipinnata, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in incense and perfumery.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
