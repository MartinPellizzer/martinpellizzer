<p>Eutrema himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Eutrema himalaicum is adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions.</p>
