<p>Euphorbia megalatlantica subsp.</p>
<p>briquetii, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a compact form that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaping.</p>
