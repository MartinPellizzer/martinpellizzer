<p>Erodium chium var. renifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped, giving it its varietal name "renifolium.". The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by slender, hairy pods containing seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
