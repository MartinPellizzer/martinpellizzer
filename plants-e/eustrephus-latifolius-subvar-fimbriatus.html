                    <h1>Eustrephus latifolius subvar. fimbriatus</h1>
<p>Eustrephus latifolius subvar. fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that often have a fringed or toothed edge, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild.</p>
