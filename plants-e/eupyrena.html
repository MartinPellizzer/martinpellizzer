                    <h1>Eupyrena</h1>
<p>Eupyrena, commonly known as the common blue butterfly, is not a plant but a species of butterfly.</p>
<p>However, it is often associated with certain flowering plants that serve as host or nectar sources. The larvae of Eupyrena feed on plants such as thistles and other members of the Asteraceae family. These plants have composite flowers with both ray and disk florets, providing a rich source of nectar.</p>
<p>The botanical relationships between Eupyrena and these plants are essential for the butterfly's life cycle and ecological role.</p>
