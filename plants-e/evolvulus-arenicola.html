<p>Evolvulus arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Evolvulus arenicola is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
