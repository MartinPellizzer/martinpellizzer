                    <h1>Ephedra antisyphilitica var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Ephedra antisyphilitica var. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential toxicity, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
