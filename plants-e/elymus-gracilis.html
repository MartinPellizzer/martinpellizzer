                    <h1>Elymus gracilis</h1>
<p>Elymus gracilis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration ecology.</p>
<p>Elymus gracilis is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
