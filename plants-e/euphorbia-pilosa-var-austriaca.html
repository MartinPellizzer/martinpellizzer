                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosa var. austriaca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosa var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian rough spurge, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, waxy, and often spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly nature, it is generally avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling to prevent skin irritation.</p>
