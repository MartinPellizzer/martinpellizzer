<p>Erodium praecox var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
