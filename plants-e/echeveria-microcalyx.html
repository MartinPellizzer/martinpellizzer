                    <h1>Echeveria microcalyx</h1>
<p>Echeveria microcalyx, commonly known as the miniature echeveria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a bluish tint, covered in a fine layer of white powder called farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its compact shape.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
