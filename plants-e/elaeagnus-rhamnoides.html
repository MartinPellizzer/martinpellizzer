                    <h1>Elaeagnus rhamnoides</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus rhamnoides, commonly known as silver berry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its capacity for nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are often clustered in catkins.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus rhamnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
