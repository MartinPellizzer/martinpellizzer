                    <h1>Epipactis microphylla f. canescens</h1>
<p>Epipactis microphylla f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy-leaved helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip that is usually darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
