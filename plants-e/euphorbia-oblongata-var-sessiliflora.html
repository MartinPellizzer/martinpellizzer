<p>Euphorbia oblongata var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically small, rounded, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
