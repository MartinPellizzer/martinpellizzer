                    <h1>Elaphoglossum biolleyi</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum biolleyi, commonly known as the Biolley's holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are closely clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum biolleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
