<p>Eleocharis biseptata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on tall, upright inflorescences. Eleocharis biseptata thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
