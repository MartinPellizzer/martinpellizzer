<p>Ebenidium pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature.</p>
<p>Ebenidium pinnatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
