<p>Echeveria buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtienii Echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or lavender during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
