<p>Equisetum pratense var. pyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scouring rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, needle-like structures, and it is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other equisetum species.</p>
