<p>Elaphoglossum laticuneatum, commonly known as the broad-veined harts-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with pinnately compound leaves that have broad, lance-shaped lobes. Its fronds are usually dark green and possess a distinctive, rough texture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
