<p>Elaphoglossum lasiolepium, commonly known as the woolly holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum lasiolepium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation.</p>
