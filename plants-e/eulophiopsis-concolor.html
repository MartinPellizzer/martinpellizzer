                    <h1>Eulophiopsis concolor</h1>
<p>Eulophiopsis concolor, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Eulophiopsis concolor thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
