<p>Elaphoglossum tovii, commonly known as the Tovii holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Elaphoglossum tovii is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
