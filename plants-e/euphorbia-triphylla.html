<p>Euphorbia triphylla, commonly known as the triple leaf spurges, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which are arranged in a rosette pattern and have a waxy, bluish-green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
