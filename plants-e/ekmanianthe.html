                    <h1>Ekmanianthe</h1>
<p>Ekmanianthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its flowers are often short-lived, blooming only briefly before withering, which adds to its mystique.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Ekmanianthe is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
