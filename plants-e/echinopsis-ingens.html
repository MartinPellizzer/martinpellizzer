                    <h1>Echinopsis ingens</h1>
<p>Echinopsis ingens, commonly known as the giant echinopsis, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bats and insects. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinopsis ingens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
