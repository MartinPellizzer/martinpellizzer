                    <h1>Eleocharis palustris var. mucronulata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis palustris var. mucronulata, commonly known as the spike rush, is a sedgy, grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has cylindrical stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
