<p>Erysimum sylvestre subsp.</p>
<p>banaticum, commonly known as the Banat wild mustard, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering period is relatively short, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for hybridization with other Erysimum species.</p>
