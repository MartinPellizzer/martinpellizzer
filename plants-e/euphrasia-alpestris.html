                    <h1>Euphrasia alpestris</h1>
<p>Euphrasia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine eyebright, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it primarily relies on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive yellow spots, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Euphrasia alpestris is often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations.</p>
