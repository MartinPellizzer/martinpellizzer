<p>Epipactis latifolia subsp.</p>
<p>microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The subspecies microphylla is distinguished by its smaller, more compact leaves compared to the broader leaves of the main species.</p>
