                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile var. leptocladon</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. leptocladon, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a variant of the water horsetail, characterized by its slender, wiry stems and reduced leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet, marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often submerged in water. Its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
