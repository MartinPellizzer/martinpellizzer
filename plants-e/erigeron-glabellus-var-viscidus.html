                    <h1>Erigeron glabellus var. viscidus</h1>
<p>Erigeron glabellus var. viscidus, commonly known as sticky blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, viscid (sticky) stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and contribute to its ecological role in its native range.</p>
