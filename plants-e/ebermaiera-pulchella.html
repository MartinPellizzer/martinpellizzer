                    <h1>Ebermaiera pulchella</h1>
<p>Ebermaiera pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
