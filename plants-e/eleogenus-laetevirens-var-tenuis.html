<p>Eleogenus laetevirens var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender green eleogenus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale green to white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall graceful appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
