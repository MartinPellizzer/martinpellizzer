                    <h1>Euphorbia rhabdotosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rhabdotosperma, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cluster known as a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rhabdotosperma is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
