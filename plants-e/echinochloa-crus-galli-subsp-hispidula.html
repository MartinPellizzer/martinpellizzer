                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli subsp. hispidula</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli subsp.</p>
<p>hispidula, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brown florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It produces wind-dispersed seeds that can persist in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential in certain environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser pubescence compared to other members of the Echinochloa genus.</p>
