                    <h1>Epipactis corallorhiza</h1>
<p>Epipactis corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a small, root-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant produces no leaves or stems, relying solely on its root system to absorb nutrients from the fungi. It is known for its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on specific fungi, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
