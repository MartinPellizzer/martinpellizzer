                    <h1>Euphorbia oraria</h1>
<p>Euphorbia oraria, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia oraria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
