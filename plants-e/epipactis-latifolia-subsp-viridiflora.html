<p>Epipactis latifolia subsp.</p>
<p>viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and its striking, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a complex reproductive system involving mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the Epipactis genus.</p>
