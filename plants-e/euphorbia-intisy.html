                    <h1>Euphorbia intisy</h1>
<p>Euphorbia intisy, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia intisy is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
