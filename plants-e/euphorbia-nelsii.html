                    <h1>Euphorbia nelsii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nelsii, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. Its most distinctive feature is its crown-like arrangement of spiny, green leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by a gelatinous, toxic seed capsule.</p>
<p>It is important to handle the plant with care, as its sap can cause skin irritation.</p>
