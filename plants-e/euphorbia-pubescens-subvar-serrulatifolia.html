                    <h1>Euphorbia pubescens subvar. serrulatifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pubescens subvar. serrulatifolia, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in fine, white pubescence, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated at the edges, and often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
