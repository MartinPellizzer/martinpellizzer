                    <h1>Elaphoglossum eximium f. minus</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum eximium f. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Elaphoglossum eximium.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
