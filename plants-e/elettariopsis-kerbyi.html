                    <h1>Elettariopsis kerbyi</h1>
<p>Elettariopsis kerbyi, commonly known as the Kerby's elettariopsis, is a rare and little-studied member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
