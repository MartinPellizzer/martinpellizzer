<p>Eremochloa lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spiky inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. It often grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eremochloa lanceolata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
