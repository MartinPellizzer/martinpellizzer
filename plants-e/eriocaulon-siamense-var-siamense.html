<p>Eriocaulon siamense var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
