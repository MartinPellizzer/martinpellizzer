<p>Euphorbia pallida, commonly known as the pale spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem that is typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pallida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
