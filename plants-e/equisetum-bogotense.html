                    <h1>Equisetum bogotense</h1>
<p>Equisetum bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot√° horsetail, is a species of horsetail native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are important for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous and boggy environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a unique combination of ancient and modern plant features.</p>
