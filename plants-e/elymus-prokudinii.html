<p>Elymus prokudinii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
