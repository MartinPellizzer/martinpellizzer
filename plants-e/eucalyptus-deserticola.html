                    <h1>Eucalyptus deserticola</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus deserticola, commonly known as the desert eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
