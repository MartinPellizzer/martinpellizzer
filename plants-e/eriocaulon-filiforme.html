<p>Eriocaulon filiforme, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, thread-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, contributing to its delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy or wet soil environments.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon filiforme is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as marshes and ponds.</p>
