<p>Echinops spinosus subsp.</p>
<p>fontqueri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, globe-shaped crown and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
