                    <h1>Euphorbia triflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences, rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
