<p>Elytrigia intermedia subsp.</p>
<p>mucronata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its short, sharp apical bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance among other grasses.</p>
