<p>Eremopyrum fibrosum, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, grass-like foliage and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum fibrosum is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
