                    <h1>Euphorbia otavibergensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia otavibergensis, commonly known as the Otavi euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a prized addition to collections of succulents and cacti.</p>
