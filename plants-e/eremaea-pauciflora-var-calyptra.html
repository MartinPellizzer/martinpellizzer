                    <h1>Eremaea pauciflora var. calyptra</h1>
<p>Eremaea pauciflora var. calyptra, commonly known as the small-leaf eremaea, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rehabilitation of degraded soils.</p>
<p>The variety calyptra is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics compared to other varieties of Eremaea pauciflora.</p>
