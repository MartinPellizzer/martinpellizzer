<p>Echites cyaniphyllus, commonly known as the blue-leafed echites, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid blue-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echites cyaniphyllus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
