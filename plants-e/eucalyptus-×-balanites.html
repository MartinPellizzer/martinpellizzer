                    <h1>Eucalyptus × balanites</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × balanites, commonly known as the honey gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus balanoides.</p>
<p>It is a medium to tall tree characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is native to southeastern Australia, where it is often found in dry sclerophyll forests.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × balanites is valued for its timber, which is strong and durable, as well as its role in ecological systems and traditional uses by Indigenous communities.</p>
