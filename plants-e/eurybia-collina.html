The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and features daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, basal, and often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from herbivores and moisture loss.</p>
<p>Eurybia collina is often found in moist soils and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
