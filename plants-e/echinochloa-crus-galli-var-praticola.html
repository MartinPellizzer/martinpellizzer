<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. praticola, commonly known as common barnyardgrass, is an annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple at maturity. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is well-adapted to a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. It is considered a major weed in agricultural fields, particularly in rice and corn crops.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to manage in cultivated ecosystems.</p>
