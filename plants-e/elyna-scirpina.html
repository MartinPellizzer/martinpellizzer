<p>Elyna scirpina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Elyna scirpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
