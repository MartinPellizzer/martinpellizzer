                    <h1>Epithecia glauca</h1>
<p>Epithecia glauca, commonly known as the bluish lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leathery thallus with a bluish-green upper surface and a darker, more granular lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
