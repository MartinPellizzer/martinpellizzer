<p>Elaphoglossum deorsum, commonly known as the upland hawksbeard, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often arched or curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum deorsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
