<p>Euphorbia willowmorensis, commonly known as the Willowmore euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching stem structure with a rough, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
