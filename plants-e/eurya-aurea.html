                    <h1>Eurya aurea</h1>
<p>Eurya aurea, commonly known as golden eurya, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by bright orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The berries are also a food source for various bird species, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
