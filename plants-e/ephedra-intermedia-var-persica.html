                    <h1>Ephedra intermedia var. persica</h1>
<p>Ephedra intermedia var. persica, commonly known as Persian ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains ephedrine, a stimulant alkaloid, which has historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
