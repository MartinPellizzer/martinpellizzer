                    <h1>Eleocharis paradoxa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox grass or swamp arrowhead, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis paradoxa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality.</p>
