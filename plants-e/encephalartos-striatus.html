<p>Encephalartos striatus, commonly known as the Zulu cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos striatus is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
