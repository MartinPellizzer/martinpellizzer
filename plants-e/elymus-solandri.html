<p>Elymus solandri, commonly known as the coastal wild rye, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.
