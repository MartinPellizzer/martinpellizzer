                    <h1>Eleutherococcus eleutheristylus</h1>
<p>Eleutherococcus eleutheristylus, commonly known as the Siberian ginseng, is a deciduous shrub native to the forests of Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, pinnately compound leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties, though its botanical classification remains a subject of debate among taxonomists.</p>
