                    <h1>Erythrina rubicunda</h1>
<p>Erythrina rubicunda, commonly known as the scarlet coral tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three elliptical leaflets, and its woody structure supports its role as a ornamental and ecological species. Erythrina rubicunda is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds for propagation.</p>
