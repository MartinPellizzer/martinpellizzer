<p>Entelea palmata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in tidal zones and absorb oxygen from the air. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a bright red drupe that contains a single seed, aiding in its dispersal by water and animals.</p>
