<p>Euphorbia pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem with swollen, fleshy nodes that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pentadactyla is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
