<p>Echinocactus arrigens, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus arrigens is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance.</p>
