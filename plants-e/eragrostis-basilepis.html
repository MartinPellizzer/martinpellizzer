<p>Eragrostis basilepis, commonly known as blackgrass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Eragrostis basilepis is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
