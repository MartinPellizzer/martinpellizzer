                    <h1>Erica rupicola</h1>
<p>Erica rupicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are usually pink or white and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Erica rupicola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
