<p>Echinocactus intricatus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its spiny, ribbed structure helps it retain water in its native desert environment.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
