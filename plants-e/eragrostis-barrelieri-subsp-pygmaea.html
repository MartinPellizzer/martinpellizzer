<p>Eragrostis barrelieri subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf speargrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems that rarely exceed a few centimeters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow, hairless, and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
