                    <h1>Echinopsis klimpeliana</h1>
<p>Echinopsis klimpeliana, commonly known as the Klimpel's candelabra cactus, is a striking succulent native to northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a crown of spiny, white flowers. The plant features a ribbed structure with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
