                    <h1>Elymus turuchanensis</h1>
<p>Elymus turuchanensis, commonly known as the Turuchan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, tufted growth habit, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Elymus turuchanensis is well-suited to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows.</p>
