<p>Euphorbia kelleri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution.</p>
