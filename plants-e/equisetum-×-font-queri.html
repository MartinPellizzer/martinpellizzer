                    <h1>Equisetum × font-queri</h1>
<p>Equisetum × font-queri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are often visible in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
