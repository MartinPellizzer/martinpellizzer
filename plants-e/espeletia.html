                    <h1>Espeletia</h1>
<p>Espeletia, commonly known as the "Puya" or "Hogarthia," is a genus of flowering plants native to South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped growth habit and large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height. Espeletia species are adapted to high-altitude environments, often thriving in rocky or arid conditions. Their leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in summer, are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
