<p>Espeletia santanderensis, commonly known as the Santanderan heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the dry, cold conditions of the p√°ramo ecosystem. Its foliage is typically covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help insulate the plant from extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Espeletia santanderensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
