<p>Euphorbia esula var. pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive pine-like leaves that are narrow and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed.</p>
