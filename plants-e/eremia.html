                    <h1>Eremia</h1>
<p>Eremia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Eremia species are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often pale pink or white flowers. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Eremia mochouana and Eremia littoralis, which are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
