<p>Epaltes umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the eastern coast of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
<p>Epaltes umbelliformis is also notable for its slow growth rate and preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
