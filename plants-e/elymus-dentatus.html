The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Elymus dentatus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
