                    <h1>Euphorbia squamigera var. montgoi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia squamigera var. montgoi, commonly known as the Montgoi spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
