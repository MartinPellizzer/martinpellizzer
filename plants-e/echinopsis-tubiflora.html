                    <h1>Echinopsis tubiflora</h1>
<p>Echinopsis tubiflora, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, ribbed structure helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinopsis tubiflora is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in cactus gardens.</p>
