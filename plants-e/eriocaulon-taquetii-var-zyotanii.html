                    <h1>Eriocaulon taquetii var. zyotanii</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon taquetii var. zyotanii, commonly known as the Zhyotanii bulbous sedge, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bulbous rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense, white pubescence. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
