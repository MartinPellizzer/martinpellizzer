                    <h1>Erica paludosa</h1>
<p>Erica paludosa, commonly known as bog heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet, acidic environments of northern Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in peat bogs and heathlands, where it forms dense mats that stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Erica paludosa plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species.</p>
