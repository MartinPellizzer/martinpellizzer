<p>Erica spuria, commonly known as the Heath Spurge or Heath Spurweed, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland heathland environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense cover that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Erica spuria is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
