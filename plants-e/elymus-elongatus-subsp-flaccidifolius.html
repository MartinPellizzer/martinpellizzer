<p>Elymus elongatus subsp.</p>
<p>flaccidifolius, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically shorter and more flexible than those of the main species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
