<p>Epilobium vernicosum, commonly known as the creeping willow or common willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, often calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Epilobium vernicosum is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats.</p>
