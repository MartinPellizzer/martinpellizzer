<p>Encephalartos preissii, commonly known as the Cape cress, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
