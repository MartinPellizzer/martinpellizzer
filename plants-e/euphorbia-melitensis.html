                    <h1>Euphorbia melitensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
