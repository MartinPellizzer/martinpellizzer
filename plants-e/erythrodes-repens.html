                <h1>Erythrodes repens</h1>
<p>Erythrodes repens, commonly known as the creeping redweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a reddish tint, especially when young.</p>
<p>Erythrodes repens is often found in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
