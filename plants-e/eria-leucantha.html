<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests or moist woodlands. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
