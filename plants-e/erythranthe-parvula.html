                    <h1>Erythranthe parvula</h1>
<p>Erythranthe parvula, commonly known as the dwarf evening primrose, is a small annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Erythranthe parvula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
