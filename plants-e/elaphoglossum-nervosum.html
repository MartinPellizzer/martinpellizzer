<p>Elaphoglossum nervosum, commonly known as the veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
