                    <h1>Erysimastrum gelidum</h1>
<p>Erysimastrum gelidum, commonly known as the alpine frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. This perennial herb thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
