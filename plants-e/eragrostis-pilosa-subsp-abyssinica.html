<p>Eragrostis pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Ethiopia and neighboring regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, slender leaves that are often covered with fine, erect hairs.</p>
