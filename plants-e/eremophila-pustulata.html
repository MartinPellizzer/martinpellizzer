<p>Eremophila pustulata, commonly known as the woolly emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low rainfall environments.</p>
<p>Eremophila pustulata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
