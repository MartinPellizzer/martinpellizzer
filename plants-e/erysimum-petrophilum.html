                    <h1>Erysimum petrophilum</h1>
<p>Erysimum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock eryngo, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Erysimum petrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
