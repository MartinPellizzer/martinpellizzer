                    <h1>Euphorbia celastroides var. typica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia celastroides var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, often spiny stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
