                    <h1>Equisetum variegatum var. laeve</h1>
<p>Equisetum variegatum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth variable horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are typically smooth and lack the ridges found in other horsetail varieties. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
