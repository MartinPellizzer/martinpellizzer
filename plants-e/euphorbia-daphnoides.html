<p>Euphorbia daphnoides, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
