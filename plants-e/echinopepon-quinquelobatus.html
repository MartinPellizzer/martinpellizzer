<p>Echinopepon quinquelobatus, commonly known as the five-lobed horned melon, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>

Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often cultivated more for its unusual appearance than for its culinary use.</p>
