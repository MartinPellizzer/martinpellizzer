                    <h1>Elatostema parasiticum</h1>
<p>Elatostema parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic elatostema, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and minerals through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Elatostema parasiticum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host plant populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
