                    <h1>Euphorbia stracheyi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stracheyi, commonly known as the Strachey's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with modified leaves that form a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia stracheyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
