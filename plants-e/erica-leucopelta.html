                    <h1>Erica leucopelta</h1>
<p>Erica leucopelta, commonly known as the white-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica leucopelta is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature.</p>
