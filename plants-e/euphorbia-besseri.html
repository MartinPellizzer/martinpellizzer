                    <h1>Euphorbia besseri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia besseri, commonly known as the Bessera euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia besseri is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in horticulture.</p>
