                    <h1>Erythrina neglecta</h1>
<p>Erythrina neglecta, commonly known as the flame tree or red tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often in the summer months. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spread.</p>
