<p>Eremostachys laciniata subsp.</p>
<p>sanguinea, commonly known as the red-leaved eryngo, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and narrow, lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
