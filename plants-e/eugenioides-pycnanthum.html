<p>Eugenioides pycnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture.

These flowers are followed by small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Eugenioides pycnanthum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
