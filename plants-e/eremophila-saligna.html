                    <h1>Eremophila saligna</h1>
<p>Eremophila saligna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Eremophila saligna is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
