                    <h1>Erythroxylum emarginatum var. caffrum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum emarginatum var. caffrum, commonly known as the Cape stimulant or wild coca, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive emarginate (notched) base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, hairy capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its alkaloid content, it has historical and traditional uses, though it is not as well-known as other Erythroxylum species.</p>
