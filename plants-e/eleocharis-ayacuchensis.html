<p>Eleocharis ayacuchensis, commonly known as the Ayacuchensis spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
