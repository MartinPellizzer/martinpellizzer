                    <h1>Erigeron glacialis</h1>
<p>Erigeron glacialis, commonly known as glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The small white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
