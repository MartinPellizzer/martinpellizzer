                    <h1>Eichhornia martiana</h1>
<p>Eichhornia martiana, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are bright green and covered in a waxy layer, and its striking purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has long, thin roots that hang beneath the water, and it spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to form dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Water hyacinth plays a role in water filtration but can disrupt aquatic ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
