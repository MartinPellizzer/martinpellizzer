<p>Ephedra stenosperma, commonly known as jointfoot ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its green, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and later develops small, woody capsules containing seeds. Ephedra stenosperma is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>It is also of interest in botanical studies for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
