<p>Echinops echinophorus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which give it its common name. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Echinops echinophorus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability.</p>
