<p>Eleocharis attenuata var. attenuata, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This species is native to various regions of the Americas and is adapted to a wide range of wetland environments.</p>
