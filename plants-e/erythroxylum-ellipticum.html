<p>Erythroxylum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is notable for its potential medicinal properties and has been studied for its alkaloid content.</p>
<p>However, it is not closely related to the coca plant, despite some common misconceptions.</p>
