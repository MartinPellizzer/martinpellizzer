                    <h1>Euphorbia longispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in stiff, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia longispina is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to arid conditions.</p>
