<p>Eriocephala claviceps subsp.</p>
<p>itaubensis, commonly known as the Itauba cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions of the country.</p>
