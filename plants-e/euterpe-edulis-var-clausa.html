<p>Euterpe edulis var. clausa, commonly known as the "juçara palm," is a species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.</p>
<p>It is a small, clustered palm that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are rich in oil. The fruit's pulp is used to make a popular local beverage called "ajuí" or "ajuí de juçara.".</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are underway to protect it.</p>
