<p>Espeletia conglomerata, commonly known as the "Páramo Giant," is a striking plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in the cold, high-altitude environment. The plant forms large, cushion-like rosettes that can reach heights of up to two meters. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom in spring and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Espeletia conglomerata plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various species.</p>
