<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>naousaensis, commonly known as the Naousa orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
