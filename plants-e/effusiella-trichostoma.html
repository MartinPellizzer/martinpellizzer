<p>Effusiella trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and is covered in fine, hairy structures called rhizoids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, capsule-like structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Effusiella trichostoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
