                    <h1>Echinocactus schilinzkyanus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus schilinzkyanus, commonly known as the Schiller's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that is ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative ornamental plant in desert gardens.</p>
