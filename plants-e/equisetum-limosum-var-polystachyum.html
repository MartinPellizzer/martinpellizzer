                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. polystachyum</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its tall, spore-bearing stems and whorled arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in wet, marshy environments, often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. The plant contains silica, giving it a rigid, woody texture and making it resistant to grazing. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are located at the top of the stems and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and is considered a living fossil.</p>
