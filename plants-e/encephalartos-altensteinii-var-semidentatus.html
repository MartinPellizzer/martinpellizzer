                    <h1>Encephalartos altensteinii var. semidentatus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos altensteinii var. semidentatus, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinct, narrow, and serrated appearance. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaflets and subtle differences in leaflet shape compared to other Encephalartos species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>
