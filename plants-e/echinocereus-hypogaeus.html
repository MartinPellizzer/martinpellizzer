<p>Echinocereus hypogaeus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense, mat-like clusters. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are ribbed and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinocereus hypogaeus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
