                    <h1>Eryngium marginatum</h1>
<p>Eryngium marginatum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Eryngium marginatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal or sandy soils.</p>
