                    <h1>Euphorbia pilulifera var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilulifera var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
