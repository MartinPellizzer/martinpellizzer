                    <h1>Euphorbia epiphylloides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia epiphylloides, commonly known as the leafy euphorbia, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
