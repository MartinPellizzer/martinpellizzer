<p>Euphorbia basutica, commonly known as the Basutu spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia basutica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
