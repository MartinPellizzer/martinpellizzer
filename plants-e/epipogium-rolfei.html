                    <h1>Epipogium rolfei</h1>
<p>Epipogium rolfei, commonly known as the Rolfe's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Native to the moist, shaded understoreys of forests in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts.</p>
