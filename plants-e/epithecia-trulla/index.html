                            <h1>Epithecia Trulla</h1>
<p>The Epithecia trulla is a small, cup-shaped lichen commonly found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Xanthopsoriaceae and is known for its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored thallus. This lichen thrives in temperate regions and is often seen on bark, stones, or soil surfaces. Its simple structure makes it an important indicator of environmental conditions. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a vital role in ecological systems.</p>
