                    <h1>Elaterium ciliatum</h1>
<p>Elaterium ciliatum, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap unsuspecting prey, primarily aquatic insects. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, ciliate hairs that give it its scientific name. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its specialized adaptations to supplement its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Elaterium ciliatum plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the local food web and maintaining water ecosystem balance.</p>
