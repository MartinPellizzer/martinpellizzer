<p>Exostema orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaved exostema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular (rounded) leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often hairy and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>Exostema orbiculatum is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm, humid climates.</p>
