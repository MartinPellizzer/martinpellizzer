                            <h1>Elleanthus Lepidus</h1>
<p>Elleanthus lepidus is a striking member of the Asteraceae family known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers. Native to the arid regions of South Africa, this plant thrives in harsh, sun-drenched environments. Its unique appearance features slender stems and bright yellow petals that stand out against the landscape. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more common garden plants. This resilient species offers valuable insights into the adaptability of flora in extreme climates.</p>
