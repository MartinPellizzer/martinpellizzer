                    <h1>Euphorbia decliviticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia decliviticola, commonly known as the cliff euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
