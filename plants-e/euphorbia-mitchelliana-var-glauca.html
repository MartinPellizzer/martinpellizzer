                    <h1>Euphorbia mitchelliana var. glauca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mitchelliana var. glauca, commonly known as Mitchell's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces unique, spiny cyathia (modified flowers) that are often yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
