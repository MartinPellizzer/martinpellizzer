                    <h1>Elymus gangotrianus</h1>
<p>Elymus gangotrianus, commonly known as the Tibetan wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Elymus gangotrianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
