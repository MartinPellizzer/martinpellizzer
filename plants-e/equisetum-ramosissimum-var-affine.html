<p>Equisetum ramosissimum var. affine, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically clustered in a dense, spike-like structure. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other horsetail species and is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
