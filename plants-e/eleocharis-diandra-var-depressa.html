                    <h1>Eleocharis diandra var. depressa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis diandra var. depressa, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and reproductive strategy make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
