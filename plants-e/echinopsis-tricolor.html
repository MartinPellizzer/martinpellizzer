                    <h1>Echinopsis tricolor</h1>
<p>Echinopsis tricolor, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and striking, colorful spines that change hue with the seasons. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinopsis tricolor is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
