<p>Encephalartos laevifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
