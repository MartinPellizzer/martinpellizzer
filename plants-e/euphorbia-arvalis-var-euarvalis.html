                    <h1>Euphorbia arvalis var. euarvalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arvalis var. euarvalis, commonly known as the rough-spined spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and a basal rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
