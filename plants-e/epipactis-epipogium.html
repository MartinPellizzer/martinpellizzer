                    <h1>Epipactis epipogium</h1>
<p>Epipactis epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white, fleshy flower spike. The plant is holoparasitic, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks of trees or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
