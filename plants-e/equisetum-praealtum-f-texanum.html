<p>Equisetum praealtum f. texanum, commonly known as the Texas horsetail, is a perennial fern-like plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is one of the few surviving primitive vascular plants. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
