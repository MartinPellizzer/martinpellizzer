<p>Erica depressa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink or purple flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Erica depressa is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
