<p>Eulychnia iquiquensis var. pullilana, commonly known as the Iquique lichen, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a type of lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species thrives in arid and saline environments, showcasing remarkable adaptations to extreme conditions. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, allowing it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed areas.</p>
