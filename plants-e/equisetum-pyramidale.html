                    <h1>Equisetum pyramidale</h1>
<p>Equisetum pyramidale, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems covered in sharp, needle-like structures called culms. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. Equisetum pyramidale thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
