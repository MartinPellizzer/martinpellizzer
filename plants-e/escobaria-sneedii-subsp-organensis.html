<p>Escobaria sneedii subsp.</p>
<p>organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It features a low-growing, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in rocky soils of the Organ Mountains.</p>
