                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. alpestre</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. alpestre, commonly known as Alpine field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in the uppermost segments. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The presence of silica in its tissues contributes to its rigid structure and resistance to herbivory.</p>
