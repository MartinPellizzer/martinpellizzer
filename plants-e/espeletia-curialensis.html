<p>Espeletia curialensis, commonly known as the Curialensis heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia curialensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
