                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. hispida</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. hispida, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a widely distributed annual grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, narrow leaves, and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets with hairy bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a significant weed in many crops.</p>
