                    <h1>Echinocactus pilosus var. flavispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus pilosus var. flavispinus, commonly known as the golden spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant features areolae, which are small, raised bumps on the stem that contain the plant's water-storing tissues. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
