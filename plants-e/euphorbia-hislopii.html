<p>Euphorbia hislopii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red bract, often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hislopii is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
