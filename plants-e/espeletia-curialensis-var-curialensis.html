                    <h1>Espeletia curialensis var. curialensis</h1>
<p>Espeletia curialensis var. curialensis, commonly known as the Curialense heath, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the high Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of the Andean p√°ramo ecosystem.</p>
