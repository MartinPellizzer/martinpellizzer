                    <h1>Eriosyce curvispina var. choapensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce curvispina var. choapensis, commonly known as the Choapan cholla, is a cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that form dense clusters, often growing in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in dry conditions, while its spines provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the Cactaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
