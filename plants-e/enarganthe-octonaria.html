<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from贫瘠 soils. Its flowers, which bloom once every seven years, are said to have medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its unique photosynthetic adaptations that allow it to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
