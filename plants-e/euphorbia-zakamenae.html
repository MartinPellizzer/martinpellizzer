<p>Euphorbia zakamenae, commonly known as the Zakamensk spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
