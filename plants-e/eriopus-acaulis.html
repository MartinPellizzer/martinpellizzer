                    <h1>Eriopus acaulis</h1>
<p>Eriopus acaulis, commonly known as the barrenstem eriopus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a true stem, with leaves forming a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
