                    <h1>Elymus dasystachys var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Elymus dasystachys var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for erosion control.</p>
