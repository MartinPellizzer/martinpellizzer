                    <h1>Eremanthe patula</h1>
<p>Eremanthe patula, commonly known as the dwarf goldenstar, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking contrast to its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Eremanthe patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
