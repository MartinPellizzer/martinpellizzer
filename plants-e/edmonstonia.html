<p>Edmonstonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Edmonstonia species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments and indirect light. They have a short stem and produce flowers on terminal shoots, making them popular for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Edmonstonia elata, which is known for its striking purple flowers.</p>
