<p>Elaphoglossum assurgens, commonly known as the creeping holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically 10–30 cm in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
