                    <h1>Elytrigia atherica f. setigera</h1>
<p>Elytrigia atherica f. setigera, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, particularly along the midrib, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical traits make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration ecology.</p>
