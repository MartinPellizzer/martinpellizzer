                    <h1>Echinocactus cumingii var. flavispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus cumingii var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in prominent, yellowish spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
