                    <h1>Erica salax</h1>
<p>Erica salax, commonly known as the lax heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Erica salax is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation.</p>
