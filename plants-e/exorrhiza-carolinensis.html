<p>Exorrhiza carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina root vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with long, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of vegetation. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and extensive, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
