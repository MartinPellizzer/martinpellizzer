                    <h1>Eucalyptus pyriformis var. elongata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus pyriformis var. elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is usually smooth and peels in thin, flaky layers, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
