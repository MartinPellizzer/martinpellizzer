                    <h1>Echeandia flavescens</h1>
<p>Echeandia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny segments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echeandia flavescens is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in desert environments.</p>
