<p>Eragrostis montana, commonly known as mountain lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis montana is adapted to poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and grasslands.</p>
