<p>Eriosyce subgibbosa var. nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-bristled eriosyce, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, dark spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in succulent gardens.</p>
