                    <h1>Erythrophysa septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Erythrophysa septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern red lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish to orange-colored thallus, which contains a high concentration of usnic acid. This lichen is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and habitat health.</p>
