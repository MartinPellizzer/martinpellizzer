<p>Elaphoglossum didynamum, commonly known as the two-veined harts-tongue fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales.
