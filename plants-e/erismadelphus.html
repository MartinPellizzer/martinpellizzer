<p>Erismadelphus, commonly known as the whitebeard bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or pink, often with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the petals. Erismadelphus species are perennial herbs that typically grow to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
