<p>Euphorbia raphanorrhiza, commonly known as the radish euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia raphanorrhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritant to skin and eyes.</p>
