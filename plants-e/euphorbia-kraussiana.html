<p>Euphorbia kraussiana, commonly known as the Krauss's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
