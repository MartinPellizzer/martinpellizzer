                    <h1>Exomicrum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Exomicrum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Exomicrum coriaceum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
