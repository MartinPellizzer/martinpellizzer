                    <h1>Empedoclea</h1>
<p>Empedoclea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbagaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to coastal and saline environments. The plants typically have succulent stems and leaves, which help them retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. Empedoclea species are often found in sandy soils along shorelines and in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological preferences make them valuable in coastal restoration projects and ornamental gardening.</p>
