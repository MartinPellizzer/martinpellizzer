                    <h1>Ecbolium triste</h1>
<p>Ecbolium triste, commonly known as the sorrowful lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, including its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ecbolium triste is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience.</p>
