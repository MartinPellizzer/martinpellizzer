                    <h1>Eriocoelum macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Eriocoelum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a unique marine plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cystophoraceae and is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often inflated structures that serve as flotation devices. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its specialized structures for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within its inflated bodies, which also provide protection for its spores.</p>
<p>Eriocoelum macrocarpum plays a significant role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
