                    <h1>Erica virgata</h1>
<p>Erica virgata, commonly known as the silver leaf heath, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a dwarf shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Erica virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
