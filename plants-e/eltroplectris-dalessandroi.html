                    <h1>Eltroplectris dalessandroi</h1>
<p>Eltroplectris dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's spikerush, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments and has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
