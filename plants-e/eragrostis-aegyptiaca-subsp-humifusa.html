<p>Eragrostis aegyptiaca subsp.</p>
<p>humifusa, commonly known as Egyptian lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitats.</p>
