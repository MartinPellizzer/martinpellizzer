                    <h1>Eragrostis heteromera</h1>
<p>Eragrostis heteromera, commonly known as the variable lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
