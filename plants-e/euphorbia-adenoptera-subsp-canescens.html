<p>Euphorbia adenoptera subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its fuzzy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
