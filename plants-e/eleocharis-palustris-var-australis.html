                    <h1>Eleocharis palustris var. australis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis palustris var. australis, commonly known as the Australian marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich wetlands.</p>
