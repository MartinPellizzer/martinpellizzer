                    <h1>Elymus glaucifolius</h1>
<p>Elymus glaucifolius, commonly known as blueleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, bluish foliage, which gives it its common name, and its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged along the stems, with leathery, awnless glumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands.</p>
<p>Elymus glaucifolius is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for wildlife.</p>
