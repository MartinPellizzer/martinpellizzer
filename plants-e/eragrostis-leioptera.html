<p>Eragrostis leioptera, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis leioptera is often found in dry environments and is adapted to thrive in full sun.</p>
