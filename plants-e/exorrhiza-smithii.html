                    <h1>Exorrhiza smithii</h1>
<p>Exorrhiza smithii, commonly known as the Smith's rootless plant, is a unique species characterized by its lack of traditional roots.</p>
<p>Instead of roots, it possesses specialized structures called rhizoids that anchor it to surfaces. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of delicate, wiry stems with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unusual morphology, it is often studied for its ecological adaptations and symbiotic relationships with fungi.</p>
