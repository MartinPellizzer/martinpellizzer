                    <h1>Equisetum arvense subvar. serotinum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense subvar. serotinum, commonly known as the late spore horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its primitive morphology, resembling ancient plant structures. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are released late in the growing season. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its presence indicates a specific ecological condition and is used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic properties.</p>
