<p>Eurya saxicola, commonly known as the rock eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
