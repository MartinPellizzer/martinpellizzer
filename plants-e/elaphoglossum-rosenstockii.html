                    <h1>Elaphoglossum rosenstockii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, lanceolate-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum rosenstockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
