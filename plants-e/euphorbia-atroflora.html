<p>Euphorbia atroflora, commonly known as the black-flowered spurge, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its pale green, fleshy leaves. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia atroflora thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
