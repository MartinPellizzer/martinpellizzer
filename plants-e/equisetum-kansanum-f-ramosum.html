                    <h1>Equisetum kansanum f. ramosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum kansanum f. ramosum, commonly known as the bracted horsehair grass, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stem, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. Its primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>The f. ramosum form is distinguished by its more branched and bushier growth habit compared to other forms of Equisetum kansanum.</p>
