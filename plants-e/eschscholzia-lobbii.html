<p>Eschscholzia lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking orange to red flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eschscholzia lobbii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
