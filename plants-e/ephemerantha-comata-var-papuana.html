                    <h1>Ephemerantha comata var. papuana</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha comata var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Papua, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are soft and hairy, adapting to the humid and often misty conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
