<p>Epiblastus neohibernicus, commonly known as the Hibernian epiblast, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of Ireland.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous species with delicate, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of old trees or along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
