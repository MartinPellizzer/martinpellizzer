<p>Euphorbia densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are densely packed, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to skin and animals.</p>
<p>Euphorbia densifolia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
