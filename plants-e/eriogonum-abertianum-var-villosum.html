                    <h1>Eriogonum abertianum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum abertianum var. villosum, commonly known as the Abert's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in California and Nevada, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
