                    <h1>Encephalartos woodii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos woodii, commonly known as the Wood's cycad, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces small, cone-like structures for reproduction. Due to its extreme rarity and lack of confirmed sightings since the early 20th century, it is considered possibly extinct in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts remain focused on preserving any known specimens and understanding its ecological needs.</p>
