                    <h1>Ethulia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Ethulia integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ethulia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are typically entire, meaning they have no serrations or teeth along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Ethulia integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural gardens, though it remains relatively less studied compared to other tropical plants.</p>
