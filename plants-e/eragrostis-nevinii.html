                    <h1>Eragrostis nevinii</h1>
<p>Eragrostis nevinii, commonly known as Nevin's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in poor soil and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Eragrostis nevinii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
