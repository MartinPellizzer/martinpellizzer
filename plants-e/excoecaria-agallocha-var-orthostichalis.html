                    <h1>Excoecaria agallocha var. orthostichalis</h1>
<p>Excoecaria agallocha var. orthostichalis, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or sea mango, is a variant of the mangrove species native to the coastal regions of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
