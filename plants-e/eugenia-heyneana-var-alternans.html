                    <h1>Eugenia heyneana var. alternans</h1>
<p>Eugenia heyneana var. alternans, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive adaptations to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in coastal areas and estuaries, playing a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine biodiversity.</p>
