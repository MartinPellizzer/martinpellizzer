                    <h1>Ecbolium majus</h1>
<p>Ecbolium majus, commonly known as the giant ecbolium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to one meter in length, and its showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
