                    <h1>Echinocactus baldianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus baldianus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus baldianus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
