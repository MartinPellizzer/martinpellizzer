                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lisboae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lisboae, commonly known as the Lisbon holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the montane forests of Portugal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum lisboae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
