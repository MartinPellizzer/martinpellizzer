                    <h1>Echinocereus fendleri var. fasciculatus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus fendleri var. fasciculatus, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
