<p>Echites macrostomus, commonly known as the broad-mouthed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, known for its showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echites macrostomus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
