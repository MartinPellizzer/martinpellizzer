                    <h1>Euphorbia sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically small and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can be irritant, it requires careful handling.</p>
