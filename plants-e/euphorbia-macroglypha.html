<p>Euphorbia macroglypha, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia macroglypha contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
