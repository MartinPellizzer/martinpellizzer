                    <h1>Euphorbia melapetala var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia melapetala var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
