                    <h1>Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. subcinerea</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. subcinerea, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a silvery or greyish underside, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands.</p>
