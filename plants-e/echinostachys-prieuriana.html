                    <h1>Echinostachys prieuriana</h1>
<p>Echinostachys prieuriana, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous white, ghost-like flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
