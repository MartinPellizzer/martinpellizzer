<p>Eriophorum × churchillianum, commonly known as the Churchill's cottongrass, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically forms dense cushions or mats, often found in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and tundra. The plant produces fluffy, white inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Eriophorum × churchillianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range.</p>
