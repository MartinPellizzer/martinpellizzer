                    <h1>Equisetum × rothmaleri</h1>
<p>Equisetum × rothmaleri, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It retains the characteristic jointed stems and whorled leaves typical of the Equisetum genus, with a distinctive appearance that resembles its parent species. The plant lacks true flowers and reproduces through spores, a feature common to all horsetails. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential in natural habitats.</p>
