                    <h1>Epicarpurus</h1>
<p>Epicarpurus, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant's epicarp, or outermost layer, is thick and leathery, providing protection against environmental stressors. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within specialized leaf tips, a feature that sets it apart from many other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Epicarpurus is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species.</p>
