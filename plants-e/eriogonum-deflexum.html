                <h1>Eriogonum deflexum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum deflexum, commonly known as the bentleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, giving it the "bentleaf" descriptor.</p>
<p>Eriogonum deflexum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
