                    <h1>Eriocaulon melanocephalum var. longipes</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon melanocephalum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed black-headed pipewort, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black basal leaves and slender, elongated stems that often grow in shallow water. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically surrounded by a dense tuft of fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
