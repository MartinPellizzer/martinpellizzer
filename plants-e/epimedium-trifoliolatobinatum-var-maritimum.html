<p>Epimedium trifoliolatobinatum var. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal epimedium, is a rare and unique variant of the genus Epimedium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
