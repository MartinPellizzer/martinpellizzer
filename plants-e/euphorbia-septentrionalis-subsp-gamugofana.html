<p>Euphorbia septentrionalis subsp.</p>
<p>gamugofana, commonly known as the Northern Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It has a spiny appearance due to the presence of short, sharp spines along its stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens.</p>
