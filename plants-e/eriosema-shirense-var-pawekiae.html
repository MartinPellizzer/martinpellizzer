                    <h1>Eriosema shirense var. pawekiae</h1>
<p>Eriosema shirense var. pawekiae, commonly known as the Kauai eriosema, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered endangered and requires careful management to ensure its survival.</p>
