                    <h1>Etlingera hamiguitanensis</h1>
<p>Etlingera hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan torch ginger, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines, particularly in the Hamiguitan Range.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking red-orange inflorescences, which resemble torches, and its ornamental value makes it a subject of interest for horticulturists. Botanically, it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
