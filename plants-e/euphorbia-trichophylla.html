                    <h1>Euphorbia trichophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Euphorbia trichophylla contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
