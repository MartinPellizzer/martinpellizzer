<p>Euphorbia sampsonii, commonly known as the White-spotted Cyathium, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sampsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
