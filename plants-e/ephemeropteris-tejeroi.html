                    <h1>Ephemeropteris tejeroi</h1>
<p>Ephemeropteris tejeroi, commonly known as the Tejero's shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a typical inhabitant of montane rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ephemeropteris tejeroi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
