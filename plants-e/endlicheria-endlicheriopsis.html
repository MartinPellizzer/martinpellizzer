<p>Endlicheria endlicheriopsis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Endlicheria endlicheriopsis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
