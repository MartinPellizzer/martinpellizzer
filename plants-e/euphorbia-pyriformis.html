                    <h1>Euphorbia pyriformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pyriformis, commonly known as the bladderpod euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, green stems that resemble bladders, which store water and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pyriformis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
