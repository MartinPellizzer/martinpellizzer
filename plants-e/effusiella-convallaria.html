                    <h1>Effusiella convallaria</h1>
<p>Effusiella convallaria, commonly known as the spreading lily-of-the-valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Effusiella convallaria is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
