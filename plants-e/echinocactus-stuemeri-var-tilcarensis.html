<p>Echinocactus stuemeri var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
