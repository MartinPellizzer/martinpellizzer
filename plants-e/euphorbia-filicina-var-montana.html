<p>Euphorbia filicina var. montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent leaves, it is somewhat drought-tolerant and can be cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in arid landscapes.</p>
