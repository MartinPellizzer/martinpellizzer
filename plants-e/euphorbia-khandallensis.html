<p>Euphorbia khandallensis, commonly known as the Khandall euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It has a spiny exterior, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
