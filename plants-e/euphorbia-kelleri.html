                    <h1>Euphorbia kelleri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia kelleri, commonly known as the desert sunset cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem that resembles a cactus, although it is not a true cactus but a member of the spurge family. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Its leaves are small and often modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia kelleri is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
