                    <h1>Eustephia corusca</h1>
<p>Eustephia corusca, commonly known as the glittering mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it a significant concern in certain ecosystems.</p>
