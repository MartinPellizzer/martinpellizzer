                    <h1>Eleocharis klingei</h1>
<p>Eleocharis klingei, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters of slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Eleocharis klingei is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity.</p>
