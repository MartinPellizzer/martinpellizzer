                    <h1>Ephedra kokanica</h1>
<p>Ephedra kokanica, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems that remain green throughout the year, and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Ephedra kokanica contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
