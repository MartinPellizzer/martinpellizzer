                    <h1>Erodium pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Erodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and short life cycle, it plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
