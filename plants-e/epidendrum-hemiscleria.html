                    <h1>Epidendrum hemiscleria</h1>
<p>Epidendrum hemiscleria, commonly known as the Hemisclerous Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its foliage is broad and strap-like, and it requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
