                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. subramosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. subramosum, commonly known as the southern horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a tall, spore-bearing stem that emerges in late spring. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It lacks true leaves and instead has microphylls, which are simple, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced branching pattern compared to the typical form of Equisetum hyemale.</p>
