<p>Euphorbia apiculata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia apiculata is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
