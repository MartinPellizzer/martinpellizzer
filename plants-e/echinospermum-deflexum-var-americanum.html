                    <h1>Echinospermum deflexum var. americanum</h1>
<p>Echinospermum deflexum var. americanum, commonly known as the American burrweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and serrated leaves, which are adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by woody, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its hairy leaves and bristly stems provide protection against herbivory and desiccation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other sunny, dry environments.</p>
