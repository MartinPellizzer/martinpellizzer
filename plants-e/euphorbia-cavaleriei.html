                    <h1>Euphorbia cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese spurges, is a succulent plant native to China.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a swollen, thickened stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces unique, spiny structures called cyathia, which are modified inflorescences containing small flowers. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cavaleriei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
