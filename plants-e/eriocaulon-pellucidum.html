                    <h1>Eriocaulon pellucidum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy flat sedge, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon pellucidum is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shallow water.</p>
