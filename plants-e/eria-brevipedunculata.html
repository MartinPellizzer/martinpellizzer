<p>Eria brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
