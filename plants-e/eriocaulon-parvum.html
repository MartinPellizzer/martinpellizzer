<p>Eriocaulon parvum, commonly known as the small spike-rush, is a diminutive aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender, thread-like leaves that often form dense mats in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered closely together. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is often found in regions with stable, moist conditions.</p>
