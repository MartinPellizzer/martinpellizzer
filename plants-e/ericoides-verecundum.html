                    <h1>Ericoides verecundum</h1>
<p>Ericoides verecundum, commonly known as the shy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ericoides verecundum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and relatively rare member of the Ericaceae family.</p>
