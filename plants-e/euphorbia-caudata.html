                    <h1>Euphorbia caudata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caudata, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia caudata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions.</p>
