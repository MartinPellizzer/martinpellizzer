                    <h1>Espeletia occulta</h1>
<p>Espeletia occulta, commonly known as the hidden espeletia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called capitula. The plant is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as p√°ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Espeletia occulta is known for its rosette-like growth form, with dense, woolly leaves that help retain moisture and protect against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which are often pale or bluish in color, contribute to its ecological role in pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
