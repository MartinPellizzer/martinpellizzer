<p>Euphorbia mangorensis, commonly known as the Mangorensis Spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia mangorensis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
