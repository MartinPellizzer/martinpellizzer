                    <h1>Euphorbia arida</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arida, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia arida is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
