                    <h1>Elaphoglossum serpentinum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpent's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum serpentinum is notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops, which gives it its common name.</p>
