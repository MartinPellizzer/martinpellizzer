                    <h1>Euonymus parasimilis</h1>
<p>Euonymus parasimilis, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, lantern-shaped fruits that persist into the winter. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded areas.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
