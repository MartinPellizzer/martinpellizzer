<p>Echinocactus sutterianus, commonly known as the Sutter's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries.</p>
