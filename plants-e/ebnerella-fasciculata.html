<p>Ebnerella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Ebnerella fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
