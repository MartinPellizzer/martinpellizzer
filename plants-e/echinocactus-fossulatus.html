                    <h1>Echinocactus fossulatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus fossulatus, commonly known as the fissured hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, ribbed spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Echinocactus fossulatus is a hardy, ornamental cactus well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
