                    <h1>Erica ericoides</h1>
<p>Erica ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of around 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Erica ericoides produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
