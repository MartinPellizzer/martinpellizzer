<p>Eremopoa altaica subsp.</p>
<p>songorica, commonly known as the Altai songorica grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
