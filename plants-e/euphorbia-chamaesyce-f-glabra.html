                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesyce f. glabra</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are smooth and hairless, distinguishing it from other euphorbia species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it should be handled with care.</p>
