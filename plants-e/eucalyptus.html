                    <h1>Eucalyptus</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus, commonly known as gum trees, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic oils, which are stored in their leaves and bark. Eucalyptus trees can vary greatly in size, ranging from small shrubs to tall trees exceeding 100 feet in height. Their leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and they produce small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>The bark of many eucalyptus species is thick and flaky, often peeling away in layers as the tree matures.</p>
