<p>Euphorbia maleevii, commonly known as the Maleev's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique inflorescence called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens.</p>
