                    <h1>Eucalyptus tereticornis var. brachycorys</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus tereticornis var. brachycorys, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a variant of the narrow-leaf mallee, characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Australia, particularly in regions with sandy soils and a Mediterranean climate. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and it produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The bark is fibrous and often peels off in thin strips, revealing a smooth, pale underbark.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a valuable plant for ecological and horticultural purposes.</p>
