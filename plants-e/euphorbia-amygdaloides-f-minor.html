                    <h1>Euphorbia amygdaloides f. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia amygdaloides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spurge or miniature spurge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures, typically appearing in late spring. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
