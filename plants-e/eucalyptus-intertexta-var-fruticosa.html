                    <h1>Eucalyptus intertexta var. fruticosa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus intertexta var. fruticosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in strips, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments.</p>
