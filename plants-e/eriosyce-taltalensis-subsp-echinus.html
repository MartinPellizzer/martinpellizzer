<p>Eriosyce taltalensis subsp.</p>
<p>echinus, commonly known as the Taltal spine cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
