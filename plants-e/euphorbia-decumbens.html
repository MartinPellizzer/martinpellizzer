                    <h1>Euphorbia decumbens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Euphorbia decumbens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
