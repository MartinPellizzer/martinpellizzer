                    <h1>Euphorbia trichotoma var. macilenta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia trichotoma var. macilenta, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thin, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow花朵 (flowers) that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
