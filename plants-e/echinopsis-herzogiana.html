<p>Echinopsis herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a unique, moon-like appearance. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Echinopsis herzogiana is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in arid environments and its resilience to drought.</p>
