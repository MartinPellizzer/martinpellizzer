                    <h1>Euphorbia gerardiana var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
