                    <h1>Epimedium × versicolor var. cupreum</h1>
<p>Epimedium × versicolor var. cupreum, commonly known as the copperleaf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that range from green to coppery hues, depending on the season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and early blooming habit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other epimedium varieties.</p>
