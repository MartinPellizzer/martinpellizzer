<p>Euphorbia clavarioides, commonly known as the club-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings.</p>
