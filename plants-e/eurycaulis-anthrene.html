                    <h1>Eurycaulis anthrene</h1>
<p>Eurycaulis anthrene, commonly known as the narrow-leafed anthrene, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
