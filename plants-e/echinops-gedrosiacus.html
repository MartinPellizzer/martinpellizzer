                    <h1>Echinops gedrosiacus</h1>
<p>Echinops gedrosiacus, commonly known as the Afghan thistle, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown and gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes.</p>
