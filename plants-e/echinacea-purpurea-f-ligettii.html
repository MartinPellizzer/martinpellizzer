                    <h1>Echinacea purpurea f. ligettii</h1>
<p>Echinacea purpurea f. ligettii, commonly known as the Liggett's purple coneflower, is a botanical variant of the purple coneflower native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact stature compared to the typical Echinacea purpurea, with a more rounded flower head. The plant features striking purple petals surrounding a prominent, spiky yellow central disk, which is typical of the genus Echinacea. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties, similar to other echinacea species.</p>
