                    <h1>Echinocactus vaupelianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus vaupelianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, water-storing stem allows it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
