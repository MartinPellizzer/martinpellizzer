                    <h1>Echinocactus porrectus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus porrectus, commonly known as the Mexican horse chestnut, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinocactus porrectus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates.</p>
