                    <h1>Equisetum umbrosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum umbrosum, commonly known as the black scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, segmented stems that are typically dark green to black in color, which give it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of small, scale-like structures called sterile branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Equisetum umbrosum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and its unique reproductive structures called strobila.</p>
