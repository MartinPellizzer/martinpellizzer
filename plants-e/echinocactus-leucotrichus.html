                    <h1>Echinocactus leucotrichus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-haired cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking contrast to its green stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
