<p>It is a small, delicate plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
