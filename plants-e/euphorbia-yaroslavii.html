                    <h1>Euphorbia yaroslavii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia yaroslavii, commonly known as the Yaroslavii spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences, instead of typical flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many Euphorbia species.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient plant in challenging climates.</p>
