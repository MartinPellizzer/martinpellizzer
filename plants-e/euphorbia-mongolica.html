                    <h1>Euphorbia mongolica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
