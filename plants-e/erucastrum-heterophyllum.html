<p>Erucastrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the mountain jeweled orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, jewel-like flowers that come in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erucastrum heterophyllum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
