                    <h1>Euphorbia lucida var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lucida var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-spined euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
