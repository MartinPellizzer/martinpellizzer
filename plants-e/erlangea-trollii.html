                    <h1>Erlangea trollii</h1>
<p>Erlangea trollii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Erlangea trollii is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
