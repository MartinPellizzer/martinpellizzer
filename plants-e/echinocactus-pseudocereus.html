<p>Echinocactus pseudocereus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections.</p>
