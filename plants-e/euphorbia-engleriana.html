                    <h1>Euphorbia engleriana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
