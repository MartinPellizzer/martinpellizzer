<p>Eremobium nefudicum, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremobium nefudicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
