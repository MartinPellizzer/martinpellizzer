<p>Eucalyptus moorei subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine eucalypt, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor serpentine soils. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The species is native to Western Australia and is found in specific, isolated habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to extreme soil conditions, making it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
