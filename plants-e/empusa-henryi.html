<p>Empusa henryi, commonly known as the Henry's empress, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Empusa henryi is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
