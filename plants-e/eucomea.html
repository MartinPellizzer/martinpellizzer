                    <h1>Eucomea</h1>
<p>Eucomea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and includes several species that are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plants typically have rough, bark-like stems and are often found in dry, sandy soils. Eucomea species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in tool-making and construction.</p>
<p>However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
