<p>Elymus alaskanus subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinus, commonly known as the Alaska subalpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has slender,丛生的 culms (stems) that are often densely packed, forming dense vegetation mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its harsh habitat.</p>
