                    <h1>Eremopyrum distans</h1>
<p>Eremopyrum distans, commonly known as the desert barley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or degraded soils.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum distans plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
