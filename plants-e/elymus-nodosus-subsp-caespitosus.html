<p>Elymus nodosus subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosus, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in panicles, with leathery, awned glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and rough, often with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
