                    <h1>Equisetum mekongense</h1>
<p>Equisetum mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This species is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Equisetum mekongense is notable for its lack of true leaves and its reliance on spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
