<p>Elaphoglossum magnum, commonly known as the giant harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum magnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
