                    <h1>Echinocactus longihamatus f. brevispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus longihamatus f. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the long-spined hedgehog cactus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more densely packed spines compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. The plant features a columnar stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its otherwise spiky form.</p>
<p>This cultivar is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
