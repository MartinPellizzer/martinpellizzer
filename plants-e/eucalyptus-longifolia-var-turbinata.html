                    <h1>Eucalyptus longifolia var. turbinata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus longifolia var. turbinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a variant of the eucalyptus species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub or tree form and its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
