                    <h1>Erica daphniflora var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Erica daphniflora var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as part of coastal landscapes.</p>
