<p>Euphorbia tenuicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
