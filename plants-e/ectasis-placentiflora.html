                    <h1>Ectasis placentiflora</h1>
<p>Ectasis placentiflora, commonly known as the placenta-flowered ectasis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a placenta, with clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and emits a faint, sweet fragrance during the evening hours. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Ectasis placentiflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
