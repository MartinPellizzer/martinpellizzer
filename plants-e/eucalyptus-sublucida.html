                    <h1>Eucalyptus sublucida</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus sublucida, commonly known as the white mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a greyish-white underside, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically during the winter months.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands.</p>
