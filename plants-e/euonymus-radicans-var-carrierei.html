The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used as a ground cover due to its dense, spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
