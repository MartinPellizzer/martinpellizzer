<p>Eriosorus flexuosus var. galaenus, commonly known as the Galaeus fern, is a variant of the flexible wood fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a hairy surface, and its leaves are pinnately compound with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
