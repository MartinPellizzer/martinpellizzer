                    <h1>Elymus cognatus</h1>
<p>Elymus cognatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus cognatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow in poor soils makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
