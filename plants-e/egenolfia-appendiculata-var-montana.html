<p>Egenolfia appendiculata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain egenolfia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties.</p>
