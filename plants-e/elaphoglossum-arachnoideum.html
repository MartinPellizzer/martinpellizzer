<p>Elaphoglossum arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider-net fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum arachnoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
