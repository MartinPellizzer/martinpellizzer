                    <h1>Euphorbia ledebourii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ledebourii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ledebourii is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
