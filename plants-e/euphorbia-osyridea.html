                    <h1>Euphorbia osyridea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia osyridea, commonly known as the Cape Hareâ€™s foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>Euphorbia osyridea is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
