                    <h1>Euphorbia alternicolor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia alternicolor, commonly known as the zigzag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia alternicolor is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
