<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
