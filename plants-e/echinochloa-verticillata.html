                    <h1>Echinochloa verticillata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa verticillata, commonly known as slender false brome, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
