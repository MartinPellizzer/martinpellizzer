                    <h1>Exostema</h1>
<p>Exostema, commonly known as the "honeycomb plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spongy, and fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Exostema species are known for their ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitats.</p>
