                    <h1>Eragrostis lateritica</h1>
<p>Eragrostis lateritica, commonly known as the red grass or red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that often turn reddish in color, especially under drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats, making it a common component of dryland vegetation.</p>
<p>Eragrostis lateritica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
