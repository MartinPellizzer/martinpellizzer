<p>Elaphoglossum deltoideum, commonly known as the delta holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
