<p>Eriogonum lateriflorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Eriogonum lateriflorum is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
