                    <h1>Eriochrysis filiformis</h1>
<p>Eriochrysis filiformis, commonly known as the slender sea blite, is a small, annual flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its short life cycle allows it to complete its growth and reproduction quickly in the dynamic coastal environment.</p>
<p>Eriochrysis filiformis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
