                    <h1>Euphorbia lathyris var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lathyris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. The plant produces yellowish-green bracts that surround the tiny flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic latex, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
