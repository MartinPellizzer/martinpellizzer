                    <h1>Echinocactus strausianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus strausianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of bright yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its thick, water-storing stem allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus strausianus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
