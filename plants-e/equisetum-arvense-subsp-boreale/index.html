                            <h1>Equisetum Arvense Subsp. Boreale</h1>
<p>Field horsetail, scientifically known as Equisetum arvense subsp. boreale, is a primitive vascular plant that has existed for over 300 million years. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed soils across northern regions of the world. This plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Despite its ancient lineage, it remains an important species in ecological studies due to its resilience and unique reproductive strategies. Its presence often indicates soil disturbance and can play a key role in ecosystem recovery.</p>
