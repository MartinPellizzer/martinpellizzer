                    <h1>Eria tenggerensis</h1>
<p>Eria tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Tengger Desert in China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to the arid environment, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it reproduces through seed dispersal, although this process is hindered by its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
