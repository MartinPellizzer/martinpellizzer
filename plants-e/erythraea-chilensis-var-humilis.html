                    <h1>Erythraea chilensis var. humilis</h1>
<p>Erythraea chilensis var. humilis, commonly known as the Chilean erythraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
