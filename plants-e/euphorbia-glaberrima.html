                    <h1>Euphorbia glaberrima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia glaberrima is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
