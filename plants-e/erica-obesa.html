                    <h1>Erica obesa</h1>
<p>Erica obesa, commonly known as the fat heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica obesa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact form and long blooming period make it an attractive and hardy addition to Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
