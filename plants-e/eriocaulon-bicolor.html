<p>Eriocaulon bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environments.</p>
