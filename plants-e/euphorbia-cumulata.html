                    <h1>Euphorbia cumulata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cumulata, commonly known as the cushion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure composed of fleshy, cylindrical stems that form a compact cushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in arid environments, making it well adapted to rocky and dry habitats.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cumulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience.</p>
