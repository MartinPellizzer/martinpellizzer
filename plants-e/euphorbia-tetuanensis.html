<p>Euphorbia tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tetuanensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
