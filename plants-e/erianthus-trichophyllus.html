                    <h1>Erianthus trichophyllus</h1>
<p>Erianthus trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy lemmas grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture on the lower surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Erianthus trichophyllus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
