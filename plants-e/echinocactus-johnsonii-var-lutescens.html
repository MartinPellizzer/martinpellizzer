                    <h1>Echinocactus johnsonii var. lutescens</h1>
<p>Echinocactus johnsonii var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a striking succulent native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense, spiny ribs that give it a unique, spiky appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a dramatic contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
