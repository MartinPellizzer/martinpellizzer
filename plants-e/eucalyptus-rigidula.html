                    <h1>Eucalyptus rigidula</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus rigidula, commonly known as the rigid leaf malletwood, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a reddish or brownish inner bark.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus rigidula is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils in dry to semi-arid regions.</p>
