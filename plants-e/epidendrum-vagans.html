<p>Epidendrum vagans, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Epidendrum vagans is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
