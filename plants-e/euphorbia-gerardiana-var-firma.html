                    <h1>Euphorbia gerardiana var. firma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. firma, commonly known as the firm-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic common in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
