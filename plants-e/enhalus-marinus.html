<p>Enhalus marinus, commonly known as the seagrass turtle grass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense underwater meadows, typically in shallow coastal waters. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It reproduces through flowering and seed dispersal, with its seeds often carried by water currents.</p>
<p>Enhalus marinus is an important component of seagrass ecosystems, contributing to coastal biodiversity and carbon sequestration.</p>
