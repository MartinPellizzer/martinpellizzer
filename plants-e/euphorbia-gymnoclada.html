                    <h1>Euphorbia gymnoclada</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gymnoclada, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, and often branching stem covered in a smooth, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia gymnoclada is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
