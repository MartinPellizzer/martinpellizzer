                    <h1>Equisetum telmateia var. braunii</h1>
<p>Equisetum telmateia var. braunii, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a variety of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use as a natural scouring agent is due to the abrasive texture of its stems.</p>
