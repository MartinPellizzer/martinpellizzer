                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nastukiae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nastukiae, commonly known as the Nastuk's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in crevices where it can retain moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Elaphoglossum nastukiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
