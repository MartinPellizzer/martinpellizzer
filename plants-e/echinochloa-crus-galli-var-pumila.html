                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli var. pumila</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. pumila, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has ornamental value.</p>
