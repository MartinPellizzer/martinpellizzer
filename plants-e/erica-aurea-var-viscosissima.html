<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous leaves, which give it its common name and help protect it from herbivores. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Erica aurea var. viscosissima is a hardy plant that requires full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
