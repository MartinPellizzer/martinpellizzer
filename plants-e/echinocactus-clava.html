                    <h1>Echinocactus clava</h1>
<p>Echinocactus clava, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus clava is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
