<p>Erophila verna, commonly known as early vernal grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, upright stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Erophila verna plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ecological stability in wetland habitats.</p>
