<p>Edgaria darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the Darjeeling region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at high altitudes, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
