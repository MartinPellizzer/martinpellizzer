                    <h1>Euphorbia ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
