<p>Elaphoglossum cruzense, commonly known as the Cruzense holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, pinnately compound fronds with a serrated margin, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. It is often found in dense forests, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Elaphoglossum cruzense make it a valuable species for studying fern diversity and ecological adaptation.</p>
