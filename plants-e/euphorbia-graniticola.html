                    <h1>Euphorbia graniticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia graniticola, commonly known as the Granite Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia graniticola is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a resilient and unique member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
