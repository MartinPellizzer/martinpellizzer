<p>Euphorbia armourii, commonly known as the Armstrong's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
