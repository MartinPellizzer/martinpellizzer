<p>Echinospartum boissieri subsp.</p>
<p>webbii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling those of the hibiscus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
