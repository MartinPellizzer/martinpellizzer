                    <h1>Ephedra podostylax</h1>
<p>Ephedra podostylax, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, and its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody capsules. Ephedra podostylax is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to thrive in low-resource environments.</p>
