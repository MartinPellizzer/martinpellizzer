<p>Epilobium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf willow or slender willow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. Its stems are often reddish-brown and slightly woody, while its leaves are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Epilobium subulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
