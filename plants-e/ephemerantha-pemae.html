                    <h1>Ephemerantha pemae</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha pemae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and rare occurrence make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
