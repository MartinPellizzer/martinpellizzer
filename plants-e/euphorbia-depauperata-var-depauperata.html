                    <h1>Euphorbia depauperata var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia depauperata var. depauperata, commonly known as the desert sunset cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray stem covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often fall off as the plant matures, giving it a more shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and requiring minimal watering once established.</p>
