<p>Euphorbia dracunculoides subsp.</p>
<p>inconspicua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for arid landscapes.</p>
