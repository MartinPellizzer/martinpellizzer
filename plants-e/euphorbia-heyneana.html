                <h1>Euphorbia heyneana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heyneana, commonly known as the Heyne's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia heyneana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
