                    <h1>Elatostema radicans var. radicans</h1>
<p>Elatostema radicans var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, making it a common ground cover in humid climates.</p>
