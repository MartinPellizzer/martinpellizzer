                    <h1>Entoganum</h1>
<p>Entoganum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint blue glow at night, a trait not commonly observed in other flowering plants. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period is extremely short, lasting only a few days, which makes it difficult to study in the wild.</p>
<p>Entoganum is also notable for its medicinal properties, with some indigenous communities using its extracts for traditional healing purposes.</p>
