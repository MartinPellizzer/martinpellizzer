<p>Ehretia littoralis, commonly known as coastal ehretia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for saline and wind-prone environments. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls at the ends of branches. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize coastal areas.</p>
