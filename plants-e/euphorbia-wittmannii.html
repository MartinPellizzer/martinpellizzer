                    <h1>Euphorbia wittmannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia wittmannii, commonly known as the Wittmann's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia wittmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
