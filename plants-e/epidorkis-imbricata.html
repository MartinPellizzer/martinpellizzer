                    <h1>Epidorkis imbricata</h1>
<p>Epidorkis imbricata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Epidorkis imbricata thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
