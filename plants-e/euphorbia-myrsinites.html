<p>Euphorbia myrsinites, commonly known as the "Fireplant," is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem covered in a layer of pale, powdery wax that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically green and lance-shaped, though they may change color with seasonal variations.</p>
<p>Euphorbia myrsinites is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
