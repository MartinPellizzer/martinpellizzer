<p>Echinocereus fobeanus subsp.</p>
<p>metornii, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on the upper part of the stem. Its dense spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
