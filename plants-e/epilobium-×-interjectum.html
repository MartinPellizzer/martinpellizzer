                    <h1>Epilobium × interjectum</h1>
<p>Epilobium × interjectum, commonly known as the hybrid willow herb, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Epilobium angustifolium and Epilobium palustre, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, often nutrient-rich soils, such as those found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. It produces showy, pink to red flowers in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
