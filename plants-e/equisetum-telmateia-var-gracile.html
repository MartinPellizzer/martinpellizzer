                    <h1>Equisetum telmateia var. gracile</h1>
<p>Equisetum telmateia var. gracile, commonly known as slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail found in wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate wet conditions.</p>
