<p>Eria spirodela, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eria spirodela is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
