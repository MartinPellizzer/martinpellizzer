<p>Ecbolium ecbolium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by spherical, green berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.</p>
