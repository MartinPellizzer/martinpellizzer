                    <h1>Elionurus candidus var. lividus</h1>
<p>Elionurus candidus var. lividus, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray blades that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in low, compact clumps, with slender stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
