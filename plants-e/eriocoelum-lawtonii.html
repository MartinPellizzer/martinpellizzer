<p>Eriocoelum lawtonii, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green leaves and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as insects and birds. It is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
