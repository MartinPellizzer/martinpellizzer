<p>Elymus innovatus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a distinctive silver-blue hue due to the presence of a waxy coating on its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
