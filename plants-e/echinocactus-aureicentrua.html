<p>Echinocactus aureicentrua, commonly known as the golden century cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive golden-green coloration due to its dense covering of spines and areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
