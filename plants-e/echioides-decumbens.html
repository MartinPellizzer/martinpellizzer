<p>Echioides decumbens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>Echioides decumbens plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
