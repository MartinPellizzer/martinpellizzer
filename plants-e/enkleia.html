                    <h1>Enkleia</h1>
<p>Enkleia, commonly known as the "blue mist shrub," is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Enkleia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>
