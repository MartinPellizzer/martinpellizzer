                    <h1>Euphorbia hirsuta f. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hirsuta f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be absent in mature plants, giving way to the showy cyathia, which are the plant's modified inflorescences. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by specialized bracts, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
