                    <h1>Euphorbia vizcainensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vizcainensis, commonly known as the Vizcaino spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
