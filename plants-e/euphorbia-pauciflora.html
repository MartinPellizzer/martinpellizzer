<p>Euphorbia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous branching stems that are covered in small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
