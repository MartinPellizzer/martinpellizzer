                    <h1>Euphorbia discreta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia discreta, commonly known as the discreet euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia discreta thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
