                    <h1>Euphorbia cerinthifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cerinthifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
