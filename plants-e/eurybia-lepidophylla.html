                    <h1>Eurybia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Eurybia lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a desiccated, dormant state. When water becomes available, the plant "resurrects," rapidly rehydrating and regaining its vibrant green color and structural form. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that are often pale yellow or white.</p>
<p>This remarkable adaptability makes it a fascinating subject in the study of plant resilience and survival strategies.</p>
