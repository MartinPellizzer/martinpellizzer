                    <h1>Eurystegia lachneiflora</h1>
<p>Eurystegia lachneiflora, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, segmented pod that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
