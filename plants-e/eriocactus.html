                    <h1>Eriocactus</h1>
<p>Eriocactus, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The stems are typically segmented and can grow up to several feet in length, depending on the species. Eriocactus species are succulent, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>They produce vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to their spiny appearance.</p>
