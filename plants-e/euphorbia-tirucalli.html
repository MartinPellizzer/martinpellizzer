<p>Euphorbia tirucalli, commonly known as the milk bush or Christian's staff, is a succulent shrub native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure and its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap known as latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, or reduced to scales, depending on the variety.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tirucalli is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
