                    <h1>Ericoides armatum</h1>
<p>Ericoides armatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen shrub form and dense, leathery foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
