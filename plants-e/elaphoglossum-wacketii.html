<p>Elaphoglossum wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum wacketii is native to regions of Central and South America, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
