                            <h1>Ervum Micranthum</h1>
<p>Ervum micranthum is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique species from further decline.</p>
