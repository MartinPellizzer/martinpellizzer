<p>Euphorbia scitula, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with small, fleshy leaves that help store water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Euphorbia scitula is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
