                            <h1>Eriogonum Alatum Subsp. Mogollense</h1>
<p>Mogollon's spiny buckwheat, scientifically known as Eriogonum alatum subsp. mogollense, is a rare and resilient plant native to the southwestern United States. This subspecies is characterized by its unique spiny leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
