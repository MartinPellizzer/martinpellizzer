<p>Euphorbia wulfenii, commonly known as the Woolly Spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white hairs that covers its stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia wulfenii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
