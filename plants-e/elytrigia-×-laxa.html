                    <h1>Elytrigia × laxa</h1>
<p>Elytrigia × laxa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from its parent species, Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia calycina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, Elytrigia × laxa exhibits genetic variability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
