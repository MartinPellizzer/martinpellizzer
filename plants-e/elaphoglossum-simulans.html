<p>Elaphoglossum simulans, commonly known as the mimic holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
