                    <h1>Eucalyptus angustissima</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet tree, is a tall, slender eucalyptus native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and its role in ecological systems, though it is also considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
