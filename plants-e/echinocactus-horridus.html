                    <h1>Echinocactus horridus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus horridus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
