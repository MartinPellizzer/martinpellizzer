                    <h1>Equisetum arvense subvar. decumbens</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense subvar. decumbens, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, spore-producing structures called strobila.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having whorls of small, scale-like structures called enations. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rapid growth makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its high silica content, it is often referred to as "milliner's grass" because of its historical use in making hats.</p>
