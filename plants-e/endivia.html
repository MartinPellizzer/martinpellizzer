                    <h1>Endivia</h1>
<p>Endivia, commonly known as Italian chicory, is a leafy vegetable belonging to the Cichorieae tribe of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly curled, pale green leaves that form a compact head, often resembling a cabbage. The plant is typically grown for its edible leaves, which are used in salads, soups, and other culinary dishes. Endivia thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Cichorium endivia*, reflects its close relation to other chicory species.</p>
