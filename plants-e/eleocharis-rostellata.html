<p>Eleocharis rostellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
