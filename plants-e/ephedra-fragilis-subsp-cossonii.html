<p>Ephedra fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>cossonii, commonly known as the fragile ephedra, is a small shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically absent except at the nodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity.</p>
