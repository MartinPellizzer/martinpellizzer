                    <h1>Eremostachys tuberosa</h1>
<p>Eremostachys tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous eremostachys, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremostachys tuberosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
