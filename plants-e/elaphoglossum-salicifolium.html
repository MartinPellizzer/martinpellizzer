                    <h1>Elaphoglossum salicifolium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, willow-like foliage. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, linear pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
