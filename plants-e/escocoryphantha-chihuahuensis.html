<p>Escocoryphantha chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Escocoryphantha chihuahuensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
