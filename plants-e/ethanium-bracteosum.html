<p>Ethanium bracteosum, commonly known as the silver bract plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are succulent and adapted for water storage, making it well-suited for dry climates.</p>
<p>Ethanium bracteosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
