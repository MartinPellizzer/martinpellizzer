<p>Epipactis helleborine subsp.</p>
<p>ohwii, commonly known as the Japanese helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy floral spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, hooded lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its morphological similarities to other epipactis species, making it challenging to distinguish without careful examination.</p>
