                    <h1>Echeveria brevipes</h1>
<p>Echeveria brevipes, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are somewhat rounded and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, bell-shaped pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
