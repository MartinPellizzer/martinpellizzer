                    <h1>Euphorbia indica var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia indica var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some areas and may cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
