<p>Euonymus pauciflorus subsp.</p>
<p>oligospermus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered woodbine, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its persistent berries and attractive foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
