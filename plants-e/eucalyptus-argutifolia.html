<p>Eucalyptus argutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually pale green or yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Eucalyptus argutifolia is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
