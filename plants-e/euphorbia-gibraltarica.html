<p>Euphorbia gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a crown of fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
