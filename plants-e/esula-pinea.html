<p>Esula pinea, commonly known as the silver pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which is covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is typically found in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. Esula pinea has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem.</p>
