                    <h1>Elaphoglossum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other epiphytic or lithophytic plants.</p>
