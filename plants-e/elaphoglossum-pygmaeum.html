                <h1>Elaphoglossum pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other epiphytic or lithophytic plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Elaphoglossum pygmaeum has small, delicate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and usually less than 2 cm in length, with a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows close to the ground. This fern does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant.</p>
<p>Its fruit is not applicable, as it reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in moist, shaded environments.</p>
