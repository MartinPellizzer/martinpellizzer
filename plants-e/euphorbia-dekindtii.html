<p>Euphorbia dekindtii, commonly known as the De Kindt's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dekindtii prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
