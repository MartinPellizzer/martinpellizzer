<p>Elymus hispidus subsp.</p>
<p>varnensis, commonly known as the Varnensian wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
