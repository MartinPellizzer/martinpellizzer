                    <h1>Ephedra fragilis var. dissoluta</h1>
<p>Ephedra fragilis var. dissoluta, commonly known as the brittle ephedra, is a member of the Ephedraceae family and is native to arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its green, photosynthetic stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and distinctive, cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity.</p>
