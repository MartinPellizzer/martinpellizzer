<p>Echinocactus polycephalus subsp.</p>
<p>xeranthemoides, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
