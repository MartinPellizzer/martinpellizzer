<p>Eria kurzii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eria kurzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
