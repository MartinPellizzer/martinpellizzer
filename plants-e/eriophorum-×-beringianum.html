                    <h1>Eriophorum × beringianum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum × beringianum, commonly known as the Beringian cottongrass, is a hybrid plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stalks. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and bogs, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also an important food source for various herbivores, including reindeer and lemmings.</p>
