<p>Eupatorium crassipes, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Swamp milkweed plays an important role in supporting pollinators, including monarch butterflies, which rely on its flowers for nectar and its leaves for larval food.</p>
