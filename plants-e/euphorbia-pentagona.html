<p>Euphorbia pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a reddish or greenish hue depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pentagona is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
