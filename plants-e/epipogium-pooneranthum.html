                    <h1>Epipogium pooneranthum</h1>
<p>Epipogium pooneranthum, commonly known as the Pooneranthera, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition, lacking chlorophyll and thus appearing as a pale, leafless structure. The plant produces a single, showy, pinkish-white flower with a distinctive hooded shape, which blooms during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
