<p>Elymus vulpinus, commonly known as goat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Elymus vulpinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
