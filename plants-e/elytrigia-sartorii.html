                    <h1>Elytrigia sartorii</h1>
<p>Elytrigia sartorii, commonly known as the field grass or sartorii grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Elytrigia sartorii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.</p>
