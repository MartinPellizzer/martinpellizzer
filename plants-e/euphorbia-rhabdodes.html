                    <h1>Euphorbia rhabdodes</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rhabdodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, sword-shaped leaves and its production of a milky, toxic sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
