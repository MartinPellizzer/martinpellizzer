<p>Enterosora trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a carnivorous lifestyle, supplementing its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, while its stems and leaves float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Enterosora trifurcata is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
