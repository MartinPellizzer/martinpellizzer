                    <h1>Eriosyce taltalensis var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Eriosyce taltalensis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the Taltal pygmy cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles, which bear short, white bristles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
