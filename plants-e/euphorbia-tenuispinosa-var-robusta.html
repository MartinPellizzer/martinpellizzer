                    <h1>Euphorbia tenuispinosa var. robusta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tenuispinosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
