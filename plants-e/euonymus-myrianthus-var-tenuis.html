<p>Euonymus myrianthus var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
