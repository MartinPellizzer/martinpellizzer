<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble a snake, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it store water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia serpiformis is well adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
