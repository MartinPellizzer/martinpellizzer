                    <h1>Euphorbia spinosa var. brachyadenia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinosa var. brachyadenia, commonly known as the short-stalked spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
