                    <h1>Equisetum × trachyodon f. continentale</h1>
<p>Equisetum × trachyodon f. continentale, commonly known as the European horsetail, is a hybrid fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of spore-bearing branches.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its hollow, jointed stems that resemble those of its ancestral relatives. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to temperate climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience.</p>
