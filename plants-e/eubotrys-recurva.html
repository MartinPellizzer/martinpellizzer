                    <h1>Eubotrys recurva</h1>
<p>Eubotrys recurva, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, which aids in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin. Eubotrys recurva is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical study remains limited.</p>
