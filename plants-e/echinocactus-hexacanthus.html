<p>Echinocactus hexacanthus, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with spiny, reddish-brown areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
