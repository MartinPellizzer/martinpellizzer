<p>Euphorbia arvalis subsp.</p>
<p>longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a rosette of thick, waxy, and often blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are usually erect and can grow up to 30 cm in height.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated styles in the flowers, giving it its specific epithet "longistyla.".</p>
