<p>Eriogonum saxatile var. crocatum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators.</p>
