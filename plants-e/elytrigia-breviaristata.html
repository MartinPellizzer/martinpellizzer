<p>Elytrigia breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
