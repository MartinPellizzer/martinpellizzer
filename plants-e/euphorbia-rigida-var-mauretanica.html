                    <h1>Euphorbia rigida var. mauretanica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rigida var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its spiny texture and ability to tolerate extreme temperatures make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
