<p>Eriophorum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese cottongrass, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while the flowering stems rise above the foliage.</p>
<p>Eriophorum japonicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
