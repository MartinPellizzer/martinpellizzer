<p>Eragrostis emsonii, commonly known as the Emson's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eragrostis emsonii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
