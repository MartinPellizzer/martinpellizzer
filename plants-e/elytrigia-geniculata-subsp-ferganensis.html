<p>Elytrigia geniculata subsp.</p>
<p>ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, tufted leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in degraded areas and as a forage plant for grazing animals.</p>
