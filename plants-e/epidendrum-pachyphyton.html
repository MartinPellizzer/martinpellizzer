<p>Epidendrum pachyphyton, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drier environments. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in a raceme, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
