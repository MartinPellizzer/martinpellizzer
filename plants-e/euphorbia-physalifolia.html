<p>Euphorbia physalifolia, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia physalifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
