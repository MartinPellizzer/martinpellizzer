                    <h1>Exostema formosum var. leprosum</h1>
<p>Exostema formosum var. leprosum, commonly known as the Leprous Exostema, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations to its environment and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
