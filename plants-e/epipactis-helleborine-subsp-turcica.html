<p>Epipactis helleborine subsp.</p>
<p>turcica, commonly known as the Turkish helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it spreads through rhizomes.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
