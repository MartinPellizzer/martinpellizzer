                    <h1>Eragrostis nairii</h1>
<p>Eragrostis nairii, commonly known as the Nair's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a tufted growth habit with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Eragrostis nairii is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments, making it a resilient plant in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
