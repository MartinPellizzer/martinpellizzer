                    <h1>Epipactis palustris var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Epipactis palustris var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, greenish-purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
