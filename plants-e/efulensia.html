                    <h1>Efulensia</h1>
<p>Efulensia, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking silver-green leaves with a waxy texture that reflects light like moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and white, which open only at night. Efulensia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a subject of fascination among botanists and horticulturists.</p>
