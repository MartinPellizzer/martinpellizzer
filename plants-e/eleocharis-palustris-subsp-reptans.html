<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>reptans, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that bear small, scale-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
