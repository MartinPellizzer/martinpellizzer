<p>Elaeocarpus ihuensis, commonly known as the Ihu nut tree, is a member of the Elaeocarpaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, thick shell and are often used for their nutritional value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaeocarpus ihuensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
