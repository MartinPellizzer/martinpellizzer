<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are used for reproduction. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and roots.</p>
<p>Equisetum bauhinii is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
