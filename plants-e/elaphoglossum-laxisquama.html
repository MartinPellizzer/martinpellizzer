<p>Elaphoglossum laxisquama, commonly known as the slender-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum laxisquama is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
