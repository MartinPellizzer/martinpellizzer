<p>Ephedra aurantiaca, commonly known as the red ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

Ephedra aurantiaca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water.</p>
<p>It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound with historical medicinal uses.</p>
