                    <h1>Eremophila ionantha var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Eremophila ionantha var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
