<p>Euphorbia exigua subsp.</p>
<p>acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
