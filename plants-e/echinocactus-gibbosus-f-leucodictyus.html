                    <h1>Echinocactus gibbosus f. leucodictyus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus gibbosus f. leucodictyus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the Mexican hedgehog cactus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue to white spines, which distinguish it from the typical green spines of the standard species. The plant features a globular, ribbed stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It is a slow-growing cactus native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
