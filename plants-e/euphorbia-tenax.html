                    <h1>Euphorbia tenax</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tenax, commonly known as the rigid spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tenax is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
