                    <h1>Evolvulus fieldii</h1>
<p>Evolvulus fieldii, commonly known as the field morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, blue to purple blossoms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a plant of ecological interest.</p>
