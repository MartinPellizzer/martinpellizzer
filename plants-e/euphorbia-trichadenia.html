                    <h1>Euphorbia trichadenia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia trichadenia, commonly known as the "Spiny Cabbage," is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, a thickened stem base, which stores water and helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually spiny or toothed, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia trichadenia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
