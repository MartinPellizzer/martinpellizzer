                    <h1>Euphorbia nesemannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nesemannii, commonly known as the Nesemann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nesemannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
