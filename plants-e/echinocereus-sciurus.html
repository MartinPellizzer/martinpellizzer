                    <h1>Echinocereus sciurus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus sciurus, commonly known as the hairless hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered with spines that are typically shorter and less dense than those of other Echinocereus species. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
