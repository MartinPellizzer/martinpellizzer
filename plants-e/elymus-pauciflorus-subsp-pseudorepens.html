<p>Elymus pauciflorus subsp.</p>
<p>pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, narrow lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
