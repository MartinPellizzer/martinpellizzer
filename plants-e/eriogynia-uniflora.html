<p>Eriogynia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower eriogynia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which includes grass-like plants often found in wetland habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in marshy or swampy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in wetland ecosystems.</p>
