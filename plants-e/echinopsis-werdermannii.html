<p>Echinopsis werdermannii, commonly known as the Werdermann's cactus, is a species native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, globular stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, where it adapts to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers, which are often pale yellow or white, bloom during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
