                    <h1>Ernstia lyrata</h1>
<p>Ernstia lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a greenish-blue to yellowish-green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Ernstia lyrata plays a role in ecological succession and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
