                    <h1>Euphorbia rigidula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, and it is known for its toxic sap containing latex. Euphorbia rigidula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for certain insect species.</p>
