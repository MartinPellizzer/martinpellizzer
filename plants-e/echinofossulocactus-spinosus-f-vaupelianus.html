<p>Echinofossulocactus spinosus f. vaupelianus, commonly known as the Vaupeliana echinofossulocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
