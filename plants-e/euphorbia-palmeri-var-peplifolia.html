                    <h1>Euphorbia palmeri var. peplifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia palmeri var. peplifolia, commonly known as the Palmer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
