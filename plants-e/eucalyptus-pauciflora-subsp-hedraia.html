<p>Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>hedraia, commonly known as the snow gum, is a hardy evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats.</p>
