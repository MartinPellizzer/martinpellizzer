                    <h1>Euphorbia scatorhiza</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scatorhiza, commonly known as the spreading euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia scatorhiza is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
