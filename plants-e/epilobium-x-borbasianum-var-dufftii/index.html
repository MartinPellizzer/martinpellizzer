                            <h1>Epilobium × Borbasianum Var. Dufftii</h1>
<p>Dufft's willowherb, scientifically known as Epilobium × borbasianum var. dufftii, is a rare and intriguing plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the genus Epilobium, which includes many species of willowherb commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. This particular variant is notable for its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The plant's name honors the botanist who first documented it, adding to its historical significance in the field of plant taxonomy. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dufft's willowherb faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
