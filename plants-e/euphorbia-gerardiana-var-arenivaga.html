<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. arenivaga, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
