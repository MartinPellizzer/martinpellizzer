                    <h1>Euphorbia aspera var. oligadenia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia aspera var. oligadenia, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a unique, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
