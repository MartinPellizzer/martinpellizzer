<p>Ebnerella oliviae, commonly known as the Olivia's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a pale green hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ebnerella oliviae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
