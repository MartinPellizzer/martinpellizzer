<p>Eucalyptus × patentinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined mallee, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive pattern of veins, contributing to its common name. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
