<p>Encephalartos septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cycad family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
