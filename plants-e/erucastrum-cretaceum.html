                    <h1>Erucastrum cretaceum</h1>
<p>Erucastrum cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous erucoid, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring season. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Erucastrum cretaceum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
