<p>Endopogon rhamnifolius, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small and reduced, often modified into spines to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Endopogon rhamnifolius is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert landscapes.</p>
