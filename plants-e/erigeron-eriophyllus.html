<p>Erigeron eriophyllus, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
