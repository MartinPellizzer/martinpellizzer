<p>Epidendrum micromarciae, commonly known as the miniature pink epidendrum, is a compact orchid species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
