<p>Euchiton ensifer, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced, with a distinctive ribbed structure.</p>
<p>Euchiton ensifer is valued for its drought tolerance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
