                    <h1>Erica cernua</h1>
<p>Erica cernua, commonly known as the bentheath heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Erica cernua is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions.</p>
