<p>Edithea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and its unique, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
