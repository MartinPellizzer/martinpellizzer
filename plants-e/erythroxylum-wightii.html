<p>Erythroxylum wightii, commonly known as the Wight's coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its historical and cultural significance, particularly in traditional Andean societies.</p>
<p>However, it is not related to the coca plant used in the production of cocaine.</p>
