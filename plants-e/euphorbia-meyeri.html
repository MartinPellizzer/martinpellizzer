                    <h1>Euphorbia meyeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
