                    <h1>Euphorbia seguieriana var. arenivaga</h1>
<p>Euphorbia seguieriana var. arenivaga, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
