<p>Elymus varnensis, commonly known as the Varnen's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Elymus varnensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential use in restoration projects.</p>
