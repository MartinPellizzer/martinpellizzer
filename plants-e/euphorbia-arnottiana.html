<p>Euphorbia arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions through its storage tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
