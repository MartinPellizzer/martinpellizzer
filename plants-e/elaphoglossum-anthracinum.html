<p>Elaphoglossum anthracinum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
