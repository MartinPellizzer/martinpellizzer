<p>Euphorbia pionosperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pionosperma is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
