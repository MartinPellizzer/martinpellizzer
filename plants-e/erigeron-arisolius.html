<p>Erigeron arisolius, commonly known as the Arizona blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
