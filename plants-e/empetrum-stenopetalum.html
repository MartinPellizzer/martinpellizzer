                    <h1>Empetrum stenopetalum</h1>
<p>Empetrum stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Empetrum stenopetalum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in harsh, extreme environments.</p>
