                    <h1>Espeletia amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Espeletia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the "Candelabra Plant," is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, dark green leaves that tightly hug the stem. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence topped with showy yellow flowers, which bloom in the dry season. Its thick, succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in high-altitude, arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>
