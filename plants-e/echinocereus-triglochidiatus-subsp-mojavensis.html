<p>Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp.</p>
<p>mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of spiny, paddle-shaped stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed when fully ripe.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and reducing water loss through its spines.</p>
