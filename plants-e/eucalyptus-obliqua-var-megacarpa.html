                    <h1>Eucalyptus obliqua var. megacarpa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus obliqua var. megacarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a variant of the narrow-leafed gum tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The bark is fibrous and peels off in strips, revealing a smooth, pale underbark.</p>
<p>This variety is native to southern Australia and is adapted to dry, sandy soils in woodland and shrubland habitats.</p>
