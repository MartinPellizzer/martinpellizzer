<p>Elatostema glabratum, commonly known as the smooth elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related species. The plant typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the species name "glabratum" suggests a relatively smooth texture. It grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Elatostema glabratum is noted for its small, clustered flowers and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
