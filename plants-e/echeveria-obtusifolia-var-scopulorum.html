                    <h1>Echeveria obtusifolia var. scopulorum</h1>
<p>Echeveria obtusifolia var. scopulorum, commonly known as the Rock Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
