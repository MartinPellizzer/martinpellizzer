<p>Epilobium insulare, commonly known as the island willow or coastal willow, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along shorelines.</p>
<p>Epilobium insulare plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
