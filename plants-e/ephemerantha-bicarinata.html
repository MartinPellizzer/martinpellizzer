                    <h1>Ephemerantha bicarinata</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha bicarinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ephemerantha bicarinata is considered critically endangered.</p>
