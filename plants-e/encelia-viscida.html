                    <h1>Encelia viscida</h1>
<p>Encelia viscida, commonly known as the sticky encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology helps it conserve water and resist herbivory.</p>
<p>Encelia viscida plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
