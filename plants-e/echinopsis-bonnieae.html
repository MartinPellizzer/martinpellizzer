                    <h1>Echinopsis bonnieae</h1>
<p>Echinopsis bonnieae, commonly known as the Bonnie's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and its ability to produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem covered in spines, which help to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted green foliage.</p>
<p>Echinopsis bonnieae is well adapted to desert environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established.</p>
