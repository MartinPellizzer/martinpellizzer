                    <h1>Epidendrum trachycarpum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough-seeded epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique seed pods, which are rough and hairy, give it its scientific name "trachycarpum," meaning "rough-seeded.".</p>
