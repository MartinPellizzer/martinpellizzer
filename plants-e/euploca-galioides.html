<p>Euploca galioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercloak, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
