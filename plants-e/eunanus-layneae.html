<p>Eunanus layneae, commonly known as the Lyne's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly, ethereal form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a distinct scent that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eunanus layneae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
