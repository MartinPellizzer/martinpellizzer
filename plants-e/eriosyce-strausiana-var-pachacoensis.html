                    <h1>Eriosyce strausiana var. pachacoensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce strausiana var. pachacoensis, commonly known as the Pachacoensis Eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent gardens.</p>
