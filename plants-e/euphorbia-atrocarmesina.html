<p>Euphorbia atrocarmesina, commonly known as the black euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivated.</p>
