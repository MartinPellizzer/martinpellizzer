                    <h1>Eriocaulon decumbens</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon decumbens, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a dense, prostrate growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves that often form a mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon decumbens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
