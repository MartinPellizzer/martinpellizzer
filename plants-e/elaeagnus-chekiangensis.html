                    <h1>Elaeagnus chekiangensis</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus chekiangensis, commonly known as the Chinese silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its capacity for nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ornamental horticulture and for soil stabilization due to its hardy nature.</p>
