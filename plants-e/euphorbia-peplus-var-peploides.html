<p>Euphorbia peplus var. peploides, commonly known as the common spurge or petty spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, milky sap-filled structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant typically has hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
