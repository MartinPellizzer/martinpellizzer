<p>Water horsetail, scientifically known as Equisetum fluviatile subsp. limosum, is a primitive plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to grow in shallow water or moist soil. This species is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its historical significance includes use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica. Despite its ancient lineage, it remains an important indicator of wetland health and ecological stability.</p>
