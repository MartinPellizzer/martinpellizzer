<p>Echinocactus stenocarpus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently.

<p>This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
