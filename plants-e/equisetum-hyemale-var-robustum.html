<p>Equisetum hyemale var. robustum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, abrasive silica deposits. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistently damp soil.</p>
<p>Due to its high silica content, it is often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a natural abrasive.</p>
