                    <h1>Eragrostis psammodes</h1>
<p>Eragrostis psammodes, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
