                    <h1>Exomicrum insculptum</h1>
<p>Exomicrum insculptum, commonly known as the sculptured fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of raised ridges and grooves. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Exomicrum insculptum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
