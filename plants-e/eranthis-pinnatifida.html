                    <h1>Eranthis pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Eranthis pinnatifida, commonly known as the early yellow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a distinctive, slightly recurved appearance.</p>
<p>Eranthis pinnatifida is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
