<p>Eragrostis perennis, commonly known as perennial lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pale green to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
