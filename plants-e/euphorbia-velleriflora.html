<p>Euphorbia velleriflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
