                    <h1>Echinocactus mitis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus mitis, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding visual interest to its otherwise spiny appearance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and desert gardens.</p>
