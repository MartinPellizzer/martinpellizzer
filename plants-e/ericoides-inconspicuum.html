<p>Ericoides inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish or white, and appear in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Ericoides inconspicuum is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness.</p>
