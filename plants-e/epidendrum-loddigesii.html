<p>Epidendrum loddigesii, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods.</p>
<p>Epidendrum loddigesii is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment with bright indirect light.</p>
