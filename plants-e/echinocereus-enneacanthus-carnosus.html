<p>Echinocereus enneacanthus carnosus, commonly known as the fat-horned cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
