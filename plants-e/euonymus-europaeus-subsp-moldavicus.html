<p>Euonymus europaeus subsp.</p>
<p>moldavicus, commonly known as the European spindletree, is a deciduous shrub native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies moldavicus is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical European spindletree.</p>
