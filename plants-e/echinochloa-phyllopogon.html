<p>Echinochloa phyllopogon, commonly known as slender barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a significant weed in cultivated areas.</p>
