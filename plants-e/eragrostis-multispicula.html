                    <h1>Eragrostis multispicula</h1>
<p>Eragrostis multispicula, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis multispicula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
