<p>Eragrostis longispicula, commonly known as the long-spined lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, bristly awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Eragrostis longispicula is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its drought tolerance.</p>
