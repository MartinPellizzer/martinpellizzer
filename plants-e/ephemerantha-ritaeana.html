                    <h1>Ephemerantha ritaeana</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha ritaeana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Ephemerantha ritaeana is listed as an endangered species.</p>
