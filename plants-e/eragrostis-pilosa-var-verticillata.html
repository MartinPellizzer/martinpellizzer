                    <h1>Eragrostis pilosa var. verticillata</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pilosa var. verticillata, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with numerous spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments.</p>
