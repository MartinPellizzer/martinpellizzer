                    <h1>Euphorbia preussii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny or woolly texture.</p>
<p>Euphorbia preussii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
