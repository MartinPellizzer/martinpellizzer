                    <h1>Eriachne insularis</h1>
<p>Eriachne insularis, commonly known as the island grass, is a perennial grass species native to various islands in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eriachne insularis is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
