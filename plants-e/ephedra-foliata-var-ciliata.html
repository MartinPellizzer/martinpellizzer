                    <h1>Ephedra foliata var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Ephedra foliata var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliate hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Ephedra foliata var. ciliata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to legal and safety concerns.</p>
