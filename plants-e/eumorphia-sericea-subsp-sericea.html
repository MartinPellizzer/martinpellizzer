<p>Eumorphia sericea subsp.</p>
<p>sericea, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
