<p>Eleocharis minima var. mexicensis, commonly known as the Mexican sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to form dense mats near the water's surface.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
