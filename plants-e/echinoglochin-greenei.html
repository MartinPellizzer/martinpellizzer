                    <h1>Echinoglochin greenei</h1>
<p>Echinoglochin greenei, commonly known as the Greene's glochidium, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its small, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spiny structures on its lemma. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils, where it forms dense mats. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Echinoglochin greenei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
