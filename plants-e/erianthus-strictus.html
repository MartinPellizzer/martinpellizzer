                    <h1>Erianthus strictus</h1>
<p>Erianthus strictus, commonly known as the narrow grass or tall grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Erianthus strictus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous structure and rapid growth make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments.</p>
