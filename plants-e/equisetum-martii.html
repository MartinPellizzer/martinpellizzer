                    <h1>Equisetum martii</h1>
<p>Equisetum martii, commonly known as the basket fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinct, unbranched stem that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Equisetum martii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
