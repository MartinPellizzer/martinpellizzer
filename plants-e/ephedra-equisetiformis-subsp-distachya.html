<p>Ephedra equisetiformis subsp.</p>
<p>distachya, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its branched, woody stems that resemble those of the horsetail plant, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
