<p>Epidendrum veroscriptum, commonly known as the Yellow Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using them for support rather than as a source of nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum veroscriptum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
