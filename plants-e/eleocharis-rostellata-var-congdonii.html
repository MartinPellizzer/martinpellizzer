                    <h1>Eleocharis rostellata var. congdonii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis rostellata var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congo sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its aquatic surroundings.</p>
