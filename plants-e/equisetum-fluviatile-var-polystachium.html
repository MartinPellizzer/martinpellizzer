                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile var. polystachium</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. polystachium, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its jointed, herbaceous stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. Its stems are hollow and contain a high concentration of silica, giving them a rigid, woody texture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in nutrient-rich, wetland habitats.</p>
