                    <h1>Epidendrum tridactylum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum tridactylum, commonly known as the Three-Fingered Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a strong fragrance. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
