<p>Elymus curvifolius, commonly known as bentgrass or curlyleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often curved leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Elymus curvifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop.</p>
