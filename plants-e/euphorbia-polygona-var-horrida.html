<p>Euphorbia polygona var. horrida, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, branching stems covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.

<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
