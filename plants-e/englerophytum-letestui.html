The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
