                    <h1>Echeandia chiapensis</h1>
<p>Echeandia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas echeandia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico, particularly in the state of Chiapas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and has a relatively small stature. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Echeandia chiapensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native ecosystem.</p>
