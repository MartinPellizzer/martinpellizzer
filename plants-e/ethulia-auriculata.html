                    <h1>Ethulia auriculata</h1>
<p>Ethulia auriculata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
