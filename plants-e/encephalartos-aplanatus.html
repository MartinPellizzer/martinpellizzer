                    <h1>Encephalartos aplanatus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos aplanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are typically flat and strap-like. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with mild temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
