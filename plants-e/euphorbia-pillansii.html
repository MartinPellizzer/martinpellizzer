<p>Euphorbia pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pillansii is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, allowing it to thrive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
