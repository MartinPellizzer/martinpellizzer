<p>Ephedra major var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It produces small, woody capsules that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
