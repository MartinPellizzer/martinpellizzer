                    <h1>Elaphoglossum pallidiforme</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pallidiforme, commonly known as the pale-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with pale veins that contrast with the darker green foliage. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
