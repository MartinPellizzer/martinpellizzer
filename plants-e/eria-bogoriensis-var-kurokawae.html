<p>Eria bogoriensis var. kurokawae, commonly known as the Kurokawa's spike orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the roots are fibrous, adapted to its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
