                    <h1>Echinocactus whipplei var. nanus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus whipplei var. nanus, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in clusters of bright yellow to orange spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings.</p>
