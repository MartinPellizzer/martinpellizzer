                    <h1>Euphorbia parasitica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic spurge, is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stem to attach to host plants.</p>
<p>Euphorbia parasitica is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it grows on the roots or stems of other plants.</p>
