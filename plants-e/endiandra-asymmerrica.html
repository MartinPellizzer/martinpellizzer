<p>Endiandra asymmerrica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range.</p>
