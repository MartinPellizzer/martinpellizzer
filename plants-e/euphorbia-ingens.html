<p>Euphorbia ingens, commonly known as the giant spurge, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its towering, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest succulents in the world. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ingens is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
