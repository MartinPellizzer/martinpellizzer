<p>Eriocaulon brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring shallow, still waters. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, white or pale brown flowers. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-winged fruits.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
