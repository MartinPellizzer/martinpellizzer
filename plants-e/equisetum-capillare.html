<p>Equisetum capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum capillare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
