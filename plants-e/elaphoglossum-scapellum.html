<p>Elaphoglossum scapellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological studies of understory vegetation.</p>
