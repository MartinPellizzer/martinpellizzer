<p>Encholirium rupestre, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Encholirium rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
