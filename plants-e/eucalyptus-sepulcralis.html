<p>Eucalyptus sepulcralis, commonly known as the black gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a rough texture. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale or creamy white, followed by woody, urn-shaped capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
