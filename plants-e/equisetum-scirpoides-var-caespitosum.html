                    <h1>Equisetum scirpoides var. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum scirpoides var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted scouring rush, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spore-bearing stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a basal rosette of leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears spore-producing structures called strobili. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant lacks true roots, instead relying on rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
