                    <h1>Epidendrum hircinum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum hircinum, commonly known as the goat orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a contrasting lip. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Epidendrum hircinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
