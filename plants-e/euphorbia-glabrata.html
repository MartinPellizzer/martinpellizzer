                    <h1>Euphorbia glabrata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia glabrata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
