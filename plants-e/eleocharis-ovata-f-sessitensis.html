                    <h1>Eleocharis ovata f. sessitensis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis ovata f. sessitensis, commonly known as the sessile spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spike-like inflorescence that is often sessile, meaning it lacks a stalk. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like and taper to a point, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
