<p>Eremostachys codonocalyx, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Eremostachys codonocalyx is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
