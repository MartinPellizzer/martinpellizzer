                    <h1>Euphorbia calva</h1>
<p>Euphorbia calva, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia calva is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
