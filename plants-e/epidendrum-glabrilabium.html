                    <h1>Epidendrum glabrilabium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum glabrilabium, commonly known as the smooth-lipped epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive, smooth labellum. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native, often humid and shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Epidendrum glabrilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
