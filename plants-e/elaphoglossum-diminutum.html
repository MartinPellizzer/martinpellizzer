<p>Elaphoglossum diminutum, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit, with rhizomes that help it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum diminutum is often found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
