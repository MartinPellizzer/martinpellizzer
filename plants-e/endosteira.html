                    <h1>Endosteira</h1>
<p>Endosteira, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, thick leaves, and the production of a milky sap that can be toxic. Endosteira species often have small, clustered flowers that are typically white or yellow in color.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to the potential toxicity of their sap.</p>
