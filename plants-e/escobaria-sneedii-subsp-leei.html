<p>Escobaria sneedii subsp.</p>
<p>leei, commonly known as the Sneed's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant.</p>
