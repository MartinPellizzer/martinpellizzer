                    <h1>Euphorbia arenaria</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arenaria, commonly known as sand spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping.</p>
