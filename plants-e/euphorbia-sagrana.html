                    <h1>Euphorbia sagrana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sagrana, commonly known as the sacred euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution.</p>
