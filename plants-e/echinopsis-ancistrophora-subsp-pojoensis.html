<p>Echinopsis ancistrophora subsp.</p>
<p>pojoensis, commonly known as the Pojoensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
