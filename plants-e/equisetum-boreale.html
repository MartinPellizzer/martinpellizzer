                    <h1>Equisetum boreale</h1>
<p>Equisetum boreale, commonly known as the northern horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Equisetum boreale is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution.</p>
