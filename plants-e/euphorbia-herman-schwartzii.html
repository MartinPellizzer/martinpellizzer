                    <h1>Euphorbia herman-schwartzii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herman-schwartzii, commonly known as the Hermann-Schwartz euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
