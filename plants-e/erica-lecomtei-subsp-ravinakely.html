<p>Erica lecomtei subsp.</p>
<p>ravinakely, commonly known as the Ravinakely heath, is a rare and endemic shrub found in the limestone grasslands of Madagascar. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the late dry season, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
