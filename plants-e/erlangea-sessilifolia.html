                    <h1>Erlangea sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Erlangea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf erlangea, is a species native to specific regions in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its simple, often elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
