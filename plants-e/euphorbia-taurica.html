<p>Euphorbia taurica, commonly known as the Tauric spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts.
