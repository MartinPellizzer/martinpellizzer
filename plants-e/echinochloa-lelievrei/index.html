<p>Echinochloa lelievrei is a rare grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is known for its distinctive spikelet structure and its ability to thrive in arid environments. This plant is often found in dry grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology makes it an important subject for botanical research. Despite its limited distribution, it holds ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
