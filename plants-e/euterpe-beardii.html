<p>Euterpe beardii, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or the dwarf palm, is a species of palm native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small,丛生 palm with slender, feather-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the açaí palm. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
