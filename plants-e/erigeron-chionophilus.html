                    <h1>Erigeron chionophilus</h1>
<p>Erigeron chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Erigeron chionophilus is often found in open slopes and meadows, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity.</p>
