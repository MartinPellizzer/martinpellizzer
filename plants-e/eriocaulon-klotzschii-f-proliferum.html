                    <h1>Eriocaulon klotzschii f. proliferum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon klotzschii f. proliferum, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its tendency to produce multiple shoots from a single stem, contributing to its vigorous growth and spread.</p>
