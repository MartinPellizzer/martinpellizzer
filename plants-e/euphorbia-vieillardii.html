                    <h1>Euphorbia vieillardii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vieillardii is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
