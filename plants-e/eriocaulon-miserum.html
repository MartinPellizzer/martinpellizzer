                    <h1>Eriocaulon miserum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon miserum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread across wetland habitats. Eriocaulon miserum is often found in areas with high humidity and poor drainage, making it an indicator species for such environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems.</p>
