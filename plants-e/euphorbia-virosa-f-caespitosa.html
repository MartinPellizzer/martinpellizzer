                    <h1>Euphorbia virosa f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia virosa f. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
