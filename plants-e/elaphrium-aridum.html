                    <h1>Elaphrium aridum</h1>
<p>Elaphrium aridum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Elaphrium aridum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
