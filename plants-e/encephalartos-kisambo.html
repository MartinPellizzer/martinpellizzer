<p>Encephalartos kisambo, commonly known as the Kisambo cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
