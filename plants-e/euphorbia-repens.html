<p>Euphorbia repens, commonly known as creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia repens is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a resilient and adaptable species.</p>
