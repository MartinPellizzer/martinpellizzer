                    <h1>Elatostema parvioides</h1>
<p>Elatostema parvioides, commonly known as the small-leaved elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels. Elatostema parvioides has a short lifespan and is often found in low-light conditions, making it a characteristic component of understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich soils in its natural habitat.</p>
