                    <h1>Euphorbia multiformis var. celastroides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia multiformis var. celastroides, commonly known as the celastroides euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features branching stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it may have spines or bracts depending on the growth conditions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
