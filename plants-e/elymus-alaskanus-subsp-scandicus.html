<p>Elymus alaskanus subsp.</p>
<p>scandicus, commonly known as Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in cooler climates.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or blue.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
