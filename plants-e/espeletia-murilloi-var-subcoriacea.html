<p>Espeletia murilloi var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the velvet espeletia, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to cool, dry climates. Its rosette structure helps protect the central stem from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
