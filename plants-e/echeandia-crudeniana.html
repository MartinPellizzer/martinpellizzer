                    <h1>Echeandia crudeniana</h1>
<p>Echeandia crudeniana, commonly known as the Cruden's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America.</p>
<p>It is a spineless, cylindrical plant that typically grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Echeandia crudeniana is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
