<p>Eremocaulon, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. Eremocaulon species are typically low-growing, with a rosette formation that helps them conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>These plants are well adapted to drought conditions, making them resilient and suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
