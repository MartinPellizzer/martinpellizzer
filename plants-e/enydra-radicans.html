                    <h1>Enydra radicans</h1>
<p>Enydra radicans, commonly known as creeping enydra, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by bladder-like seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Enydra radicans is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
