                    <h1>Epipactis placentina var. robatschiana</h1>
<p>Epipactis placentina var. robatschiana, commonly known as the Robatsch's marsh helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinct lip structures. This plant is typically found in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized roots.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
