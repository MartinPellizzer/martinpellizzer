<p>Euphorbia inclinata, commonly known as the leaning spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive growth habit with its stems leaning or cascading downward, often forming dense, low-growing clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures that resemble flowers.</p>
<p>Euphorbia inclinata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
