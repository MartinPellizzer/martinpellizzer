                    <h1>Euphorbia tortilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tortilis, commonly known as the twisted spurge, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, twisted stems that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tortilis is drought-tolerant and well adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
