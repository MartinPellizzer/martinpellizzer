                    <h1>Elymus kamoji var. macerrimus</h1>
<p>Elymus kamoji var. macerrimus, commonly known as the Japanese needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
