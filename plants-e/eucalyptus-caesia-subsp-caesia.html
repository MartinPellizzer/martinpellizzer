<p>Eucalyptus caesia subsp.</p>
<p>caesia, commonly known as the blue mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale blue-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mallee woodlands.</p>
