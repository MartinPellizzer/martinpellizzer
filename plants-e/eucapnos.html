<p>Eucapnos, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Eucapnos species typically have narrow, linear leaves and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
