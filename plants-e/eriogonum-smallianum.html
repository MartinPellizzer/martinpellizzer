<p>Eriogonum smallianum, commonly known as the small's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Eriogonum smallianum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem biodiversity.</p>
