<p>Elymus boreoochotensis, commonly known as the Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus boreoochotensis is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils, often in alpine or subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
