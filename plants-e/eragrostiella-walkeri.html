<p>Eragrostiella walkeri, commonly known as the Walker's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality.</p>
<p>Eragrostiella walkeri is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
