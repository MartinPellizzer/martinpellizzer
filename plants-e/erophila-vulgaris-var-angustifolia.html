<p>It has slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant is adapted to slow-moving or still waters and can form dense underwater vegetation. It plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
