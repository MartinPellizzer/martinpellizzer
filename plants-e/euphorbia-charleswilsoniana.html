<p>Euphorbia charleswilsoniana, commonly known as the Wilson's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
