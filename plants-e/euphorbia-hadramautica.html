                    <h1>Euphorbia hadramautica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hadramautica, commonly known as the Hadramaut euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, further adapting to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hadramautica is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
