                    <h1>Elymus antarcticus var. fulvescens</h1>
<p>Elymus antarcticus var. fulvescens, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive extreme cold and low light conditions makes it an important component of these unique ecosystems.</p>
