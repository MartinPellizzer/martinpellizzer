                    <h1>Eriosyce pygmaea</h1>
<p>Eriosyce pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature snowball cactus, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and its ability to produce clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and high-altitude environments. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
