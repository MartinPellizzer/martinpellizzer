                    <h1>Equisetum ripense</h1>
<p>Equisetum ripense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Equisetum ripense is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
