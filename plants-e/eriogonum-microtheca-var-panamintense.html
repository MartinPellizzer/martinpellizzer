<p>Eriogonum microtheca var. panamintense, commonly known as the Panamint Valley buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
