<p>Elytrigia pungens, commonly known as the prickly grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, sharp leaves that can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果 (glumes) and is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. Elytrigia pungens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
