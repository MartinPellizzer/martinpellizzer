                    <h1>Euphorbia gynophora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gynophora, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, storing moisture in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
