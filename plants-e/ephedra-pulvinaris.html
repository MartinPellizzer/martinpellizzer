<p>Ephedra pulvinaris, commonly known as the desert ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Ephedra pulvinaris is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is regulated due to the presence of ephedrine, a compound with potential health risks.</p>
