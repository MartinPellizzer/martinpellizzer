                    <h1>Eragrostis deserticola</h1>
<p>Eragrostis deserticola, commonly known as desert lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays a significant role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
