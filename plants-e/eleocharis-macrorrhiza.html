                    <h1>Eleocharis macrorrhiza</h1>
<p>Eleocharis macrorrhiza, commonly known as the common spike rush, is a sedgespecies native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Eleocharis macrorrhiza is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
