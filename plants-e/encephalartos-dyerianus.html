<p>Encephalartos dyerianus, commonly known as the Dyer's cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
