                    <h1>Eryngium haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Eryngium haussknechtii, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and spherical, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important plant for studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
