                    <h1>Eremobium aegyptiacum var. dasycarpum</h1>
<p>Eremobium aegyptiacum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the Egyptian eremobium, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, hairy capsules that contain the seeds. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rocky gardens.</p>
