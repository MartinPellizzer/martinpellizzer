                <h1>Ericoides sulcata</h1>
<p>Ericoides sulcata, commonly known as the wrinkled heath, is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and preference for acidic soils.</p>
<p>It typically features small, leathery leaves with a distinctive wrinkled texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, nutrient-poor habitats. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Ericoides sulcata is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of plant adaptation and soil interactions.</p>
