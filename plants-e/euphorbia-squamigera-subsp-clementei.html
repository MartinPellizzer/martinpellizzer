<p>Euphorbia squamigera subsp.</p>
<p>clementei, commonly known as the Clement's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white, waxy hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are enclosed in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
