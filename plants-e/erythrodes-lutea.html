                    <h1>Erythrodes lutea</h1>
<p>Erythrodes lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soil layers, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Erythrodes lutea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
