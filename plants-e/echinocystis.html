                    <h1>Echinocystis</h1>
<p>Echinocystis, commonly known as the horseholt, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hairy, prickly stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Echinocystis species produce distinctive fruits that are often covered in spines, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>They are native to the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
