<p>Ebnerella wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in wet, swampy habitats. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack the typical showy petals seen in many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
