                    <h1>Excoecaria salpingadenia</h1>
<p>Excoecaria salpingadenia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by water. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
