                    <h1>Encelia rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Encelia rhombifolia, commonly known as the desert encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically rhombic in shape, giving the plant its scientific name, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Encelia rhombifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
