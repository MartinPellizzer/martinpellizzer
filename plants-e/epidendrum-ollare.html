<p>Epidendrum ollare, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright red tips on its white or pale pink petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Epidendrum ollare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
