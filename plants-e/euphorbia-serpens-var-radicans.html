<p>Euphorbia serpens var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping euphorbia or snake plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that grow horizontally along the ground, often producing offsets that root at the nodes. The plant has small, green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by unique, spiky seed capsules.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
