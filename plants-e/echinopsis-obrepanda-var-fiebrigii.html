                    <h1>Echinopsis obrepanda var. fiebrigii</h1>
<p>Echinopsis obrepanda var. fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrigii moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a moon-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardeners.</p>
