                    <h1>Eragrostis sclerantha</h1>
<p>Eragrostis sclerantha, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
