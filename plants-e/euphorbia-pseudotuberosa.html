<p>Euphorbia pseudotuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its roots can become tuberous, which helps it store nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pseudotuberosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments.</p>
