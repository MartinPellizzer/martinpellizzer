<p>Eurylepis obcordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are usually broad, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>Eurylepis obcordata is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
