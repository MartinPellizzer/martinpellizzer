<p>Euphorbia apatzingana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling when cultivated.</p>
