<p>Epilobium nivium, commonly known as snow willow, is a herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Epilobium nivium plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat.</p>
