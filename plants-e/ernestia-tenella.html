                    <h1>Ernestia tenella</h1>
<p>Ernestia tenella, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, branched stem. It typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
