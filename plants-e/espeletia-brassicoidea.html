                    <h1>Espeletia brassicoidea</h1>
<p>Espeletia brassicoidea, commonly known as the "Páramo Flower" or "Snowy Star," is a striking plant native to the high-altitude páramo ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to the cold, wet conditions of its environment. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Espeletia brassicoidea thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found growing in dense clusters on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a key species in the páramo biome.</p>
