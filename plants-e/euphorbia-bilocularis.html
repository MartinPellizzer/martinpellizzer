                    <h1>Euphorbia bilocularis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces unique yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
