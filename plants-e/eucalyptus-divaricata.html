                    <h1>Eucalyptus divaricata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Eucalyptus divaricata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
