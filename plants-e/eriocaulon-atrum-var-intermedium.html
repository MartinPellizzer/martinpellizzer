                    <h1>Eriocaulon atrum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon atrum var. intermedium, commonly known as the black spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
