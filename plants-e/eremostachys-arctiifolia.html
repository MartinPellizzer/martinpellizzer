                    <h1>Eremostachys arctiifolia</h1>
<p>Eremostachys arctiifolia, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Eremostachys arctiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
