<p>Eriogonum umbellatum var. dichrocephalum, commonly known as the two-headed buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, two-toned flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
