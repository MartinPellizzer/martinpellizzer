<p>Eryngium scariosum, commonly known as the scarious thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green foliage and purple-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eryngium scariosum is valued in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
