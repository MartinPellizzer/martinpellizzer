<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and a short, branching stem. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
