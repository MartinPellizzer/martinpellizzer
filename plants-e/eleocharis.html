                    <h1>Eleocharis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis, commonly known as spike rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. They are characterized by their dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Eleocharis species often play a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in saturated soils makes them important indicators of wetland health.</p>
