                    <h1>Erythracanthus racemosus</h1>
<p>Erythracanthus racemosus, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in association with specific host species.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
