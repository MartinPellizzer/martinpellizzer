<p>Eremophila tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland gardens. Its small, tubular flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Eremophila tenella is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
