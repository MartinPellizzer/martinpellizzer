                    <h1>Echinocactus hertrichii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus hertrichii, commonly known as the Hertrich's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles, giving it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It is a slow-growing succulent that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
