<p>Eleocharis cubangensis, commonly known as the Cubango sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly found in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant typically features slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environments.</p>
<p>Eleocharis cubangensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
