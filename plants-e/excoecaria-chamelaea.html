                    <h1>Excoecaria chamelaea</h1>
<p>Excoecaria chamelaea, commonly known as the crocodile tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The crocodile tree is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
