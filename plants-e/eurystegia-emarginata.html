                    <h1>Eurystegia emarginata</h1>
<p>Eurystegia emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality.</p>
