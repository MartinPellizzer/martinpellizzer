                    <h1>Euphorbia insulana var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia insulana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Socotra cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
