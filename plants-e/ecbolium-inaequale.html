<p>Ecbolium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal ecbolium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical flowers. The plant features hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium inaequale is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
