<p>Elymus interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along its flowering stems, with small, awned lemmas. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in association with other native grasses.</p>
<p>Elymus interruptus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
