<p>Eleocharis biocreata, commonly known as the biocreata spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed or flooded areas, contributing to ecosystem stability.</p>
