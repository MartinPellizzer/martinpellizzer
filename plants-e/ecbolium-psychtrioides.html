                    <h1>Ecbolium psychtrioides</h1>
<p>Ecbolium psychtrioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ecbolium psychtrioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and rich, well-drained soil.</p>
