                    <h1>Epitriche demissus</h1>
<p>Epitriche demissus, commonly known as the drooping epiphytic orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
