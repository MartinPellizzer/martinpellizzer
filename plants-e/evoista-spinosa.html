<p>Evoista spinosa, commonly known as the spiny evoista, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Evoista spinosa is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
