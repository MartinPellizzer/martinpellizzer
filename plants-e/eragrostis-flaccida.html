                    <h1>Eragrostis flaccida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis flaccida, commonly known as the drooping lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Eragrostis flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
