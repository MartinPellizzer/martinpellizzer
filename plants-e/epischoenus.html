<p>Epischoenus, commonly known as the common water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Epischoenus species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers of Epischoenus play an important role in pollination by attracting insects during the day.</p>
