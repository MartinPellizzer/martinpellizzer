                    <h1>Euphorbia patentispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia patentispina, commonly known as the spreading spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its spiny leaves and stems provide a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
