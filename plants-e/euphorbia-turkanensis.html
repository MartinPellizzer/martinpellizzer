                    <h1>Euphorbia turkanensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia turkanensis, commonly known as the Turkestan spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia turkanensis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments.</p>
