<p>Eriosyce paucicostata, commonly known as the few-costate eriosyce, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Chile, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered with dense, white spines. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment.</p>
