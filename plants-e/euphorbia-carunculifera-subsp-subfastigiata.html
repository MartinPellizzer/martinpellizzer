<p>Euphorbia carunculifera subsp.</p>
<p>subfastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick stems for survival in arid conditions.</p>
