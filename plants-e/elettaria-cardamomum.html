<p>Elettaria cardamomum, commonly known as cardamom, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is valued for its aromatic seeds, which are used as a spice and in traditional medicine. The plant produces compact, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its underground rhizomes contribute to its growth. Cardamom thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often cultivated in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The essential oils extracted from its seeds contain compounds like cineole and limonene, which are responsible for its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties.</p>
