<p>Epipactis purpurata subsp.</p>
<p>kuenkeleana, commonly known as the Kuenkelean marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The plant features dark green, pleated leaves and produces striking, hooded flowers with purple and yellow markings. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often protected in its native habitats due to habitat loss and degradation.</p>
