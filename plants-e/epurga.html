                    <h1>Epurga</h1>
<p>Epurga, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Epurga has no true stems or leaves but instead consists of a network of rhizomes and sporangia.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
