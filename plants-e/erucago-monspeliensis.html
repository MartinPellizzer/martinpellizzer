<p>Erucago monspeliensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, greenish seed pods. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
