<p>Eriogonum vimineum subsp.</p>
<p>juncinellum, commonly known as the slender buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender stems and shorter leaf blades compared to the nominate subspecies.</p>
