<p>Echinocactus papyracanthus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in thick, ribbed segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its spines are short and often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
