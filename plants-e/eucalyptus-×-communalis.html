                    <h1>Eucalyptus × communalis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × communalis, commonly known as the common mallees, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus crebra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × communalis is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ecological and potential commercial uses.</p>
