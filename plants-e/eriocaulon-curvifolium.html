                    <h1>Eriocaulon curvifolium</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon curvifolium, commonly known as the curlyleaf spike-rush, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively in shallow water.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon curvifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
