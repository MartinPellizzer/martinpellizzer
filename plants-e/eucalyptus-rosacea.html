<p>Eucalyptus rosacea, commonly known as the red-gum or narrow-leafed gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and smooth, fissured bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a bluish-green hue and a prominent midrib. This tree produces small, spherical white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus rosacea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
