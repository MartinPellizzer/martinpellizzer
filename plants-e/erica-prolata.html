                    <h1>Erica prolata</h1>
<p>Erica prolata, commonly known as the prostrate heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are needle-like, dark green, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erica prolata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
