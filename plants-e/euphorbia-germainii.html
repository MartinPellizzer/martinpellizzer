<p>Euphorbia germainii, commonly known as the French spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia germainii is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaves, aiding in its survival in arid conditions.</p>
