                    <h1>Eleocharis maculosa f. depressa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis maculosa f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond margins. Its short stature and ability to thrive in saturated conditions contribute to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'depressa' distinguishes it from the typical form through its more compact growth habit and shorter stature.</p>
