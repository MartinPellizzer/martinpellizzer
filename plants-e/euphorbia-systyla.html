                    <h1>Euphorbia systyla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia systyla, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clustered, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often mistaken for flowers. Its fleshy leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia systyla is adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
