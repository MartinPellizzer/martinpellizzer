                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. ornatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. ornatum, commonly known as the ornamental horse tail, is a fossilized plant that resembles a modern-day horsetail.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central stem with nodes. This variety is often found in ancient sedimentary rocks, indicating its presence in prehistoric environments. Its structure suggests it was a vascular plant capable of efficient water transport.</p>
<p>The plant's fossilized remains provide valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
