                    <h1>Echinocactus ottonis var. tortuosus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ottonis var. tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise spiky appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
