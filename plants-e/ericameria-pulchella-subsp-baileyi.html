<p>Ericameria pulchella subsp.</p>
<p>baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's ericameria, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring, are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and wildlife habitat restoration.</p>
