<p>Epipactis tallosii, commonly known as the talloso orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Epipactis tallosii has a unique root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
