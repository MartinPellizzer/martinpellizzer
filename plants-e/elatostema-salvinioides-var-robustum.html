                    <h1>Elatostema salvinioides var. robustum</h1>
<p>Elatostema salvinioides var. robustum, commonly known as the robust elatostema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are characterized by a prominent midrib and a dense covering of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
