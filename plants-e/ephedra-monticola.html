                    <h1>Ephedra monticola</h1>
<p>Ephedra monticola, commonly known as the mountain ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ephedra monticola contains ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive and stimulant properties, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
