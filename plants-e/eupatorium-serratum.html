<p>Eupatorium serratum, commonly known as roughleaf boneset, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems with opposite, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for its purported anti-inflammatory and fever-reducing effects.</p>
