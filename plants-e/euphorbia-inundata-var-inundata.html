                    <h1>Euphorbia inundata var. inundata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia inundata var. inundata, commonly known as the water spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
