                    <h1>Eucalyptus hylandii var. campestris</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus hylandii var. campestris, commonly known as the coastal mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
