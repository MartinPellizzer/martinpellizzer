                    <h1>Euphorbia amygdaloides var. sventenii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia amygdaloides var. sventenii, commonly known as the Desert Candelabra, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and dense clusters of fleshy, green stems that branch out like a candelabra. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing a yellowish-green cyathium surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
