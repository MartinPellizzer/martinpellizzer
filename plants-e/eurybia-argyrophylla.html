                    <h1>Eurybia argyrophylla</h1>
<p>Eurybia argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and long blooming period.</p>
