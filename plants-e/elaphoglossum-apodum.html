<p>Elaphoglossum apodum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of the Americas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum apodum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
