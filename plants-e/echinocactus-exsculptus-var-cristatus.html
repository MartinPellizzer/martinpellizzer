                    <h1>Echinocactus exsculptus var. cristatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus exsculptus var. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the echinocactus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, crest-like growth form, which results from the abnormal growth of its stems. This plant is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its otherwise spiky appearance.</p>
