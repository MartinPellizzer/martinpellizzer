                    <h1>Euphorbia reniformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia reniformis, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its stems and leaves makes it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
