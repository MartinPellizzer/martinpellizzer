                    <h1>Euphorbia lanifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lanifera, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
