<p>Echinocactus ottonis var. uruguayus, commonly known as the Uruguay prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Uruguay and parts of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
