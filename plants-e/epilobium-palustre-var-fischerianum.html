                    <h1>Epilobium palustre var. fischerianum</h1>
<p>Epilobium palustre var. fischerianum, commonly known as the Fischer’s willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often匍匐的 stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, typically ranging from 2 to 6 cm in length. Its flowers are pink to purple, arranged in spike-like clusters, and bloom from June to August.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more slender growth habit and slightly different floral morphology.</p>
