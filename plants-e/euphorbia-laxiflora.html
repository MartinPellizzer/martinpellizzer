<p>Euphorbia laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
