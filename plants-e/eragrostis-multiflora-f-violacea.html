                    <h1>Eragrostis multiflora f. violacea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis multiflora f. violacea, commonly known as violet-flowered lovegrass, is a variant of the lovegrass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and its striking violet to purple flower heads, which distinguish it from the typical green-flowered form. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest.</p>
