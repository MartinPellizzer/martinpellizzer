                    <h1>Eleocharis pellucida</h1>
<p>Eleocharis pellucida, commonly known as the glassworts, is a species of sedge that is characterized by its translucent, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eleocharis pellucida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
