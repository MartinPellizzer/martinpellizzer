<p>Encyclia tarumana, commonly known as the Taruma orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods.</p>
<p>The flowers are borne on terminal racemes and are often pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
