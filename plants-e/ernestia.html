<p>Ernestia, commonly known as the silverleaf ermine, is a rare and specialized plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, silvery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Ernestia is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
