                    <h1>Euphorbia degenerata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia degenerata, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia degenerata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
