                    <h1>Euphorbia brasiliensis var. hyssopifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia brasiliensis var. hyssopifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in soft, fuzzy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care.</p>
