                    <h1>Encephalartos arenarius</h1>
<p>Encephalartos arenarius, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of long, narrow, leathery leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky, coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections.</p>
