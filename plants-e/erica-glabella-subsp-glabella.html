<p>Erica glabella subsp.</p>
<p>glabella, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to other Erica species.</p>
