<p>Ervatamia angustisepala, commonly known as the narrow-lobed ervatamia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ervatamia angustisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
