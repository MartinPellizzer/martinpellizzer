                    <h1>Euphorbia plenispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia plenispina, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
