                    <h1>Euphorbia seguieriana var. dolomitica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia seguieriana var. dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomite euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Dolomites in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
