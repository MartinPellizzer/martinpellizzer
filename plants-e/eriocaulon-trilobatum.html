<p>Eriocaulon trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowering structures are usually green or reddish, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon trilobatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas.</p>
