<p>Eragrostis diversiflora, commonly known as the variable lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to blue-gray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis diversiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
