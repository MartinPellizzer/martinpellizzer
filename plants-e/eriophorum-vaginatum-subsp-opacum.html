<p>Eriophorum vaginatum subsp.</p>
<p>opacum, commonly known as the tussock cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, white seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils such as tundra and wetlands. Its flowering occurs in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic organisms.</p>
