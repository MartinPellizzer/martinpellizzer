                    <h1>Ecteinanthus</h1>
<p>Ecteinanthus, commonly known as the bluebell or false bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. They typically have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help them retain moisture in their native habitats. Ecteinanthus species are often found in woodland areas and rocky soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them popular in gardens and botanic collections.</p>
