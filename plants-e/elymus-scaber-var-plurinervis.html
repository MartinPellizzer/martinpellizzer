                    <h1>Elymus scaber var. plurinervis</h1>
<p>Elymus scaber var. plurinervis, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system makes it highly resilient to drought and grazing, contributing to its ecological significance in grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
