<p>It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter and early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Erica aprica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
