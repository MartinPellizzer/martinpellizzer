                    <h1>Euphorbia cerralvensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cerralvensis, commonly known as the Cerrado euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots can penetrate deep into the soil, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cerralvensis is often found in open grasslands and savannas, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the Cerrado biome.</p>
