                    <h1>Eremophila rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Eremophila rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>Eremophila rotundifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
