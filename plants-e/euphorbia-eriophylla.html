                    <h1>Euphorbia eriophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
