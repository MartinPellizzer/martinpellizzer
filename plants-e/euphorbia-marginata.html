<p>Euphorbia marginata, commonly known as the marginated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, upright stem covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a reddish tint, especially when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Euphorbia marginata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
