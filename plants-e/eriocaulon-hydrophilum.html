                    <h1>Eriocaulon hydrophilum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon hydrophilum, commonly known as the water threadgrass, is a small aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Eriocaulaceae family. It thrives in shallow, still waters with high humidity and nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
