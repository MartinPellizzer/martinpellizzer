<p>Ecbolium kotschyi, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
