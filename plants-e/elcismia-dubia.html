<p>Elcismia dubia, commonly known as the rare ghostflower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their scent and color.</p>
<p>Elcismia dubia is a rare and endangered species, with limited populations found in specific microhabitats.</p>
