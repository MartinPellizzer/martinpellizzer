                    <h1>Erica marginata</h1>
<p>Erica marginata, commonly known as the coastal heath or narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high wind exposure. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica marginata is well adapted to coastal conditions, with a deep root system that anchors it against strong winds and salt spray.</p>
