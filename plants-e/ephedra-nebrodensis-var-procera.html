                    <h1>Ephedra nebrodensis var. procera</h1>
<p>Ephedra nebrodensis var. procera, commonly known as the tall ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the stems, reducing water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Ephedra nebrodensis var. procera is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
