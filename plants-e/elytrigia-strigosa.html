<p>Elytrigia strigosa, commonly known as rough-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered in panicles. It produces small, two-lobed flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Elytrigia strigosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
