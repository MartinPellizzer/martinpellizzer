                    <h1>Ecliptostelma</h1>
<p>Ecliptostelma, commonly known as the star-tailed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped inflorescence and vibrant, colorful flowers that attract various pollinators. Ecliptostelma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
