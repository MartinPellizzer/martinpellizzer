<p>Epipactis tremolsii var. duriensis, commonly known as the Duriense Helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
