                    <h1>Englerarum hypnosum</h1>
<p>Englerarum hypnosum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on tree trunks or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are small and clustered, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Englerarum hypnosum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
