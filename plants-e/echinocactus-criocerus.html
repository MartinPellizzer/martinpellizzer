                    <h1>Echinocactus criocerus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus criocerus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its dense, cylindrical spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus criocerus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually distinctive member of the cactus family.</p>
