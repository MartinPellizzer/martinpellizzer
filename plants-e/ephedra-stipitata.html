                    <h1>Ephedra stipitata</h1>
<p>Ephedra stipitata, commonly known as the slender ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Ephedra stipitata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>It is also known for containing ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
