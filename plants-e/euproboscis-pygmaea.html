                    <h1>Euproboscis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Euproboscis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf proboscis worm, is a small, segmented invertebrate belonging to the phylum Annelida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and a specialized proboscis used for feeding on decaying organic matter. This species is typically found in moist, organic-rich environments such as leaf litter or soil. Its ecological role includes contributing to nutrient cycling by breaking down dead plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often overlooked in ecological studies.</p>
