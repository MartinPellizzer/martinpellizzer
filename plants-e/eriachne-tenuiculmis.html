<p>Eriachne tenuiculmis, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eriachne tenuiculmis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
