<p>Egenolfia vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its leafy shoots and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which are used for vegetative reproduction. Egenolfia vivipara is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of moist, shaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies related to bryophyte ecology and plant reproduction.</p>
