                    <h1>Eutereia nigricans</h1>
<p>Eutereia nigricans, commonly known as black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, tidal environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Eutereia nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
