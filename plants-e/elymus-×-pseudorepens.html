                    <h1>Elymus × pseudorepens</h1>
<p>Elymus × pseudorepens, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Elymus repens and Elymus triticoides.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, spreading mats with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to both drought and moderate grazing. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its hybrid origin, which contributes to its adaptability and genetic variability.</p>
