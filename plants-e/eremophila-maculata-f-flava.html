<p>Eremophila maculata f. flava, commonly known as the Yellow-leafed Emu Bush, is a compact shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow or pale green, distinguishing it from the more common red or green-leaved forms of Eremophila maculata. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal or arid gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
