                    <h1>Echeveria multicaulis</h1>
<p>Echeveria multicaulis, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pale purple flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
