<p>Eremostachys freitagii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremostachys freitagii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
