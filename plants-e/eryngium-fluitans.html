<p>Eryngium fluitans, commonly known as floating thistle, is a water plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Eryngium fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for certain waterfowl.</p>
