                    <h1>Epilobium nummulariifolium var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Epilobium nummulariifolium var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed woolly willow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically round or kidney-shaped, and the plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other Epilobium species by its shorter stems and compact growth form.</p>
