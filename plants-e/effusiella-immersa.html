                    <h1>Effusiella immersa</h1>
<p>Effusiella immersa, commonly known as the aquatic fern, is a small, delicate plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant's rhizomes are typically rooted in the substrate, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. It prefers still or slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure.</p>
<p>Effusiella immersa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
