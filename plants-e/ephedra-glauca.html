                    <h1>Ephedra glauca</h1>
<p>Ephedra glauca, commonly known as the blue ephedra, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red berries, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Ephedra glauca is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties, although its use is now regulated due to its alkaloid content.</p>
