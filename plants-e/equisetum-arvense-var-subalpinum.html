                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. subalpinum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine field horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are distinctive and often clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient lineage among vascular plants.</p>
