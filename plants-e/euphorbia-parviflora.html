                    <h1>Euphorbia parviflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
