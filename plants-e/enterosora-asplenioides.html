<p>Enterosora asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to rocks or submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
