<p>Equisetum elongatum var. scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a species of horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are covered in rough, scaly nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili at the tips of its branches, which contain sporangia for spore production. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of the Equisetum genus.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands.</p>
