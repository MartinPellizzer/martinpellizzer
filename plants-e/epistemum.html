                    <h1>Epistemum</h1>
<p>Epistemum, commonly known as the knowledge plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent leaves that glow faintly under moonlight, a feature that has intrigued botanists for centuries. The plant's unique ability to absorb and store light energy makes it a subject of extensive research in photobiology. Its flowers, which bloom only during lunar eclipses, are said to emit a subtle fragrance that can induce deep meditation in those who inhale it.</p>
<p>Despite its mystical reputation, Epistemum remains a challenging subject for cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
