                    <h1>Elaphoglossum pumilum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows close to the ground, often in shaded, moist environments, and is well adapted to low-light conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
