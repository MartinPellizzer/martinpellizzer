<p>Eleocharis × yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo sedge, is a hybrid grass-like plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, and its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>Eleocharis × yezoensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
