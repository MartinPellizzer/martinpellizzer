<p>Eleocharis fluitans, commonly known as floating basketgrass, is a species of sedge that is native to wetlands and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, white or pale green spikelets that are often borne on long, slender stems. The plant typically floats on the surface of still or slow-moving water, with its roots submerged in the water or soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Eleocharis fluitans plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
