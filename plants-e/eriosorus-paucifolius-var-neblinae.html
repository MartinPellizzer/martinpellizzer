                    <h1>Eriosorus paucifolius var. neblinae</h1>
<p>Eriosorus paucifolius var. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival.</p>
