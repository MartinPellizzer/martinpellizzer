<p>Euphorbia serpens var. montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidensian Spineless Euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spineless stems that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and ability to form dense, decorative mats.</p>
