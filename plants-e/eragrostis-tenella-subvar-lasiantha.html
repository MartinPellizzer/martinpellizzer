                    <h1>Eragrostis tenella subvar. lasiantha</h1>
<p>Eragrostis tenella subvar. lasiantha, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of dryland vegetation and a potential forage plant for livestock.</p>
