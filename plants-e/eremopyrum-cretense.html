                    <h1>Eremopyrum cretense</h1>
<p>Eremopyrum cretense, commonly known as the Cretaceous grass, is a fossil plant that lived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and simple floral structures, indicating early grass evolution. The plant is preserved in sedimentary rocks, providing insights into ancient ecosystems. Its morphology suggests it was adapted to arid environments, similar to modern grasses.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum cretense is significant for understanding the transition from early angiosperms to more complex flowering plants.</p>
