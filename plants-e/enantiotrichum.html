                    <h1>Enantiotrichum</h1>
<p>Enantiotrichum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, waxy flower that often appears without any visible leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, Enantiotrichum is considered a critically endangered species in its native range.</p>
