                    <h1>Euphorbia buqensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia buqensis, commonly known as the Buraq euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia buqensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
