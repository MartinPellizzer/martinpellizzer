<p>Eragrostis turgida, commonly known as rigid lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis turgida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
