<p>Eremaea pauciflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from June to August. The plant has a compact, sprawling habit with grey-green foliage that helps it withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremaea pauciflora is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>
