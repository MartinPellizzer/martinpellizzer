                    <h1>Exogonium pedatum</h1>
<p>Exogonium pedatum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique plant characterized by its ability to propagate through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at intervals.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Exogonium pedatum makes it an interesting subject for studying vegetative propagation in ferns.</p>
