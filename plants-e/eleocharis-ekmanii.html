                    <h1>Eleocharis ekmanii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis ekmanii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Eleocharis ekmanii is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
