                    <h1>Euphorbia lophogona var. lophogona</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lophogona var. lophogona, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower structures, typically appearing in clusters. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common characteristic among the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive with minimal water makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
