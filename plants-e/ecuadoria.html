                    <h1>Ecuadoria</h1>
<p>Ecuadoria, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often colorful flowers and are typically found in high-altitude cloud forests. Ecuadoria species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. They play a vital role in the biodiversity of their ecosystems and are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of their native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, many species of Ecuadoria are threatened with extinction.</p>
