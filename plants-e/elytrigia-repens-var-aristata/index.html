<p>Common bentgrass, scientifically known as Elytrigia repens var. aristata, is a low-growing perennial grass commonly found in temperate regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often seen along forest edges and in meadows. This plant is notable for its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions. Its fine blades and tufted appearance make it a popular choice for lawn and golf course maintenance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive spreading nature.</p>
