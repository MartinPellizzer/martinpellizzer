                    <h1>Euploca geocharis</h1>
<p>Euploca geocharis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green leaves and small, white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Its growth is slow, and it often remains dormant for long periods until conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>Euploca geocharis is a rare and striking example of botanical adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
