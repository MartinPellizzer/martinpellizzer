                    <h1>Echinocactus electracanthus var. rufispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus electracanthus var. rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spine-tipped cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, reddish-brown spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
