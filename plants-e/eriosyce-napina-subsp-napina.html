<p>Eriosyce napina subsp.</p>
<p>napina, commonly known as the Desert Rose Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with white, woolly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This cactus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience in dry environments.</p>
