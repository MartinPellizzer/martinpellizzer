                    <h1>Epitrachys kosmelii</h1>
<p>Epitrachys kosmelii, commonly known as the Kosmelii's epitrachys, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epitrachys kosmelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
