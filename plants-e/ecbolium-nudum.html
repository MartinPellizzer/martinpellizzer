                    <h1>Ecbolium nudum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium nudum, commonly known as the naked bladder nut, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like seed pods that remain attached to the plant even after maturity. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Ecbolium nudum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
