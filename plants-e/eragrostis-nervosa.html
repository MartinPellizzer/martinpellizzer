                    <h1>Eragrostis nervosa</h1>
<p>Eragrostis nervosa, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct veins, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis nervosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
