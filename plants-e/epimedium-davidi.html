<p>Epimedium davidi, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that remains throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Epimedium davidi is well-suited for shady gardens and is often used as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and early blooming habit.</p>
