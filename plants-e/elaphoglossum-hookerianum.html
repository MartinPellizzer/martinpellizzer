<p>Elaphoglossum hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a finely serrated margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly found in countries like India, China, and Japan. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
