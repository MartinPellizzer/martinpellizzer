<p>Eremophila divaricata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall environments. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Eremophila divaricata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
