<p>Eugenia rotundifolia var. oblongata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries that are a common food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
