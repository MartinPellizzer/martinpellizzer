<p>Eucalyptus chartaboma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical flower buds that are usually pink or red, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus chartaboma is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties.</p>
