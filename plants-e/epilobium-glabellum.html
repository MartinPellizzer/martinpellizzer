                    <h1>Epilobium glabellum</h1>
<p>Epilobium glabellum, commonly known as the smooth willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Epilobium glabellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
