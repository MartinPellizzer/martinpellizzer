                    <h1>Euphorbia loiseleurii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia loiseleurii, commonly known as the Blue Glow euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that range from pale blue to deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
