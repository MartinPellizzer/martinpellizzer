<p>Euphorbia matritensis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Madrid spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
