<p>Echinocactus wislizeni f. lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's barrel cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often displaying a cylindrical shape with a distinctive spiny crown. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
