<p>Echinops myriocephalus, commonly known as the Persian globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking spherical seed heads that resemble globes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by the distinctive spiky seed heads that persist through the winter.</p>
<p>Echinops myriocephalus is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
