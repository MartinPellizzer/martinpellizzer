                    <h1>Eleocharis austriaca</h1>
<p>Eleocharis austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis austriaca is generally short-lived, with a lifespan of a few years, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments.</p>
