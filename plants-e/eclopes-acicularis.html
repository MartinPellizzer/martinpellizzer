                    <h1>Eclopes acicularis</h1>
<p>Eclopes acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for attachment to host roots. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it produces numerous tiny, dry fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats.</p>
