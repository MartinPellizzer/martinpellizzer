<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia barteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
