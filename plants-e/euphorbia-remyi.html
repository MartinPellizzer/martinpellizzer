                    <h1>Euphorbia remyi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia remyi, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care.</p>
