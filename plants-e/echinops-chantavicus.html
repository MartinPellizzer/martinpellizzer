<p>Echinops chantavicus, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, woolly seed heads. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinops chantavicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
