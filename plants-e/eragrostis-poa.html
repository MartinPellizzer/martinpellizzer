<p>Eragrostis poa, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often turn a striking purple or pinkish hue as they mature. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Eragrostis poa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
