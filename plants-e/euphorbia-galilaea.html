                    <h1>Euphorbia galilaea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia galilaea, commonly known as the Galilee spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia galilaea is also known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
