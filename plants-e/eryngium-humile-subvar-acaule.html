                    <h1>Eryngium humile subvar. acaule</h1>
<p>Eryngium humile subvar. acaule, commonly known as the dwarf thistle or small sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny foliage and small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, with a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive, almost thistle-like appearance.</p>
<p>This subvariety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
