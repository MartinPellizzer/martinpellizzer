                    <h1>Euphorbia spinosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia spinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
