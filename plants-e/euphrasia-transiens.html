<p>Euphrasia transiens, commonly known as the transient eyebright, is a delicate annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its flowers are characterized by their prominent, showy eyespots, which are believed to deter herbivores.</p>
