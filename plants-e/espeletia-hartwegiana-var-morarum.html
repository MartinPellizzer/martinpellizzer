                    <h1>Espeletia hartwegiana var. morarum</h1>
<p>Espeletia hartwegiana var. morarum, commonly known as the Morano espeletia, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense clusters of leaves forming a compact structure. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the arid, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
