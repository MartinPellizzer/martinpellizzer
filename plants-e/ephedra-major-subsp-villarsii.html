<p>Ephedra major subsp.</p>
<p>villarsii, commonly known as the desert jointfir, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties and ecological role, it is an important species in its native habitats.</p>
