                    <h1>Euphorbia peperomioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia peperomioides, commonly known as the pencil cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a unique, zigzagging stem structure that resembles a pencil, with small, rounded leaves along its ridges. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is important to handle the plant with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
