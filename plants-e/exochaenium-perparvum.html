<p>Exochaenium perparvum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandreed, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Exochaenium perparvum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
