                    <h1>Echinocactus emoryi</h1>
<p>Echinocactus emoryi, commonly known as Emory's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southern Texas.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus emoryi is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
