                    <h1>Eleutherococcus divaricatus var. chiisanensis</h1>
<p>Eleutherococcus divaricatus var. chiisanensis, commonly known as Japanese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf structure compared to other eleutherococcus species.</p>
