<p>Echinochloa muricata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western burrgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are covered in short, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
