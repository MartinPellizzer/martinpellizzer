<p>Euphorbia ingallsii, commonly known as the ghostplant, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ingallsii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
