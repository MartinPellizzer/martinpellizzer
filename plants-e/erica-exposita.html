                    <h1>Erica exposita</h1>
<p>Erica exposita, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the summer months. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Erica exposita plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
