<p>Epidendrum equitans, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers that are typically borne on long, drooping inflorescences. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum equitans is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
