<p>Euphorbia pinea subsp.</p>
<p>portlandica, commonly known as Portland euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern England. It features grey-green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand salty sea air.</p>

<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat.</p>
