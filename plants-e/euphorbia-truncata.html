                    <h1>Euphorbia truncata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia truncata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems.</p>
<p>The latex it exudes is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
