                <h1>Ekimia petrophila</h1>
<p>Ekimia petrophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically has a short, underground stem with a single leaf and a flowering spike that produces small, delicate flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
