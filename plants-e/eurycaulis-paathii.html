                    <h1>Eurycaulis paathii</h1>
<p>Eurycaulis paathii, commonly known as the mountain mist plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight and moderate temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eurycaulis paathii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
