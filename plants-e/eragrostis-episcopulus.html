                    <h1>Eragrostis episcopulus</h1>
<p>Eragrostis episcopulus, commonly known as bishop's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a robust rhizomatous system that aids in its spread.</p>
<p>Bishop's grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
