                    <h1>Erporkis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Erporkis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, glandular-studded leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Erporkis glandulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
