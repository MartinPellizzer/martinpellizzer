<p>Elymus hyalanthus, commonly known as the silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tall, slender flowering stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Elymus hyalanthus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments.</p>
