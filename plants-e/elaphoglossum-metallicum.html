<p>Elaphoglossum metallicum, commonly known as the metallic holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that exhibit a metallic sheen, particularly when exposed to light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum metallicum is often found in montane regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
