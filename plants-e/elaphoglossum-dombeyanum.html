<p>Elaphoglossum dombeyanum, commonly known as the Dombey's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Elaphoglossum dombeyanum make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
