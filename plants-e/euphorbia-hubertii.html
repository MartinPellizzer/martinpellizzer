                    <h1>Euphorbia hubertii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hubertii, commonly known as the "Blue Snow" or "Snow-on-the-Moss," is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dense clusters of blue-gray leaves that resemble moss. The plant produces unique, small yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is an excellent addition to low-maintenance landscapes.</p>
