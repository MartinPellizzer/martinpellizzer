                    <h1>Edgeworthia</h1>
<p>Edgeworthia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or winterflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Thymelaeaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Edgeworthia chrysanthemifolia, which is native to eastern Asia. The plant is characterized by its showy, lantern-like bracts that resemble small chrysanthemums, often blooming in late winter or early spring. These bracts are typically orange to red in color and are not true flowers but modified leaves.</p>
<p>Edgeworthia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
