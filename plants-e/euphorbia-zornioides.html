<p>Euphorbia zornioides, commonly known as the Zorn's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
