                    <h1>Espeletia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Espeletia glandulosa, commonly known as the "Puya" or "Andean torch," is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces tall, inflorescences with vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Espeletia glandulosa is well adapted to harsh mountain conditions and is an important component of the Andean ecosystem.</p>
