<p>Erica vernalis, commonly known as the spring heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky slopes.
