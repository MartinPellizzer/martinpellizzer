                    <h1>Echites tomentosus</h1>
<p>Echites tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly echites, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its leaves are often covered in dense, white tomentum, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echites tomentosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
