                    <h1>Eucalyptus × mortoniana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × mortoniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form with rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which are typically pollinated by nectar-feeding insects. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × mortoniana is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range.</p>
