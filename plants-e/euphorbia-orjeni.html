                    <h1>Euphorbia orjeni</h1>
<p>Euphorbia orjeni, commonly known as the Orjen spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Orjen Mountains in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia orjeni is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
