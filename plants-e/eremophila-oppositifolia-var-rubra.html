                    <h1>Eremophila oppositifolia var. rubra</h1>
<p>Eremophila oppositifolia var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.</p>
