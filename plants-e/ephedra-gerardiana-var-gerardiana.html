                    <h1>Ephedra gerardiana var. gerardiana</h1>
<p>Ephedra gerardiana var. gerardiana, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is known for containing the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for misuse, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
