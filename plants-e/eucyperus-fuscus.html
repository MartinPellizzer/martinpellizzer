                    <h1>Eucyperus fuscus</h1>
<p>Eucyperus fuscus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that form a complex network to stabilize sediments and trap sediments in tidal zones. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, dark purple flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and its fruits are woody capsules that release buoyant seeds.</p>
<p>Eucyperus fuscus plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
