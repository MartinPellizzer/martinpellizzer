<p>Epipactis × schulzei var. wolfii, commonly known as the Schultze's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip, characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is known for its genetic diversity and is of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origins.</p>
