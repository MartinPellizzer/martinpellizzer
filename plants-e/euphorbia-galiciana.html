                    <h1>Euphorbia galiciana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia galiciana, commonly known as the Galician spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
