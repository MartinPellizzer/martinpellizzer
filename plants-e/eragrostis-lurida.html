<p>Eragrostis lurida, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Eragrostis lurida is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
