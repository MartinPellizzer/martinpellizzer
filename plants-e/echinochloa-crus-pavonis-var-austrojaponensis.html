                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. austrojaponensis</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-pavonis var. austrojaponensis, commonly known as the Japanese barnyard grass, is a grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed E. crus-pavonis.</p>
