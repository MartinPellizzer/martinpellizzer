                    <h1>Espeletia cachaluensis</h1>
<p>Espeletia cachaluensis, commonly known as the Cachalú or Cachalú flower, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rosette-forming leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia cachaluensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
