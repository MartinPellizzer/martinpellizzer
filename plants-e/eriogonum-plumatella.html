                    <h1>Eriogonum plumatella</h1>
<p>Eriogonum plumatella, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Eriogonum plumatella plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
