                            <h1>Euphorbia Lamarckii Var. Broussonetii</h1>
<p>Lamarck's spurge, scientifically known as Euphorbia lamarckii var. broussonetii, is a striking and resilient plant native to arid regions of Africa. With its unique, spiky appearance and vibrant green color, it has become a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. This succulent is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal water and nutrients. Its ornamental value is matched by its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its toxic sap and sharp leaves.</p>
