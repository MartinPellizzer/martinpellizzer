<p>Equisetum sylvaticum var. squarrosum, commonly known as the rough horse-tail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing branches called strobila, which are typically found at the apex of the plant. The plant has a distinctive, segmented stem that is often covered with small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
