<p>Elaphoglossum gardnerianum, commonly known as Gardner's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
