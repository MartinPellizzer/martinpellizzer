<p>Eragrostis jacquinii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health and restoration efforts.</p>
