<p>Elynanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for seed dispersal through mammalian digestion.</p>
<p>Elynanthus grandiflorus plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae.</p>
