<p>Ephemerantha annamensis, commonly known as the Annam ephemeral, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in shaded, moist habitats. Its short lifespan and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
