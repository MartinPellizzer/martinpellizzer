                    <h1>Excentradenia</h1>
<p>Excentradenia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. Their flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
