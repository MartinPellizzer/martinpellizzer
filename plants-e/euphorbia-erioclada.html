                    <h1>Euphorbia erioclada</h1>
<p>Euphorbia erioclada, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellowish-green stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Euphorbia erioclada contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
