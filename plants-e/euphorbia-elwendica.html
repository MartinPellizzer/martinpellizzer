                    <h1>Euphorbia elwendica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia elwendica, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia elwendica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
