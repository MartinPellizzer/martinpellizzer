<p>Elatostema halophyllum, commonly known as the saltbush or saltplant, is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is native to coastal and arid regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Elatostema halophyllum is adapted to tolerate high salinity and drought, making it an important species in saline ecosystems.</p>
