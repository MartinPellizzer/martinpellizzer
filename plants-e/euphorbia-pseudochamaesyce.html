                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudochamaesyce</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudochamaesyce, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pseudochamaesyce is also noted for its ability to propagate easily from cuttings.</p>
