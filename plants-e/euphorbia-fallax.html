                    <h1>Euphorbia fallax</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fallax, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fallax is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
