<p>Erophila stelligera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, salty conditions.</p>
<p>Erophila stelligera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
