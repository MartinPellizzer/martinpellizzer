                    <h1>Espeletia aristeguietana</h1>
<p>Espeletia aristeguietana, commonly known as the "Páramo Lily," is a flowering plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pink flowers. The plant is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments of the Andes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Espeletia aristeguietana is considered vulnerable.</p>
