                    <h1>Echinopsis baumannii</h1>
<p>Echinopsis baumannii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a striking blue or purple coloration due to the presence of a cyanobacterial endophyte. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, the Moon Cactus is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
