                    <h1>Eriosorus × lasseri</h1>
<p>Eriosorus × lasseri, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eriosorus lepidophyllus and Eriosorus lasseri.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
