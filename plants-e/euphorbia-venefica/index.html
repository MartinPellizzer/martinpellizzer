                            <h1>Euphorbia Venefica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia venefica is a striking and often dangerous plant known for its toxic sap and spiky foliage. Native to arid regions, it thrives in harsh environments where few other plants can survive. Despite its appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing shelter for small animals and insects. Its name, meaning "poisonous" in Latin, reflects the potent irritants it contains. This plant serves as both a warning and a reminder of nature's dual capacity to be beautiful and perilous.</p>
