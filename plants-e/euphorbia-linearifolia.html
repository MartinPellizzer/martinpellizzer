                    <h1>Euphorbia linearifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
