                    <h1>Euploca rariflora</h1>
<p>Euploca rariflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered euploca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Euploca rariflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
