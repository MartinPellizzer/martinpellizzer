                    <h1>Euphorbia schiedeana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cluster called a cyathium. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
