                    <h1>Euphorbia paucipila</h1>
<p>Euphorbia paucipila, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia paucipila is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
