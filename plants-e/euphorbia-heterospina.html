                    <h1>Euphorbia heterospina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heterospina, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, with some species displaying leaf-like structures called phyllodes.</p>
<p>Euphorbia heterospina is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
