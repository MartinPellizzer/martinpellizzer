                <h1>Echinocodon primulifolius</h1>
<p>Echinocodon primulifolius, commonly known as the primroseleaf echinocactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange, during the warm season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinocodon primulifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
