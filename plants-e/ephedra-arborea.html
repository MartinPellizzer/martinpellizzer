<p>Ephedra arborea, commonly known as the tree ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its branching, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ephedra arborea is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its alkaloids, such as ephedrine, are now regulated due to their potential for misuse.</p>
