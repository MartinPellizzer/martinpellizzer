<p>Elaphoglossum conforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Elaphoglossum conforme is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic contexts.</p>
