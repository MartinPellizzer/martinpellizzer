<p>Echinodiscus erinaceus, commonly known as the horned disk, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, disk-like structure that resembles a sea urchin, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually thin and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinodiscus erinaceus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
