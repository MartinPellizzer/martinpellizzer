<p>Euphorbia colligata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common trait among many euphorbias. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
