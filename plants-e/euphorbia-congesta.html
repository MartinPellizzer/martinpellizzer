<p>Euphorbia congesta, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a dense cluster. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often mistaken for flowers. Euphorbia congesta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its spiny stems and toxic sap make it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>
