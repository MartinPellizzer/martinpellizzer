                    <h1>Euphorbia saxicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia saxicola is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
