<p>Eriophorum vaginatum subsp.</p>
<p>fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the tips of its slender stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinctive sheath that wraps around the stem, and it is often found in association with other arctic flora.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
