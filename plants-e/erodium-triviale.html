                    <h1>Erodium triviale</h1>
<p>Erodium triviale, commonly known as common stork's bill, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 cm and has small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright pink or red flowers with a distinctive beak-like spur, which gives it its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium triviale is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
