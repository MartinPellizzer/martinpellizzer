<p>Echinocereus conoideus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in bright, radial spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its adaptations to arid environments include a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Echinocereus conoideus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience in dry climates.</p>
