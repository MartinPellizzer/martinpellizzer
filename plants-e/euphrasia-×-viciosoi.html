                    <h1>Euphrasia × viciosoi</h1>
<p>Euphrasia × viciosoi, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a hybrid species within the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect populations.</p>
