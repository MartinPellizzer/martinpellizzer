                    <h1>Eucalyptus griffithsii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus griffithsii, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dull green and aromatic. The tree produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its timber is valued for its strength and workability, though it is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus griffithsii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
