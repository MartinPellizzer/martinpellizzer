                    <h1>Elaeagnus triflora var. brevilimbatus</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus triflora var. brevilimbatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, trifoliate leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Elaeagnus triflora, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
