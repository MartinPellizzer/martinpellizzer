<p>Evolvulus saxifragus var. paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a valuable ornamental and a challenging invasive species in some regions.</p>
