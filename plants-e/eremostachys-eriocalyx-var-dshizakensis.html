                    <h1>Eremostachys eriocalyx var. dshizakensis</h1>
<p>Eremostachys eriocalyx var. dshizakensis, commonly known as the Mongolian fireweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
