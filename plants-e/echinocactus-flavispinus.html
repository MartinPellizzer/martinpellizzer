<p>Echinocactus flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. Its spines are yellow to orange in color, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Echinocactus flavispinus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
