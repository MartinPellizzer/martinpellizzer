<p>Eleocharis pauciflora var. suksdorfiana, commonly known as the Saksdorf's spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its rhizomatous growth and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, and its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing microhabitats for aquatic organisms.</p>
