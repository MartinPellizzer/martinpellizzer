                            <h1>Elytropappus Hispidus</h1>
<p>Elytropappus hispidus is a small, annual flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is commonly known as the hairy goldenweed due to its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy foliage. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its compact size and resilience make it an important part of local ecosystems. Despite its modest appearance, Elytropappus hispidus plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity.</p>
