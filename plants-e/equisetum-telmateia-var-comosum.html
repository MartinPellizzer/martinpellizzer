                    <h1>Equisetum telmateia var. comosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum telmateia var. comosum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stems. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
