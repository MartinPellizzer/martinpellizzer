<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
