<p>Ebenus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with numerous upright, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ebenus longipes is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
