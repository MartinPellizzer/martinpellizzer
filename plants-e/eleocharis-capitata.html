                    <h1>Eleocharis capitata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis capitata, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and contribute to soil retention.</p>
<p>Eleocharis capitata plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
