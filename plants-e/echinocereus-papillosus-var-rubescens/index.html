<p>Red hedgehog cactus, scientifically known as Echinocereus papillosus var. rubescens, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its dense clusters of short, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The vivid red coloration of its stems makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to flourish. With its unique appearance and low maintenance needs, it is a favorite among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
