They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Eurystyles species have small, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The flowers usually have three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into a specialized lip.</p>
