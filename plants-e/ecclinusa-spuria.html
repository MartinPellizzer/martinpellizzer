<p>Ecclinusa spuria, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are small and often reduced, with the main photosynthetic function carried out by the stems.</p>
<p>Ecclinusa spuria is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrient uptake.</p>
