<p>Encephalartos vroomii, commonly known as the Vroomâ€™s cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Encephalartos vroomii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
