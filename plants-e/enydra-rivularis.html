                    <h1>Enydra rivularis</h1>
<p>Enydra rivularis, commonly known as water pepper, is a low-growing annual herb native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread along riverbanks and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Enydra rivularis is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic.</p>
