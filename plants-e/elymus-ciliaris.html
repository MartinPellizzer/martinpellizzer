<p>Elymus ciliaris, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fine, silky hairs along the leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Elymus ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
