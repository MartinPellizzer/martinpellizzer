<p>Eremophila scoparia, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Emu Bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
