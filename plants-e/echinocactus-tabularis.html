<p>Echinocactus tabularis, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, apple-like fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus tabularis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
