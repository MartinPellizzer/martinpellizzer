                    <h1>Euphorbia francoisii var. crassicaulis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia francoisii var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
