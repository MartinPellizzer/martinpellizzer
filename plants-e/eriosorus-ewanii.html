<p>Eriosorus ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Eriosorus ewanii is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
