                    <h1>Elephantopus arenosus</h1>
<p>Elephantopus arenosus, commonly known as sand elephantopus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
