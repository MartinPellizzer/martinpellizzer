<p>Elymus elongatus subsp.</p>
<p>haifensis, commonly known as the Haifa wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
