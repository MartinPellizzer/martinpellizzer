                    <h1>Erica carnea</h1>
<p>Erica carnea, commonly known as the evergreen heath, is a flowering plant native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30â€“60 cm, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pink, white, or red blooms from late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Erica carnea thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it an effective ground cover in difficult gardening conditions.</p>
