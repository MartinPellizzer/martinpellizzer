<p>Echinochloa colonum var. repens, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often arranged in a loose panicle. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers, and its rhizomes allow it to spread aggressively. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, agricultural fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a significant weed in many crops.</p>
