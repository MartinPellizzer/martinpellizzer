                    <h1>Erucastrum leucanthum f. brachycarpum</h1>
<p>Erucastrum leucanthum f. brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-carpelled bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its nutrition through captured prey.</p>
