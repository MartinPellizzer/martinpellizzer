<p>Epipactis latifolia var. bracteis-longioribus, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy greenish-yellow flowers with a prominent lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer bracts compared to the typical form of Epipactis latifolia.</p>
