<p>Epipactis helleborine subsp.</p>
<p>pontica, commonly known as the Pontic helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other members of the *Epipactis* genus.</p>
