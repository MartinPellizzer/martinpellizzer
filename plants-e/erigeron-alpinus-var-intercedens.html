                    <h1>Erigeron alpinus var. intercedens</h1>
<p>Erigeron alpinus var. intercedens, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
