<p>Euphorbia ocellata var. typica is a striking succulent known for its unique, spiky appearance and vibrant coloration. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where it adapts well to harsh conditions. Its most notable feature is the presence of bright yellow to orange sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant's name refers to the eye-like patterns on its stems, which give it a distinctive and ornamental look. It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
