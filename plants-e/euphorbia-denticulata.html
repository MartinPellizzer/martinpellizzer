<p>Euphorbia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and opposite, narrow, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to arid gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
