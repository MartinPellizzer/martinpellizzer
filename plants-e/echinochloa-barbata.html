                    <h1>Echinochloa barbata</h1>
<p>Echinochloa barbata, commonly known as hairy barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the nodes, with awns (bristle-like structures) present on the lemma. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, making it a common weed.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its invasive potential in various ecosystems.</p>
