                    <h1>Epidendrum atropurpureum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flower spikes that bloom during the warmer months. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum atropurpureum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
