                    <h1>Espeletia rigida</h1>
<p>Espeletia rigida, commonly known as the rigid heath, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in the dry, cold conditions of p√°ramo ecosystems. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia rigida plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine regions.</p>
