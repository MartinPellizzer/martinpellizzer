                    <h1>Euphorbia polygonisperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polygonisperma, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
