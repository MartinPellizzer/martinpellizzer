                    <h1>Epidendrum aporoides</h1>
<p>Epidendrum aporoides, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale green stems and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy, white coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
