<p>Elatostema scapigerum, commonly known as the small-stemmed elatostema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Elatostema scapigerum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
