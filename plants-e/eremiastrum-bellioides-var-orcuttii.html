                    <h1>Eremiastrum bellioides var. orcuttii</h1>
<p>Eremiastrum bellioides var. orcuttii, commonly known as Orcutt's needlegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Eremiastrum bellioides.</p>
