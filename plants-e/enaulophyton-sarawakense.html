<p>Enaulophyton sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak star moss, is a unique liverwort found in the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure. The plant exhibits a flattened, ribbon-like morphology with a dense network of rhizoids that anchor it to moist, shaded substrates. It thrives in humid environments, typically growing on rocks or decaying wood in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
