<p>Elegia paniculata, commonly known as the sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems topped with dense, spike-like clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Elegia paniculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
