                    <h1>Ericoila alpina</h1>
<p>Ericoila alpina, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Ericoila alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
