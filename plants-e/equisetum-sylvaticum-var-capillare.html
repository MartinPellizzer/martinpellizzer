                    <h1>Equisetum sylvaticum var. capillare</h1>
<p>Equisetum sylvaticum var. capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures, which are typical of horsetails. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature that distinguishes it from flowering plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants.</p>
