                    <h1>Eurotia lanata</h1>
<p>Eurotia lanata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and branches. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of host plants such as grasses and shrubs. It produces small, yellowish flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
