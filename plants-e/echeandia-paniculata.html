                    <h1>Echeandia paniculata</h1>
<p>Echeandia paniculata, commonly known as the panicle cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicle-like clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echeandia paniculata is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes.</p>
