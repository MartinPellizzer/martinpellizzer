<p>Echinocereus stramineus subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Prickly Pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny, greenish-yellow to reddish-brown areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
