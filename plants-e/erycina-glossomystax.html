                    <h1>Erycina glossomystax</h1>
<p>Erycina glossomystax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
