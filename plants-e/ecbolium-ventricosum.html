                    <h1>Ecbolium ventricosum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium ventricosum, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its inflated, pod-like fruits that resemble bladders, hence its common name. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Ecbolium ventricosum is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small insects.</p>
