<p>Euphorbia villosa subsp.</p>
<p>semivillosa, commonly known as the soft-spined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
