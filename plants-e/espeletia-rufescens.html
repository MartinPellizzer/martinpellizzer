                    <h1>Espeletia rufescens</h1>
<p>Espeletia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in p√°ramo ecosystems, where it adapts to cold and moist conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Espeletia rufescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
