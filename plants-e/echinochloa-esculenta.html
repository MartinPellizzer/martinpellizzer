                    <h1>Echinochloa esculenta</h1>
<p>Echinochloa esculenta, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbed leaves and spike-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats, including rice paddies and pastures.</p>
<p>While it has some historical use as a food source, it is primarily known for its invasive potential in cultivated areas.</p>
