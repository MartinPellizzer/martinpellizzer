                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli f. breviseta</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli f. breviseta, commonly known as the short-haired barnyard grass, is a variant of the common barnyard grass.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions, often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its short, stiff hairs on the leaves and stem, which distinguish it from the typical form. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets.</p>
<p>This form is often considered a weed in cereal crops due to its competitive growth habit.</p>
