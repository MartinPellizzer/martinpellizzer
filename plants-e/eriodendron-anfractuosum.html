                    <h1>Eriodendron anfractuosum</h1>
<p>Eriodendron anfractuosum, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered endangered in some regions.</p>
