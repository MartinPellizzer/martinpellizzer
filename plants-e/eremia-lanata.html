<p>Eremia lanata, commonly known as the hairy eremis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Eremia lanata is often found growing in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
