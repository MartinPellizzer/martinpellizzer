                    <h1>Euphorbia macvaughii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
