                    <h1>Ephemerantha bifida</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha bifida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom briefly during the summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are critical due to habitat loss and environmental changes threatening its survival.</p>
