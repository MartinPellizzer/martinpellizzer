                    <h1>Echinops rechingeri var. cryptadenus</h1>
<p>Echinops rechingeri var. cryptadenus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble those of the echinops genus, though it belongs to the Malvaceae family. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
