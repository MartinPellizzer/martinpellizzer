                    <h1>Euphorbia prieuriana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia prieuriana, commonly known as the Prieur's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by vibrant green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia prieuriana is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
