                    <h1>Eriospermum viscosum</h1>
<p>Eriospermum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant defense mechanisms and ecological interactions.</p>
