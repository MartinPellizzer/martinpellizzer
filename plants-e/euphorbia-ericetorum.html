                    <h1>Euphorbia ericetorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ericetorum, commonly known as the heath spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland edges. The plant features woody stems covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered in structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ericetorum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>
