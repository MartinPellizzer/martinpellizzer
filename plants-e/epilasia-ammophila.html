                    <h1>Epilasia ammophila</h1>
<p>Epilasia ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize sand dunes. Its narrow leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Epilasia ammophila plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
