                    <h1>Echinocactus ingens f. helophorus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ingens f. helophorus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring and adding a dramatic visual contrast to the plant's rugged structure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
