<p>Erigeron glabratus subsp.</p>
<p>candidus, commonly known as the white fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white ray florets and dark brown disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance to pollinators.</p>
