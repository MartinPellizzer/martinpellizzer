<p>Euphorbia denisiana var. denisiana, commonly known as the Denisian spurge, is a succulent plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
