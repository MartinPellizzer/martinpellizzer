                    <h1>Elaphoglossum neocaledonicum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian holly fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or clay soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
