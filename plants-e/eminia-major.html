                    <h1>Eminia major</h1>
<p>Eminia major, commonly known as the giant eminia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
