                    <h1>Eriocaulon pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soft substrates, while its compact size allows it to thrive in limited spaces.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon pygmaeum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
