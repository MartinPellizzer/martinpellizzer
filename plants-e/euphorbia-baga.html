                    <h1>Euphorbia baga</h1>
<p>Euphorbia baga, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia baga is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
