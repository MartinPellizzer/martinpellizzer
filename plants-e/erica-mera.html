                    <h1>Erica mera</h1>
<p>Erica mera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica mera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife.</p>
