<p>Euphorbia dulcis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its fuzzy, woolly texture on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
