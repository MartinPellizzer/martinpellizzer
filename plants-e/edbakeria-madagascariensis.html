                    <h1>Edbakeria madagascariensis</h1>
<p>Edbakeria madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with a spiny, star-like appearance, which helps it retain water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is often cultivated in specialized environments.</p>
