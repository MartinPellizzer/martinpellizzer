                    <h1>Eriocaulon heleocharioides</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon heleocharioides, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread through underground stems. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon heleocharioides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
