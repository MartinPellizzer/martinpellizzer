<p>Euphorbia robusta var. interioris, commonly known as the indoor euphorbia or African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation.</p>
