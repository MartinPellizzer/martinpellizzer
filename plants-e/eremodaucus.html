                    <h1>Eremodaucus</h1>
<p>Eremodaucus, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Eremodaucus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, dry environments.</p>
