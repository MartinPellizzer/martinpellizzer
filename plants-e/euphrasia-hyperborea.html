<p>Euphrasia hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
