                    <h1>Euphorbia exigua f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exigua f. caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its succulent nature, it is drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
