<p>Ennealophus foliosus subsp.</p>
<p>spruceanus, commonly known as the Spruceleaf Ennealophus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by wind or specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows or on steep slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
