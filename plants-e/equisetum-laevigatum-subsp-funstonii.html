<p>Equisetum laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>funstonii, commonly known as the Funston's horse tail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are arranged in whorls. Its morphology resembles that of other horsetails, with a distinct lack of true leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological succession in wetland environments.</p>
