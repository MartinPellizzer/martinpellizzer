                    <h1>Euphorbia spinulosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
