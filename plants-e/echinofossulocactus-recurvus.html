                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus recurvus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus recurvus, commonly known as the recurved echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with ribbed structure and spiny, recurved spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its rugged form. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and botanical gardens.</p>
