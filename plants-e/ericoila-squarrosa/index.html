                            <h1>Ericoila Squarrosa</h1>
<p>Square-leaved heather, scientifically known as Ericoila squarrosa, is a rare and delicate evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive square-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
