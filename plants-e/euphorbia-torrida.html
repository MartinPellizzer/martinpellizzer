                    <h1>Euphorbia torrida</h1>
<p>Euphorbia torrida, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, cylindrical spikes of bright red bracts that resemble poker chips, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of wax that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, followed by unique, gelatinous seed pods.</p>
<p>Euphorbia torrida is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
