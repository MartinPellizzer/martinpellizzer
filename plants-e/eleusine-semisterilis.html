                    <h1>Eleusine semisterilis</h1>
<p>Eleusine semisterilis, commonly known as the semi-sterile lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. While it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its semi-sterile nature suggests reduced seed production, which may influence its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
