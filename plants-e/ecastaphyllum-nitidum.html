<p>Ecastaphyllum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Ecastaphyllum nitidum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both its prey capture and its role as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
