                    <h1>Euporteria nidus</h1>
<p>Euporteria nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that form a dense, nest-like structure, providing a habitat for small organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its broad, fibrous rhizomes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
