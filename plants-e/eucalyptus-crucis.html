                    <h1>Eucalyptus crucis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus crucis, commonly known as the cross-shaped eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-green underlayer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus crucis is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species within the eucalyptus genus.</p>
