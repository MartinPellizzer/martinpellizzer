<p>Eriogonum wrightii var. floccosum, commonly known as the white-tasseled buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, cottony layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is part of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
