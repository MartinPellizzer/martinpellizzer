                    <h1>Elymus dasystachys f. nudus</h1>
<p>Elymus dasystachys f. nudus, commonly known as the naked false wheatgrass, is a variant of the species Elymus dasystachys, characterized by its reduced or absent glumes on the spikelets.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to the western United States, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in the reduction of floral structures, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species.</p>
<p>This feature makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
