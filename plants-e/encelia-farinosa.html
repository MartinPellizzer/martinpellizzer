<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Encelia farinosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
