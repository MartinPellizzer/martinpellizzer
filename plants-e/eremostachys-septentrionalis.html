<p>Eremostachys septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern eremostachys, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and grey-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Eremostachys septentrionalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
