                    <h1>Eriopsis</h1>
<p>Eriopsis, commonly known as the "devil's toenail," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Eriopsis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>They are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural areas due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
