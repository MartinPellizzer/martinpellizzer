                    <h1>Elymus condensatus f. pubens</h1>
<p>Elymus condensatus f. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent needlegrass, is a variant of the needlegrass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in ecological restoration projects.</p>
