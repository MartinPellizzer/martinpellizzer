<p>Erianthus capensis, commonly known as the Cape reed, is a perennial grass native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>Erianthus capensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
