                    <h1>Eutrema wasabi var. sachalinense</h1>
<p>Eutrema wasabi var. sachalinense, commonly known as Japanese wasabi, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, streamside habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a distinctive, pungent aroma due to the presence of isothiocyanates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant is cultivated for its edible root, which is used in Japanese cuisine.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common wasabi (Eutrema wasabi) but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different chemical composition.</p>
