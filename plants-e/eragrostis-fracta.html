<p>Eragrostis fracta, commonly known as the slender weeping grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its delicate, drooping inflorescences that give it a weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Eragrostis fracta is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique visual appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
