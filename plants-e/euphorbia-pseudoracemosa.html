                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudoracemosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudoracemosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features stout, cylindrical stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water evaporation.</p>
<p>The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
