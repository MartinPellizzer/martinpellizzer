                    <h1>Euphorbia insulana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia insulana, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, tree-like structure with a thick, branching stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia insulana is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation in isolated ecosystems.</p>
