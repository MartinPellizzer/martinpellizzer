                    <h1>Epithelantha</h1>
<p>Epithelantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Epithelantha species are typically perennial, with some varieties capable of surviving extreme drought conditions due to their deep root systems. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a vital role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The genus is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, which is an adaptation to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
