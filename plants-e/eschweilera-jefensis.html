<p>Eschweilera jefensis, commonly known as the Jef√©n's sycoglossum, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eschweilera jefensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
