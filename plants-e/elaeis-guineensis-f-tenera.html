                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis f. tenera</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis f. tenera, commonly known as the dwarf oil palm, is a cultivar of the oil palm plant native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical oil palm, making it suitable for smaller farms and urban environments. The plant produces fruit-bearing clusters that yield oil-rich nuts, which are used for food and industrial purposes. Its compact size and high oil content make it a valuable alternative in sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>This variety is also favored for its resilience to certain environmental conditions and pests.</p>
