                    <h1>Echinocactus theiacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus theiacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny exterior and a globular shape that becomes more rounded with age. The plant features a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
