                    <h1>Ericoila imbricata</h1>
<p>Ericoila imbricata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment.</p>
<p>Ericoila imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
