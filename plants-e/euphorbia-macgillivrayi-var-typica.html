<p>Euphorbia macgillivrayi var. typica, commonly known as the Macgillivray's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small and sometimes reduced, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
