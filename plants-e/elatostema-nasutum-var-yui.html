                    <h1>Elatostema nasutum var. yui</h1>
<p>Elatostema nasutum var. yui, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elatostema, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphological features and ecological niche.</p>
