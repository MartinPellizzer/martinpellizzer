<p>Eragrostis polymorpha, commonly known as variable lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis polymorpha is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
