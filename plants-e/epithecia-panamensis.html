<p>Epithecia panamensis, commonly known as the Panama cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Trapellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically bright green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. It reproduces through the release of spores from its apothecia, which are small, disc-shaped structures.</p>
<p>Epithecia panamensis plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its natural habitats.</p>
