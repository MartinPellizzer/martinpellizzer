<p>Eriospermum peteri, commonly known as the coastal eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is robust, enabling it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Eriospermum peteri is often found in dune habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion.</p>
