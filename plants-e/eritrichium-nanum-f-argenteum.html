<p>Eritrichium nanum f. argenteum, commonly known as silver dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a short stem with few branches.</p>
