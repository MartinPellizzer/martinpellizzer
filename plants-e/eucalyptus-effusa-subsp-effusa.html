<p>Eucalyptus effusa subsp.</p>
<p>effusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing small, brown seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its hardy nature and is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
