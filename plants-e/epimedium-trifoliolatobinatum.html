<p>Epimedium trifoliolatobinatum, commonly known as the three-leafed barrenwort, is a species of flowering plant in the Berberidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its evergreen, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in shady gardens.</p>
