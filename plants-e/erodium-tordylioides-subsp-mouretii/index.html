                            <h1>Erodium Tordylioides Subsp. Mouretii</h1>
<p>Redstem filaree, scientifically known as Erodium tordylioides subsp. mouretii, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. The plant is characterized by its reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a common weed in many areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
