                    <h1>Eucalyptus quadrans</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus quadrans, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Eucalyptus quadrans is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly cineole, have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy.</p>
