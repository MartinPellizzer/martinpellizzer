<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
