                    <h1>Echinopogon intermedius</h1>
<p>Echinopogon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to wet environments, with a robust root system and a compact growth form.</p>
