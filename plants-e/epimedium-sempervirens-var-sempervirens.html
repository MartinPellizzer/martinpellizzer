<p>Epimedium sempervirens var. sempervirens, commonly known as barrenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense ground cover over time.</p>
