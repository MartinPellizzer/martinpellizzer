                    <h1>Elaphoglossum piloselloides</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy scales, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are usually covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum piloselloides is a relatively rare species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular microclimatic conditions.</p>
