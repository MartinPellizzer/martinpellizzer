<p>Eucalyptus pachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-barked gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus pachycarpa is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in open forests and woodlands.</p>
