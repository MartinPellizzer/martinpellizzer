                    <h1>Everion</h1>
<p>Everion, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom only during the brief summer months. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in extreme conditions with minimal water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Everion is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest.</p>
