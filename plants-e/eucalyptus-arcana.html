                    <h1>Eucalyptus arcana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus arcana, commonly known as the slender ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the northwestern region of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing viable seeds. Eucalyptus arcana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is a valuable species for ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
