<p>Eremoluma sagotiana, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Eremoluma sagotiana is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
