                    <h1>Erythroxylum squamatum var. orinocense</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum squamatum var. orinocense, commonly known as the Orinoco coca, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the alkaloid cocaine, making it a subject of both botanical and pharmacological interest. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of concern in discussions related to drug policy and conservation.</p>
