<p>Elytrigia alaica subsp.</p>
<p>pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Pamir Mountains, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and steppes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
