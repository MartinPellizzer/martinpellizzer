                    <h1>Euphorbia taifensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia taifensis, commonly known as the Taif spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia taifensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
