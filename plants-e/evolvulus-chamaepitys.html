                    <h1>Evolvulus chamaepitys</h1>
<p>Evolvulus chamaepitys, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Evolvulus chamaepitys is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, open areas.</p>
