<p>Eritrichium walpersii, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its small, five-petaled flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Eritrichium walpersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
