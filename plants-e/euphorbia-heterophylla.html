                <h1>Euphorbia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heterophylla, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
