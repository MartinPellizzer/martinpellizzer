                    <h1>Eriocaulon panagudianum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon panagudianum, commonly known as the Panagudian flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon panagudianum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms.</p>
