                    <h1>Euphorbia serrata f. truncata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serrata f. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are sharply serrated along the edges. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
