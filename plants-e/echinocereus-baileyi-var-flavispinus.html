<p>Echinocereus baileyi var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular and arranged at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its bright yellow spines, which contrast with its pale green to blue-gray stems.</p>
