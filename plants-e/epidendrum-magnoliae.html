                    <h1>Epidendrum magnoliae</h1>
<p>Epidendrum magnoliae, commonly known as the Magnolia orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble those of the magnolia tree, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Epidendrum magnoliae thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
