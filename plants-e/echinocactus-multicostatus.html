<p>Echinocactus multicostatus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure. The plant features a dense covering of golden-yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its areoles, which are specialized structures, bear the spines and are where flowers and new growth emerge.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
