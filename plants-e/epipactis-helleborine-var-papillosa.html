                    <h1>Epipactis helleborine var. papillosa</h1>
<p>Epipactis helleborine var. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single, showy greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The hairy helleborine is notable for its ability to mimic the appearance of other plants, a trait that may aid in its survival and reproduction.</p>
