                    <h1>Elasmatium repens</h1>
<p>Elasmatium repens, commonly known as the creeping elasmatium, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Elatostomataceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and delicate, overlapping leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Elasmatium repens plays a minor role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
