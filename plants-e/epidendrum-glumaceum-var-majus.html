                    <h1>Epidendrum glumaceum var. majus</h1>
<p>Epidendrum glumaceum var. majus, commonly known as the showy epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
