<p>Euphorbia micracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often mistaken for true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia micracantha is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems and leaves, a characteristic common among many succulent species.</p>
