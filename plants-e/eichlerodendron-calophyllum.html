                    <h1>Eichlerodendron calophyllum</h1>
<p>Eichlerodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It has adapted to saline environments through specialized root systems that filter out salt, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing coastal soils and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life.</p>
