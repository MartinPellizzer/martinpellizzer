<p>Elaeagnus dendroidea, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white bark, which becomes flaky and fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus dendroidea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment.</p>
