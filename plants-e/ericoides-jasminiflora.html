                <h1>Ericoides jasminiflora</h1>
<p>Ericoides jasminiflora, commonly known as the jasmine-flowered ericoid, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring, resembling those of jasmine, hence its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky terrains.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings.</p>
