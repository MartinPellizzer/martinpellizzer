<p>Eremophila coacta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Eremophila coacta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
