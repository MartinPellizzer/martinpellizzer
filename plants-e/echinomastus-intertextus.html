                    <h1>Echinomastus intertextus</h1>
<p>Echinomastus intertextus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Echinomastus intertextus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture.</p>
