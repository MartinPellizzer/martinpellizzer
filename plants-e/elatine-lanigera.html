                    <h1>Elatine lanigera</h1>
<p>Elatine lanigera, commonly known as the velvet pondweed, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. Elatine lanigera is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
