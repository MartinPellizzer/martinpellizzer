                    <h1>Epiphorella dalzielii</h1>
<p>Epiphorella dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's epiphytic orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which helps it blend with its environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
