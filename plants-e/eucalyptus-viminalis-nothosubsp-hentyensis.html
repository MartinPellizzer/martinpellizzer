<p>Eucalyptus viminalis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>hentyensis, commonly known as the Henty's malleable gum, is a hybrid eucalyptus species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and grey.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically cream to pale yellow in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
