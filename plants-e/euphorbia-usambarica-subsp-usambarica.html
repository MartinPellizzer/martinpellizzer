<p>Euphorbia usambarica subsp.</p>
<p>usambarica, commonly known as the Usambara euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces unique cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
