<p>Eleocharis fennica var. fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the vegetation in its native wetland ecosystems.</p>
