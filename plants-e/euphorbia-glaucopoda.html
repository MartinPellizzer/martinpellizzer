<p>Euphorbia glaucopoda, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia glaucopoda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
