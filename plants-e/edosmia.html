                    <h1>Edosmia</h1>
<p>Edosmia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Edosmia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
