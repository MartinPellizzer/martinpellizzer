The flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and they are borne in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree produces small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
