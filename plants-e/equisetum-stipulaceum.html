                    <h1>Equisetum stipulaceum</h1>
<p>Equisetum stipulaceum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the genus Equisetum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures called annular rings. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. Equisetum stipulaceum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
