<p>Epidendrum asperirachis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum asperirachis is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
