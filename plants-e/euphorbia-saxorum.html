                    <h1>Euphorbia saxorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia saxorum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, green stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cyathium, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and sometimes spiny, providing additional protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia saxorum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
