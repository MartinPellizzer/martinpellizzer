<p>Echium arenarium var. debile, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing, annual plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its structure is compact, with a prostrate or ascending growth habit, and it often forms dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It is a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
