<p>Epipactis palustris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flower per stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The marsh helleborine is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
