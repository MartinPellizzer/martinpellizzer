                    <h1>Eria dalzellii var. fimbriata</h1>
<p>Eria dalzellii var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers with distinctive fringed petals and sepals, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
