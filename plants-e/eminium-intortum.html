                    <h1>Eminium intortum</h1>
<p>Eminium intortum, commonly known as the twisted eminium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral-arranged leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from thin, rocky soil. Eminium intortum is known for its slow growth and resilience to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
