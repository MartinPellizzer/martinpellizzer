                    <h1>Ephedra antisyphilitica var. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Ephedra antisyphilitica var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical capsules containing minute seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has historically been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity.</p>
