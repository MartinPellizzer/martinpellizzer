<p>Eustrephus amplexifolius, commonly known as the clasping-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy, and often reddish leaves that tightly clasp the stem. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its flowers are tubular at the base and gradually widen into a bell shape, with five lobes at the mouth.</p>
<p>Eustrephus amplexifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens.</p>
