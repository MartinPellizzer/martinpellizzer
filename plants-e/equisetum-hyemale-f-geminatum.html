                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale f. geminatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale f. geminatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that becomes hollow as it matures. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often near streams or in shaded, damp environments. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its fossil record extends back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>The f. geminatum form is distinguished by its tendency to produce twin stems, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Equisetum.</p>
