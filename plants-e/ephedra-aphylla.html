                    <h1>Ephedra aphylla</h1>
<p>Ephedra aphylla, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced or absent. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain alkaloids, such as ephedrine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Ephedra aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick cuticle and ability to store water in its stems.</p>
