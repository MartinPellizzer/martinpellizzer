<p>Erigeron acutatus, commonly known as the sharpleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the central and western regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and sharply pointed, giving it its common name, while its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>Erigeron acutatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators.</p>
