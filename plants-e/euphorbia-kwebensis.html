<p>Euphorbia kwebensis, commonly known as the Kwebeni spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia kwebensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
