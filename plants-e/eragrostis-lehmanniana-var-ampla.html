                    <h1>Eragrostis lehmanniana var. ampla</h1>
<p>Eragrostis lehmanniana var. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf-like growth.</p>
