<p>Eucalyptus oleosa subsp.</p>
<p>cylindroidea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a subshrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical leaves that are often tinged with blue or grey, and its smooth, pale grey bark.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that are typically white or pale blue, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
