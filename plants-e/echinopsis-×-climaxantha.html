                    <h1>Echinopsis × climaxantha</h1>
<p>Echinopsis × climaxantha, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Echinopsis chamaecaulis and Echinopsis subdenudata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a distinctive, often brightly colored crown. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens.</p>
