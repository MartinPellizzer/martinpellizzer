                    <h1>Euphorbia pinea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pinea, commonly known as the pine tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in a layer of white, waxy sap that protects it from drought and herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by unique, cup-shaped seed capsules. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pinea is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments.</p>
