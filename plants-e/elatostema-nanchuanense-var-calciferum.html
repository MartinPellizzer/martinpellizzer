<p>Elatostema nanchuanense var. calciferum, commonly known as the limestone Elatostema, is a rare plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils, preferring shaded and moist environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
