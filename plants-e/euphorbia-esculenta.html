                    <h1>Euphorbia esculenta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia esculenta, commonly known as the African butterplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces unique cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing small yellow flowers. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Despite its potential hazards, it is cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
