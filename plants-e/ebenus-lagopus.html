<p>Ebenus lagopus, commonly known as the snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
