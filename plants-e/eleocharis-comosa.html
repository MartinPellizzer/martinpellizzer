                    <h1>Eleocharis comosa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis comosa, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a species of grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of small, white to pale brown flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis comosa is also an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
