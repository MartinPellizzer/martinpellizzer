<p>Encephalartos msinganus, commonly known as the Msingane cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, orange-brown cones. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
