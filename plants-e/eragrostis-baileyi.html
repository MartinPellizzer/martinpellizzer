                <h1>Eragrostis baileyi</h1>
<p>Eragrostis baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, grass-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects in dry regions.</p>
