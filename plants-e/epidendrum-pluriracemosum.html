<p>Epidendrum pluriracemosum, commonly known as the many-branched epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is usually dark green and waxy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pluriracemosum is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and garden displays due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
