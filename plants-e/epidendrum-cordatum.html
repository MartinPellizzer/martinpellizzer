<p>Epidendrum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum cordatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
