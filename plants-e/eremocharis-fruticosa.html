<p>Eremocharis fruticosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
