<p>Elaphoglossum amparoanum, commonly known as the Amparo holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum amparoanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
