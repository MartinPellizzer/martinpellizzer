                    <h1>Eucalyptus umbrawarrensis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus umbrawarrensis, commonly known as the Blackwood gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are released in spring and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus umbrawarrensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands.</p>
