                    <h1>Encephalartos altensteinii var. parvifolius</h1>
<p>Encephalartos altensteinii var. parvifolius, commonly known as the dwarf knobbed cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its unique, knob-like structures on the trunk. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette pattern. Its inflorescences are typically concealed within the foliage, and it produces both male and female cones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
