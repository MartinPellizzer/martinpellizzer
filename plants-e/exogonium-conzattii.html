                    <h1>Exogonium conzattii</h1>
<p>Exogonium conzattii, commonly known as the Zantia orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Exogonium conzattii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
