<p>Elaphoglossum trivittatum, commonly known as the three-veined holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it often grows in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's intricate venation and compact growth habit make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
