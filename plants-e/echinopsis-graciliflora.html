<p>Echinopsis graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a smooth, pale green stem that often develops a reddish tint when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
<p>Echinopsis graciliflora is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its compact size and ornamental flowers.</p>
