<p>monostachya, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stems that often branch at the base, and its small, scale-like leaves are typically reduced to tubercles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules containing minute seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine, though its use is regulated due to potential toxicity.</p>
