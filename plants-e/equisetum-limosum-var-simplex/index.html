                            <h1>Equisetum Limosum Var. Simplex</h1>
<p>Common horsetail, scientifically known as Equisetum limosum var. simplex, is a primitive plant that has thrived for millions of years. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. This plant is notable for its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to reproduce through spores rather than seeds. Its hollow, jointed stems and ancient appearance give it a unique place in both ecological and historical contexts. Despite its simple structure, it plays an important role in supporting biodiversity and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
