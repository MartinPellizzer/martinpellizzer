                    <h1>Euphorbia neorubella</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neorubella, commonly known as the red-veined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
