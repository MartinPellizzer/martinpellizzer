                    <h1>Eucalyptus andreana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus andreana, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in groups of three, typically appearing in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in sandy soils along coastal regions.</p>
