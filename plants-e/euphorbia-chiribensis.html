<p>Euphorbia chiribensis, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chiribensis is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
