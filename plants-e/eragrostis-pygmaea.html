                    <h1>Eragrostis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf lovegrass, is a small annual grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature and ability to colonize open spaces, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
