                    <h1>Echinocactus leptanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus leptanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus leptanthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
