                    <h1>Equisetum eburneum</h1>
<p>Equisetum eburneum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Equisetum eburneum thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
