<p>Elaphoglossum gertii, commonly known as the Gert's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically exhibit a dark green color with a glossy sheen. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum gertii is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
