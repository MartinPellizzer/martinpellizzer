                    <h1>Euphorbia fluminis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fluminis, commonly known as the river euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist, sandy soils. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid habitat.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fluminis is also notable for its milky sap, which can be irritant and is a characteristic feature of many species in the genus.</p>
