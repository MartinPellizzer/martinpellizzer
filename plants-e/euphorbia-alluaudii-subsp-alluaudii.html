<p>Euphorbia alluaudii subsp.</p>
<p>alluaudii, commonly known as the "Karoo euphorbia," is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
