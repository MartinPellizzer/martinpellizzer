                    <h1>Elymus arenicola</h1>
<p>Elymus arenicola, commonly known as sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in sandy and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of wheat-like seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Elymus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
