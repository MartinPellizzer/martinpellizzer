                    <h1>Evax prolifera</h1>
<p>Evax prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a smooth, dark green appearance, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
