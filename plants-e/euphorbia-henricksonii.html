                    <h1>Euphorbia henricksonii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia henricksonii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a unique, spiky center, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia henricksonii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
