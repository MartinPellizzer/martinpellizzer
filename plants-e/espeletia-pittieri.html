<p>Espeletia pittieri, commonly known as the Páramo espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to cold, humid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Espeletia pittieri plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local species.</p>
