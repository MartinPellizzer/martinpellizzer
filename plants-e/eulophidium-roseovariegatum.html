<p>Eulophidium roseovariegatum, commonly known as the variegated rose moss, is a member of the family Dendroceratidae and is characterized by its unique, branching structure.</p>
<p>It is a type of liverwort, specifically a thallose liverwort, which means it has a flat, leaf-like structure rather than true leaves. The plant exhibits a striking coloration with pink and green variegation, which is particularly noticeable in its reproductive structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
