                    <h1>Erodium tenuisectum</h1>
<p>Erodium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and divided into several lobes. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and rapid life cycle, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
