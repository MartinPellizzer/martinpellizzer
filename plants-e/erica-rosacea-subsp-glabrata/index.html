                            <h1>Erica Rosacea Subsp. Glabrata</h1>
<p>Erica rosacea subsp. glabrata is a unique evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and small, leathery leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils and withstand salt spray from the sea. Its flowers, which appear in late winter, are pinkish-white and add a subtle elegance to the landscape. Despite its resilience, it remains a rare and often overlooked member of the heath family.</p>
