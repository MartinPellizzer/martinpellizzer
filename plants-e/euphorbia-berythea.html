<p>Euphorbia berythea, commonly known as the Berythea spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a characteristic structure of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and may bear small spines, contributing to its defensive adaptations.</p>
<p>Euphorbia berythea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
