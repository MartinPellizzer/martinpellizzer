<p>Encholirium ctenophyllum, commonly known as the Mexican sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Encholirium ctenophyllum is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
