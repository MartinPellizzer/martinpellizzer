                    <h1>Euphorbia gorgonis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gorgonis, commonly known as the Gorgon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often the only visible part of the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution.</p>
