<p>Euphorbia polycephala, commonly known as the "Cape Town spurge," is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia polycephala is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
