                    <h1>Eugenia cyanophylla</h1>
<p>Eugenia cyanophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf eucalyptus, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers, a feature common among many eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>Eugenia cyanophylla is often found in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
