                    <h1>Eryngium glaciale</h1>
<p>Eryngium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier eryngium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spiky flower heads, which are surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Eryngium glaciale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
