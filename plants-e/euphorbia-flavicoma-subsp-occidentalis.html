<p>Euphorbia flavicoma subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western yellow euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
