                    <h1>Euphorbia geyeri var. geyeri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia geyeri var. geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
