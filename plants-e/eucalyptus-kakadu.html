<p>Eucalyptus kakadu, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for both traditional and modern uses.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus kakadu plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
