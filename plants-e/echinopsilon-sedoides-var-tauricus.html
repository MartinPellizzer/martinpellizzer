<p>Echinopsilon sedoides var. tauricus, commonly known as the Tauric sandthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in semi-desert and steppe environments.</p>
