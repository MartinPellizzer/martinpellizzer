<p>Equisetum praealtum f. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces both sterile and fertile stems, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobili.
