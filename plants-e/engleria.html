                    <h1>Engleria</h1>
<p>Engleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. Engleria typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without drawing nutrients from them. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, showy blooms that often appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Engleria is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
