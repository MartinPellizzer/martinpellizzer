<p>Echinopsis mamillosa subsp.</p>
<p>silvatica, commonly known as the Silvatic Echinopsis, is a succulent cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>The plant has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
