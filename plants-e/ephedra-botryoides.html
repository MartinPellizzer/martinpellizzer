                    <h1>Ephedra botryoides</h1>
<p>Ephedra botryoides, commonly known as the clustered ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties.</p>
