                    <h1>Epitrachys erythrolepis</h1>
<p>Epitrachys erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-scaled flatleaf, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of red or orange-colored hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Epitrachys erythrolepis is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
