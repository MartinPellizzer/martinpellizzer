<p>Elaphoglossum campylolepium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum campylolepium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture.</p>
