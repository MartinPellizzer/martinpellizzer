                    <h1>Eleocharis polymorpha</h1>
<p>Eleocharis polymorpha, commonly known as the spike rush, is a species of sedge native to wetlands and marshy areas across the globe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis polymorpha is also valued for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, including fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
