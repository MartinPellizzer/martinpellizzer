                    <h1>Euphorbia obovalifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia obovalifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
