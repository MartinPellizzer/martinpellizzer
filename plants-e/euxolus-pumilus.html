                    <h1>Euxolus pumilus</h1>
<p>Euxolus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by unique, bract-like structures. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>Euxolus pumilus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
