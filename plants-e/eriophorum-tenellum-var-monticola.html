<p>Eriophorum tenellum var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain cotton grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that resemble cotton, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments.</p>
