                    <h1>Euphorbia resinifera var. chlorosoma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia resinifera var. chlorosoma, commonly known as the green tree euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its resinous sap, which is toxic and sticky, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
