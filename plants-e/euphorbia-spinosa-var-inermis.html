                    <h1>Euphorbia spinosa var. inermis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spinosa var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, branched stem covered in soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care.</p>
