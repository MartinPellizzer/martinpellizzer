                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile f. virgatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile f. virgatum, commonly known as the slender field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila at the tips of its stems, which are cylindrical and often referred to as "spore cones.". It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more slender and less robust stems compared to the typical form of Equisetum fluviatile.</p>
