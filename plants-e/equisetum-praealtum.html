<p>Equisetum praealtum, commonly known as the tall horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Equisetum praealtum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living plants on Earth.</p>
