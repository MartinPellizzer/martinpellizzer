                    <h1>Elymus crinitus</h1>
<p>Elymus crinitus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tall, slender flowering stalks that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Elymus crinitus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
