<p>Ernestia tenella var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
