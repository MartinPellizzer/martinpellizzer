                    <h1>Euphorbia lancifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences rather than true flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
