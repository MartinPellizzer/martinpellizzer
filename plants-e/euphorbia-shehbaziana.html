<p>Euphorbia shehbaziana, commonly known as the Kashmir spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to rocky and mountainous terrains.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
