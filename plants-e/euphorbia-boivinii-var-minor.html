                    <h1>Euphorbia boivinii var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia boivinii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, woolly white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
