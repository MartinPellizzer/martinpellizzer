<p>Echinops hoffmannianus, commonly known as the Hoffmann's thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a striking feature of the plant. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinops hoffmannianus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
