                    <h1>Entomophobia</h1>
<p>Entomophobia, commonly known as the fear of insects, is not a plant but a specific phobia.</p>
<p>It is a psychological condition rather than a botanical term. The term itself does not refer to any plant species or botanical characteristics. However, it may be confused with the scientific name of certain plants that have insect-related properties.</p>
<p>This phobia is unrelated to the study of plants or botanical science.</p>
