<p>Eleocharis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a short-lived perennial that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis spiralis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
