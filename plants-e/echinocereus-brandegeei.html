                    <h1>Echinocereus brandegeei</h1>
<p>Echinocereus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are often followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
