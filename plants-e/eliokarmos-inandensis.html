<p>Eliokarmos inandensis, commonly known as the Andean mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest clearings. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eliokarmos inandensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
