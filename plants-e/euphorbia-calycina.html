                    <h1>Euphorbia calycina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia calycina, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched, woody stem covered in short, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia calycina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
