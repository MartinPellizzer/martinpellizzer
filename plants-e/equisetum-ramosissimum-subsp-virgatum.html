<p>Equisetum ramosissimum subsp.</p>
<p>virgatum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of sterile and fertile stems, with the latter producing spores in cone-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant features a hollow, jointed stem covered in sharp, tooth-like structures called annulate nodes. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making it one of the oldest living seedless vascular plants.</p>
