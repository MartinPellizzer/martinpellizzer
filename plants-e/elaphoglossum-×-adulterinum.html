                    <h1>Elaphoglossum × adulterinum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum × adulterinum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Elaphoglossum nudum and Elaphoglossum corydorphum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, often with a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
