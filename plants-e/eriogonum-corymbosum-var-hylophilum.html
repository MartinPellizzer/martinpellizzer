<p>Eriogonum corymbosum var. hylophilum, commonly known as the Sierra goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and hillsides. It has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
