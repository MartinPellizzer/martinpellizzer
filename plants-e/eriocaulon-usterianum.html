<p>Eriocaulon usterianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon usterianum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
