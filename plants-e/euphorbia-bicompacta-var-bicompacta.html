                    <h1>Euphorbia bicompacta var. bicompacta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bicompacta var. bicompacta, commonly known as the compact euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
