                    <h1>Epilobium karsteniae</h1>
<p>Epilobium karsteniae, commonly known as the Karstenâ€™s willow herb, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Epilobium karsteniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
