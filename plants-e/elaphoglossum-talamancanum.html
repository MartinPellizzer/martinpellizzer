                    <h1>Elaphoglossum talamancanum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum talamancanum, commonly known as the Talamancan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica and Panama, it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its value in horticultural collections.</p>
