<p>Epidendrum urostachyum, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with green veins, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and dark green, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Epidendrum urostachyum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
