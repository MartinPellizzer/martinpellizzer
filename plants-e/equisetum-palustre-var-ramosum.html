<p>Equisetum palustre var. ramosum, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found in the upper portions of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
