                    <h1>Elaphanthera</h1>
<p>Elaphanthera, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions in Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia, where they typically grow in rocky or wooded areas. Elaphanthera species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers, often with a striking color contrast between the petals and sepals. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Elaphanthera are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
