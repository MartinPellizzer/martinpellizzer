                    <h1>Elaphoglossum robinsonii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of forests.</p>
