                    <h1>Euonymus rigidus</h1>
<p>Euonymus rigidus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing shrubs. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Euonymus rigidus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
