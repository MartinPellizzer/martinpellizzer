<p>Eremopyrum bonaepartis var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy eremopyrum, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
