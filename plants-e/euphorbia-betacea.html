                    <h1>Euphorbia betacea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia betacea, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, yellowish-green stems that often branch out into a bushy form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia betacea is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
