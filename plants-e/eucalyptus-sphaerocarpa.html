                    <h1>Eucalyptus sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are often red or pink, which give the species its common name. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its timber and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands.</p>
