                    <h1>Equisetum debile var. pashan</h1>
<p>Equisetum debile var. pashan, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that exhibits distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves as seen in many other plants.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils.</p>
