                    <h1>Erianthus biaristatus</h1>
<p>Erianthus biaristatus, commonly known as the silverleaf bluestem, is a tall grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, slender inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for prairies and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
