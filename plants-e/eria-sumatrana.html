<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Eria sumatrana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
