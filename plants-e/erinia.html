                    <h1>Erinia</h1>
<p>Erinia, commonly known as the common ergot, is a parasitic plant that infects the spikes of rye and other grasses.</p>
<p>It produces a dark, hard sclerotium that contains alkaloids, which can be toxic to humans and animals. The plant belongs to the Claviceps genus and is part of the fungal kingdom, not a true plant. Its presence can lead to ergotism, a serious illness affecting the nervous system.</p>
<p>Erinia has historical significance in both agriculture and medicine due to its complex chemical composition.</p>
