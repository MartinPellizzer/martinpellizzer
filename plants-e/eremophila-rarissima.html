                    <h1>Eremophila rarissima</h1>
<p>Eremophila rarissima, commonly known as the rare emu bush, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
