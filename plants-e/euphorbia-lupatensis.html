<p>Euphorbia lupatensis, commonly known as the Lupa's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lupatensis is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
