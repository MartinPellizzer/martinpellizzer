                    <h1>Elymus junceus var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Elymus junceus var. caespitosus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits.</p>
