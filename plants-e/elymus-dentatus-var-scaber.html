                    <h1>Elymus dentatus var. scaber</h1>
<p>Elymus dentatus var. scaber, commonly known as rough toothgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and stiff, rough-textured leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely pubescent leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
