<p>Echinopsis turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Echinopsis turbinata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
