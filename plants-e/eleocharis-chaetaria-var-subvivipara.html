                    <h1>Eleocharis chaetaria var. subvivipara</h1>
<p>Eleocharis chaetaria var. subvivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One notable botanical feature is its viviparous habit, where some of the plant's shoots develop into small, mature plants while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in vegetative propagation and enhances its survival in fluctuating wetland conditions.</p>
