<p>Equisetum giganteum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like structures, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Equisetum giganteum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments.</p>
