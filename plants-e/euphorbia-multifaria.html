                    <h1>Euphorbia multifaria</h1>
<p>Euphorbia multifaria, commonly known as the coral tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with numerous small, leafless branches that resemble coral-like structures. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia multifaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
