<p>Eremophila granitica, commonly known as the granite emu plant, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid, and sandy soils, adapting well to dry and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot climates.</p>
<p>Eremophila granitica is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees.</p>
