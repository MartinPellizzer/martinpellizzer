<p>Elaphoglossum carnosum, commonly known as the meaty holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in efficient photosynthesis and water retention.</p>
