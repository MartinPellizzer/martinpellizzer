                    <h1>Epilobium montanum var. saxatile</h1>
<p>Epilobium montanum var. saxatile, commonly known as the alpine willow herb, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
