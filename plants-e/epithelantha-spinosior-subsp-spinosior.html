<p>Epithelantha spinosior subsp.</p>
<p>spinosior, commonly known as the spiny nightshade cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem and spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nightshade plants. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced spines compared to other variants within the species.</p>
