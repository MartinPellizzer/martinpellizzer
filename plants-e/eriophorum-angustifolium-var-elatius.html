                    <h1>Eriophorum angustifolium var. elatius</h1>
<p>Eriophorum angustifolium var. elatius, commonly known as slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which contribute to soil stabilization and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is often used as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
