<p>Ephedra sinica subsp.</p>
<p>dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian ephedra, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically absent except during the growing season.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments. It contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
