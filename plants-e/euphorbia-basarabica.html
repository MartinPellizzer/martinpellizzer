<p>Euphorbia basarabica, commonly known as the Basarabica spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, which can be irritating, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
