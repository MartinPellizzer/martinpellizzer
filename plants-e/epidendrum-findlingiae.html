<p>Epidendrum findlingiae, commonly known as the Findling's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a reddish throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
