<p>Epipactis mecsekensis, commonly known as the Mecsek orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Hungary.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often pale green or yellowish-white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
