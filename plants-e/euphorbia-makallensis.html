                    <h1>Euphorbia makallensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia makallensis, commonly known as the Makallan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia makallensis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
