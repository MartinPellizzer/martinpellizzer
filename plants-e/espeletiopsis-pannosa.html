<p>Espeletiopsis pannosa, commonly known as the pannose espeletiopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Espeletiopsis pannosa is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
