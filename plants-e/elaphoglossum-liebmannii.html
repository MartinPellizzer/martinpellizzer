<p>Elaphoglossum liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum liebmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
