<p>It features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
