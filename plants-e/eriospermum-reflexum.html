<p>Eriospermum reflexum, commonly known as the narrowleaf eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and reflexed, meaning they curve backward, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
