<p>Eragrostis majungensis, commonly known as the Majungensis lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
