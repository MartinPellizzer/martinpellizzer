                    <h1>Ephemerantha heterobulba</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha heterobulba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It has a unique root system composed of aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
