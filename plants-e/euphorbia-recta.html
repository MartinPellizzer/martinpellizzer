<p>Euphorbia recta, commonly known as the straight euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive upright growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stem, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia recta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
