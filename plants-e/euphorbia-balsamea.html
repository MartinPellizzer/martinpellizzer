                    <h1>Euphorbia balsamea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia balsamea, commonly known as blistering euphorbia, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a smooth, succulent stem covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a potentially hazardous plant to handle.</p>
<p>Euphorbia balsamea thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides.</p>
