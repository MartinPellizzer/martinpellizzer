<p>Eucalyptus capitellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf malletwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, peeling bark that becomes fibrous with age. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue and a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its timber and has some medicinal uses due to the presence of eucalyptus oils.</p>
