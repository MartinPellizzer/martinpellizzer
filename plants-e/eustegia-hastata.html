                    <h1>Eustegia hastata</h1>
<p>Eustegia hastata, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soil.</p>
<p>Eustegia hastata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
