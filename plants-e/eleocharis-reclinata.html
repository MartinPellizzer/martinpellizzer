<p>Eleocharis reclinata, commonly known as the drooping spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed berries.</p>
<p>Eleocharis reclinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
