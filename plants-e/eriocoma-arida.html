<p>Eriocoma arida, commonly known as the desert eriocoma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eriocoma arida is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
