<p>Eucalyptus incerata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically open to reveal white or pale pink flowers. Its bark is often flaky and peels away in thin layers, revealing a smooth, pale underbark.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus incerata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat.</p>
