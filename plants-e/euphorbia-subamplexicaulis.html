                    <h1>Euphorbia subamplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching stem covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and rockeries.</p>
