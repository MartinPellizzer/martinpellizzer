                    <h1>Eulophia lunata</h1>
<p>Eulophia lunata, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green with a striking yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often form a rosette, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Eulophia lunata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
