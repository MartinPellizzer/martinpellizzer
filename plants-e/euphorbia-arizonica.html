                    <h1>Euphorbia arizonica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia arizonica plays a role in supporting local wildlife, although its toxicity limits its use in horticulture.</p>
