                    <h1>Elaeagnus montana</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus montana, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
