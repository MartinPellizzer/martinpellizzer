<p>Elaphoglossum subcuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in habit. The plant features small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae with a distinct, subacute to acute apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the abaxial side of the fronds, typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
