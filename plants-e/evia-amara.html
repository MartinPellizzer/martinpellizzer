<p>Evia amara, commonly known as bitterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves that contain a bitter compound. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, due to its strong bitterness, it is typically prepared with other ingredients to mitigate its taste.</p>
