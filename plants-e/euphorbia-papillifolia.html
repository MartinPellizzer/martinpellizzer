<p>Euphorbia papillifolia, commonly known as the papillate spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or papillae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
