                    <h1>Euphorbia glomerifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia glomerifera, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, green, fleshy stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant.</p>
