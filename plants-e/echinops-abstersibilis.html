                    <h1>Echinops abstersibilis</h1>
<p>Echinops abstersibilis, commonly known as the desert hedgehog, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a hedgehog, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Echinops abstersibilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
