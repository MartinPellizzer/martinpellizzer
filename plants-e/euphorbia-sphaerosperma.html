                    <h1>Euphorbia sphaerosperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sphaerosperma, commonly known as the spherical spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a crown-like structure, which are borne on short, leafless stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sphaerosperma is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
