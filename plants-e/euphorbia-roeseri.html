                    <h1>Euphorbia roeseri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia roeseri, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped, providing a protective mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia roeseri is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
