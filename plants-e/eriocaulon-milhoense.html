<p>Eriocaulon milhoense, commonly known as the Brazilian spikerush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its habitat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon milhoense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
