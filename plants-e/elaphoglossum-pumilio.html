<p>Elaphoglossum pumilio, commonly known as the small fern or miniature holly fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum pumilio thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
