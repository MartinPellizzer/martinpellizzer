                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus vanderaeyi</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus vanderaeyi, commonly known as the Vanderaeyi cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are clustered at the ends of the stems, adding a vibrant contrast to its green foliage. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
