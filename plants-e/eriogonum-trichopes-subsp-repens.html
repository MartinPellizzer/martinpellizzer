<p>Eriogonum trichopes subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
