                    <h1>Erodium bipinnatum var. sabulicola</h1>
<p>Erodium bipinnatum var. sabulicola, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to colonize open spaces, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
