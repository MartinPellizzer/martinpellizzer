                    <h1>Erysimum linifolium var. filifolium</h1>
<p>Erysimum linifolium var. filifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures that attach to the roots of its host. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters, adding visual interest to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
