                    <h1>Euphorbia impervia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia impervia, commonly known as the desert croton, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
