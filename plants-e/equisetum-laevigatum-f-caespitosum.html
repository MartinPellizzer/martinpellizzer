                    <h1>Equisetum laevigatum f. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum laevigatum f. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted horse tail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. This fern is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain wetland ecosystems.</p>
