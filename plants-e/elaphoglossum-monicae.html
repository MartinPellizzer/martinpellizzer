<p>Elaphoglossum monicae, commonly known as the Monica's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum monicae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
