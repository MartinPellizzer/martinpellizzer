                <h1>Exodeconus maritimus</h1>
<p>Exodeconus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters that stabilize sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide additional protection against harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Exodeconus maritimus is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in areas with limited freshwater availability.</p>
