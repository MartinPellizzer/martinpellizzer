<p>Euphorbia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by vibrant green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Euphorbia mexicana is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
