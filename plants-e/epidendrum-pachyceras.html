<p>Epidendrum pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-leafed epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to grow in drier environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pachyceras is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
