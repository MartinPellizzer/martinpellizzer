<p>Equisetum arvense subsp.</p>
<p>riparium, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. It is typically found in moist or aquatic habitats such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its stems are hollow and contain silica, giving them a rigid, needle-like appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
