<p>Espeletia cochensis, commonly known as the white mountain heather, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Espeletia cochensis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
