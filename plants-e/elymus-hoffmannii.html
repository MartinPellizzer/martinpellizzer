<p>Elymus hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Elymus hoffmannii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
