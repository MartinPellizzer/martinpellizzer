                    <h1>Euroschinus sylvicola</h1>
<p>Euroschinus sylvicola, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk, which are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the nuts, contributing to its spread across forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant has significant ecological and economic importance, particularly in forestry and wildlife habitats.</p>
