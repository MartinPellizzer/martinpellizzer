                    <h1>Euphorbia aculeata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and spiny structure, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling.</p>
