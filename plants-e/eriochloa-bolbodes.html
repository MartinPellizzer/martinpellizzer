                    <h1>Eriochloa bolbodes</h1>
<p>Eriochloa bolbodes, commonly known as the clustered lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers, typically with two to three bract-like structures at the base. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in short, stiff hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Eriochloa bolbodes is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
