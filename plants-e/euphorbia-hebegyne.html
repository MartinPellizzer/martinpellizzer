                    <h1>Euphorbia hebegyne</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hebegyne, commonly known as the Cape Harebell, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hebegyne is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
