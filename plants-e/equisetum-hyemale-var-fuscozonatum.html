                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. fuscozonatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. fuscozonatum, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail, characterized by its distinctive dark green, segmented stems covered in rough, prickly ridges.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its dark zonation patterns along the stem, giving it a unique appearance among horsetails.</p>
