                    <h1>Euphrasia humifusa</h1>
<p>Euphrasia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that hug the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals and a distinctive spurred lower petal, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue.</p>
<p>Euphrasia humifusa is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain largely under-researched.</p>
