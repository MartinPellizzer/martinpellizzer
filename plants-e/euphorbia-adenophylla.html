<p>Euphorbia adenophylla, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, known as latex, contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia adenophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
