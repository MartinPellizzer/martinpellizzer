                    <h1>Euphorbia rhombifolia var. triceps</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rhombifolia var. triceps, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
