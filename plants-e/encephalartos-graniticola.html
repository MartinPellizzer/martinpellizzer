                    <h1>Encephalartos graniticola</h1>
<p>Encephalartos graniticola, commonly known as the granite cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its cones are small and inconspicuous, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
