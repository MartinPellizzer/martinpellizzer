<p>Eriospermum algiferum, commonly known as the saltbush or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Eriospermum algiferum is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils near the coast, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
