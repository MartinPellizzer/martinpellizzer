                    <h1>Eucalyptus ammophila</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus ammophila, commonly known as the sandplain gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common feature of coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
