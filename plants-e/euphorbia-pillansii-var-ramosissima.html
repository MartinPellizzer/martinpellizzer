<p>Euphorbia pillansii var. ramosissima, commonly known as the skeleton bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched stems that are covered in a waxy, pale-green cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
