<p>Epithelantha micromeris subsp.</p>
<p>unguispina, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
