<p>Euphorbia malevola, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a spiny, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in sharp, reddish-brown spines that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often deciduous, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia malevola is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
