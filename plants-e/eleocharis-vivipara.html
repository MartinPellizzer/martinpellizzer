<p>Eleocharis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a species of sedges native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive strategy where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Eleocharis vivipara plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
