                    <h1>Elymus salsuginosus</h1>
<p>Elymus salsuginosus, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Elymus salsuginosus is adapted to thrive in soils with high salinity and poor nutrients, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ecological role in preventing soil erosion make it a valuable plant in restoration projects.</p>
