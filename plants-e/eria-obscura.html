                    <h1>Eria obscura</h1>
<p>Eria obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, often without leaves, relying on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Eria obscura is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
