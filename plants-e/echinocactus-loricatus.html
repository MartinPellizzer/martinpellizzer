<p>Echinocactus loricatus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which serve as sites for the production of glochids and flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinocactus loricatus is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
