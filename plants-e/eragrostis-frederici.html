<p>Eragrostis frederici, commonly known as coastal lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in coastal areas with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
