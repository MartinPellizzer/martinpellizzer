                    <h1>Eriocaulon naviculum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon naviculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
