<p>Euphorbia denisiana, commonly known as the Denisian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia denisiana is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
