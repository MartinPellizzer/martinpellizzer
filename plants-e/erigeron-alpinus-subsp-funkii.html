<p>Erigeron alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>funkii, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
