                    <h1>Eragrostis brownii var. schistacea</h1>
<p>Eragrostis brownii var. schistacea, commonly known as the schistaceous lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
