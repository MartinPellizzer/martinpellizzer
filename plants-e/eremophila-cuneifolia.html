                    <h1>Eremophila cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Eremophila cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Eremophila cuneifolia is often used in dryland landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
