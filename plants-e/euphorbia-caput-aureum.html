The plant produces striking yellow-orange cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences that resemble small crowns. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia caput-aureum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
