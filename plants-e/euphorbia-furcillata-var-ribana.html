                    <h1>Euphorbia furcillata var. ribana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia furcillata var. ribana, commonly known as the ribbed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, a feature common in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
