<p>Elsota welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as acacias, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Elsota welwitschii is notable for its ability to survive in arid environments and has adapted to thrive in the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
