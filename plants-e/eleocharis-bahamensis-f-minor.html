                    <h1>Eleocharis bahamensis f. minor</h1>
<p>Eleocharis bahamensis f. minor, commonly known as the Bahamian spike-rush, is a rare and small aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands, where it forms dense, grass-like clusters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or partially emergent, contributing to its ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
