                    <h1>Euphorbia falcata var. macrostegia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia falcata var. macrostegia, commonly known as the large-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by vibrant red bracts, making it visually striking. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in many succulents.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
