<p>Eutrema hederifolium, commonly known as the marsh cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in damp environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Eutrema hederifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
