<p>Equisetum × moorei nothosubsp.</p>
<p>nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese horse-tail, is a hybrid fern-like plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like stems. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique combination of primitive and modern features, including a stem that elongates through apical meristems and a lack of true leaves. Its spores are released from the terminal cones, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats.</p>
