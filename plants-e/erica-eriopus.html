                    <h1>Erica eriopus</h1>
<p>Erica eriopus, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Erica eriopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
