<p>Eragrostis mangalorica, commonly known as the Mangalore grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a common sight in mangrove areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis mangalorica plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
