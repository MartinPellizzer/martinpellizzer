                    <h1>Epipactis × stephensonii</h1>
<p>Epipactis × stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephenson's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it challenging to classify taxonomically.</p>
