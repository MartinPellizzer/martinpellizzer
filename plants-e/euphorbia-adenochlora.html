                    <h1>Euphorbia adenochlora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia adenochlora, commonly known as the desert euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia adenochlora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water needs and ornamental appearance.</p>
