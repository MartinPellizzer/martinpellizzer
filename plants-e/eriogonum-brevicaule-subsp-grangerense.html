<p>Eriogonum brevicaule subsp.</p>
<p>grangerense, commonly known as the Granger's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in dry climates.</p>
