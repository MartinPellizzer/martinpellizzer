                    <h1>Elymus racemosus var. sabulosus</h1>
<p>Elymus racemosus var. sabulosus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces airy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.</p>
