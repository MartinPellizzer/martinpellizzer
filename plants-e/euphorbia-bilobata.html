<p>Euphorbia bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed spurges, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and often have a distinctive lobed shape.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bilobata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
