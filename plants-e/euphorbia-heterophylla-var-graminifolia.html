<p>Euphorbia heterophylla var. graminifolia, commonly known as the grassleaf spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵 (cyathia) that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
