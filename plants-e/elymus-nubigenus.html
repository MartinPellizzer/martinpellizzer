                    <h1>Elymus nubigenus</h1>
<p>Elymus nubigenus, commonly known as the alpine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense tussocks and plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes. Elymus nubigenus is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient soils, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically small and spike-like, appearing in late summer and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
