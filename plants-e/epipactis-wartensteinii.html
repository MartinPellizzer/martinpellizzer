                    <h1>Epipactis wartensteinii</h1>
<p>Epipactis wartensteinii, commonly known as the Wartenstein helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
