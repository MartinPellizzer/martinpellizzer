<p>Epidendrum costatum, commonly known as the Costate Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum costatum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
