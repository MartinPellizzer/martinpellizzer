                    <h1>Eriophorum russeolum var. fallax</h1>
<p>Eriophorum russeolum var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Eriophorum russeolum.</p>
