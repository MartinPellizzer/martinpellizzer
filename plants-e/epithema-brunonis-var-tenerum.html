                    <h1>Epithema brunonis var. tenerum</h1>
<p>Epithema brunonis var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft epithema, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
