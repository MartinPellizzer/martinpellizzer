<p>Eritrichium borchersii, commonly known as the Borchers' alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Eritrichium borchersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
