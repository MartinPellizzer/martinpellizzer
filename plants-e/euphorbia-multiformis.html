                    <h1>Euphorbia multiformis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia multiformis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with numerous cylindrical, fleshy branches that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, waxy leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The plant also exudes a milky, toxic sap when injured, which serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
