                    <h1>Eriocoma aschenbornii</h1>
<p>Eriocoma aschenbornii, commonly known as the Aschenborn's eriocoma, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eriocoma aschenbornii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
