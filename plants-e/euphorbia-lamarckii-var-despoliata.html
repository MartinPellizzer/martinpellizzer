                    <h1>Euphorbia lamarckii var. despoliata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lamarckii var. despoliata, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
