<p>Euzomum vesicarium, commonly known as the blister bladder, is a member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its bladdery, inflated stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments.
