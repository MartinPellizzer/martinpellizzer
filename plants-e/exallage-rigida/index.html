                            <h1>Exallage Rigida</h1>
<p>Rigid exallage, scientifically known as Exallage rigida, is a unique and resilient plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and distinctive, often spiky foliage that helps it thrive in arid environments. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a fascinating subject for botanists and horticulturists alike. Its ability to store water in its leaves and stems allows it to endure prolonged droughts. Despite its tough appearance, Exallage rigida holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
