<p>Epigeneium gracilipes, commonly known as the slender epigee, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its thin, vine-like stems that ascend along trees or other supports. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Epigeneium gracilipes is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
