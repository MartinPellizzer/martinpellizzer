                    <h1>Euphorbia leonensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
