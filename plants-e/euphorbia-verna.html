<p>Euphorbia verna, commonly known as early euphorbia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its stems are covered in a white, powdery substance known as a pruina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia verna is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species.</p>
