<p>Elytrigia ikonnikovii, commonly known as the Ikonnikov's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
