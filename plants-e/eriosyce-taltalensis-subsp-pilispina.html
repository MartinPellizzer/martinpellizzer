<p>Eriosyce taltalensis subsp.</p>
<p>pilispina, commonly known as the Taltal spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny tubercles, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils along the coast.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
