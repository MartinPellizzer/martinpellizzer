                    <h1>Euphorbia characias f. maritima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia characias f. maritima, commonly known as the sea spurge or coastal euphorbia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping.</p>
