                    <h1>Eucalyptus regnans</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus regnans, commonly known as the mountain ash, is a tall evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is notable for being one of the tallest flowering plants in the world, with some specimens reaching heights of over 100 meters. The tree has smooth, peeling bark that is often a striking white or grey color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and coated with a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry environment.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and produce nectar that attracts a variety of pollinators.</p>
