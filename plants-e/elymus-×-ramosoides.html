<p>Elymus × ramosoides, commonly known as the silvergrass or bearded wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Elymus × ramosoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
