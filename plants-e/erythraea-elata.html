                    <h1>Erythraea elata</h1>
<p>Erythraea elata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
