                    <h1>Eurychone</h1>
<p>Eurychone, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Eurychone plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
