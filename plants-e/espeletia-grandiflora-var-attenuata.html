                    <h1>Espeletia grandiflora var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Espeletia grandiflora var. attenuata, commonly known as the "Páramo Flower," is a striking plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like foliage composed of thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the fragile páramo ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
