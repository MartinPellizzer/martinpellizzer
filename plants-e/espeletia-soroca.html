<p>Espeletia soroca, commonly known as the "soroca" or "snow mountain" plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude, arid environment. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia soroca plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for local pollinators.</p>
