<p>Eccremanthus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their striking, tubular or funnel-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. Eccremanthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors.</p>
