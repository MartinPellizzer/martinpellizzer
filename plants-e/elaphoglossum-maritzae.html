<p>Elaphoglossum maritzae, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils near the coast. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum maritzae plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
