                    <h1>Enneapogon dipsaceus</h1>
<p>Enneapogon dipsaceus, commonly known as the slender grass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
