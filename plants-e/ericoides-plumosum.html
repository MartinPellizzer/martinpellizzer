                    <h1>Ericoides plumosum</h1>
<p>Ericoides plumosum, commonly known as the plumose heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Ericoides plumosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
