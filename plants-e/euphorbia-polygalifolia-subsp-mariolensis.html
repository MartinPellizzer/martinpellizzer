<p>Euphorbia polygalifolia subsp.</p>
<p>mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolensian spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
