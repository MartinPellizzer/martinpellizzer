                    <h1>Euphorbia longeramosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia longeramosa, commonly known as the long-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with a thick, fleshy trunk that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in many succulents.</p>
<p>Euphorbia longeramosa is also characterized by its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
