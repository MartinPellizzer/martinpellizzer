                    <h1>Eucalyptus dealbata var. populnea</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus dealbata var. populnea, commonly known as the silky gum, is a medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silky white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber and medicinal properties.</p>
