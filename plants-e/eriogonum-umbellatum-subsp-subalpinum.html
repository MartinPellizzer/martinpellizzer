<p>Eriogonum umbellatum subsp.</p>
<p>subalpinum, commonly known as the subalpine buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and high elevations, making it a key component of subalpine ecosystems.</p>
