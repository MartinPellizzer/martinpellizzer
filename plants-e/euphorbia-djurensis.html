<p>Euphorbia djurensis, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia djurensis is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
