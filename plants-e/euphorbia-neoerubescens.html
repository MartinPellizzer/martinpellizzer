                    <h1>Euphorbia neoerubescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neoerubescens, commonly known as the red-spotted euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in bright red and yellow spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow花朵 that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
