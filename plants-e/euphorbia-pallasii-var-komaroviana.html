                    <h1>Euphorbia pallasii var. komaroviana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pallasii var. komaroviana, commonly known as the Komaroviana spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates.</p>
