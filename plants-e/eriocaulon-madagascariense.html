<p>Eriocaulon madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is adapted to humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
