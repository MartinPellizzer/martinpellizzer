                    <h1>Euphorbia serrata f. ternata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serrata f. ternata, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of many succulents. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
