<p>Elaphoglossum simonsianum, commonly known as the Simonsian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum simonsianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
