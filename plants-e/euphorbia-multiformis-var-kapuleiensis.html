                    <h1>Euphorbia multiformis var. kapuleiensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia multiformis var. kapuleiensis, commonly known as the Kapulei euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
