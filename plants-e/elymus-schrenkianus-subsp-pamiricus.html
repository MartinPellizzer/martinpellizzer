<p>Elymus schrenkianus subsp.</p>
<p>pamiricus, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, needle-like leaves adapted to cold and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky and mountainous terrain, often found in alpine meadows and steppe zones.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
