                    <h1>Euphorbia × sooi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia × sooi, commonly known as the hybrid spurge, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
