                    <h1>Euphorbia stegmatica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stegmatica, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia stegmatica is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
