                    <h1>Erythroxylum fraternum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum fraternum, commonly known as the red-eyed woodpecker plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Erythroxylaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its oval-shaped, glossy leaves. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance, which aids in seed dispersal by ants.</p>
<p>Erythroxylum fraternum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological interactions.</p>
