                    <h1>Euphorbia pallens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pallens, commonly known as the pale spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, so care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pallens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions.</p>
