                    <h1>Echinocactus griseispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus griseispinus, commonly known as the blue spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in white to blue spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its blue-green foliage. It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
