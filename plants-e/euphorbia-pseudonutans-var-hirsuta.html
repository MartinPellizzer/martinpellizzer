                    <h1>Euphorbia pseudonutans var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pseudonutans var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a variant of the spurge plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, thick, and fleshy stems that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emerge from a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
