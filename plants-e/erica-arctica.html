<p>Erica arctica, commonly known as the Arctic heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is well adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems.</p>
<p>Erica arctica plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is a symbol of resilience in cold climates.</p>
