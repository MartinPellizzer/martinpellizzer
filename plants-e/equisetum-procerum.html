                    <h1>Equisetum procerum</h1>
<p>Equisetum procerum, commonly known as the tall scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem that is often used for its abrasive properties. The plant produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called strobila. Equisetum procerum is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and can be an indicator plant for certain environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
