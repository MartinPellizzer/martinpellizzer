<p>Eucalyptus exserta var. parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved malleeflower, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee and dry forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
