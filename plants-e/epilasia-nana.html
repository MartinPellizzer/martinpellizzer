                    <h1>Epilasia nana</h1>
<p>Epilasia nana, commonly known as dwarf epilasia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, rosette-like foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which provide insulation and reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Epilasia nana is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
