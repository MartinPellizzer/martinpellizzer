<p>Elatinoides brunneri, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Elatinoides brunneri is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
