                    <h1>Epilobium tetragonum var. tournefortii</h1>
<p>Epilobium tetragonum var. tournefortii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
