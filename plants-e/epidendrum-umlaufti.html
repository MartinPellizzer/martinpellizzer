                    <h1>Epidendrum umlaufti</h1>
<p>Epidendrum umlaufti, commonly known as the Umlauff's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, helping it store water in its native humid environments.</p>
<p>Epidendrum umlaufti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
