<p>Echinocystis muricata, commonly known as the spiny globe gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to spherical, green fruits with a bumpy, spiny surface. The fruit matures to a pale yellow or orange color and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
