                    <h1>Echinocactus texensis var. treculianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus texensis var. treculianus, commonly known as the Trecul's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spine-tipped cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, sharp spines and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. It is typically found growing in rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other echinocactus species but is distinguished by its unique spination and growth form.</p>
