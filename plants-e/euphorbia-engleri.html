                    <h1>Euphorbia engleri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia engleri, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia engleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
