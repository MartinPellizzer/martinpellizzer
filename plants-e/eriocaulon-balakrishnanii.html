<p>Eriocaulon balakrishnanii, commonly known as the Balakrishnan's needlegrass, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
