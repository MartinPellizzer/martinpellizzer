<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, typically in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert margins and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
