                    <h1>Elaphoglossum heterochroum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum heterochroum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
