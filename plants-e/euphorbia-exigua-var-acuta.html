                    <h1>Euphorbia exigua var. acuta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exigua var. acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sharply pointed leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. The plant contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
