<p>Elymus sclerus, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus sclerus is adapted to grow in harsh, arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ability to thrive in poor conditions make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
