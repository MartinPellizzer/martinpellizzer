                    <h1>Echinopsis mataranensis</h1>
<p>Echinopsis mataranensis, commonly known as the Mataranensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of spiny, white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and help reduce water loss. Its adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived, opening only briefly before closing during the day.</p>
