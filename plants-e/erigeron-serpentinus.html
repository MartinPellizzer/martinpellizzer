                    <h1>Erigeron serpentinus</h1>
<p>Erigeron serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The showy white to pale blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
