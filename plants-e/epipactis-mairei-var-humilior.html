                    <h1>Epipactis mairei var. humilior</h1>
<p>Epipactis mairei var. humilior, commonly known as the Maire's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, humusy soils. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
