                            <h1>Euphorbia Umbellata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia umbellata is a unique member of the spurge family known for its striking appearance and ecological significance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant thrives in harsh environments where few others can survive. Its most distinctive feature is its umbellate inflorescence, which resembles a cluster of tiny flowers. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation. This resilient plant plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting various forms of wildlife and contributing to desert biodiversity.</p>
