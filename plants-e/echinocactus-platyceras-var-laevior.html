                    <h1>Echinocactus platyceras var. laevior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus platyceras var. laevior, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles that bear white, woolly bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often surrounded by a ring of spines. Its thick, ribbed structure helps it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
