<p>Eragrostis calotheca, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas.</p>
