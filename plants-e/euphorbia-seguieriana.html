<p>Euphorbia seguieriana, commonly known as the Seguier's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching stem covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia seguieriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
