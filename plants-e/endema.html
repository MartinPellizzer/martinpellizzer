                    <h1>Endema</h1>
<p>Endema, commonly known as the endemic plant species found in specific geographic regions, is characterized by its unique adaptations to its native habitat.</p>
<p>These plants often exhibit specialized features such as modified leaves, flowers, or root systems that enable survival in their particular environment. Endema species are typically found in isolated areas like mountain ranges or islands, where they have evolved in isolation. Due to their limited distribution, many endema species are at risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these rare botanical treasures.</p>
