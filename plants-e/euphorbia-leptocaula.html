                    <h1>Euphorbia leptocaula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia leptocaula, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
