                    <h1>Ephemerantha puncticulosa</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha puncticulosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered.</p>
