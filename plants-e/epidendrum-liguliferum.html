<p>Epidendrum liguliferum, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum liguliferum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
