<p>Eremothera boothii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Eremothera boothii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
