                    <h1>Eragrostis sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Eragrostis sarmentosa, commonly known as silvergrass or dwarf silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
