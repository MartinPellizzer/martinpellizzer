                    <h1>Exorrhiza</h1>
<p>Exorrhiza, commonly known as the root-like structures in certain lichens, are specialized hyphal structures that anchor the lichen to the substrate.</p>
<p>These structures are not true roots but are composed of fungal hyphae that form a network for nutrient absorption. Exorrhiza play a crucial role in the lichen's ability to absorb water and minerals from the environment. They are often found on rocks, trees, or soil surfaces, depending on the lichen's habitat.</p>
<p>The presence and development of exorrhiza can vary based on environmental conditions and the specific lichen species.</p>
