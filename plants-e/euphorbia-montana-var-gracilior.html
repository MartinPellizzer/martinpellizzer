                    <h1>Euphorbia montana var. gracilior</h1>
<p>Euphorbia montana var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender mountain spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and striking floral display.</p>
