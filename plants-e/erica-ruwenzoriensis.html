<p>Erica ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori heath, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the East African mountains, particularly the Rwenzori Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and cranberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
