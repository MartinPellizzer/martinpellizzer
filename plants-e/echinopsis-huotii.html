<p>Echinopsis huotii, commonly known as the Huot's cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Echinopsis huotii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
