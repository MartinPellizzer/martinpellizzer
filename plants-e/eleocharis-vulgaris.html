<p>Eleocharis vulgaris, commonly known as common spike-rush, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis vulgaris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
