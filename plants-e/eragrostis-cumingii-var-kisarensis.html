<p>Eragrostis cumingii var. kisarensis, commonly known as the Kisar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Kisar in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute grains, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range.</p>
