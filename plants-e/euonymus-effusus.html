                    <h1>Euonymus effusus</h1>
<p>Euonymus effusus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
