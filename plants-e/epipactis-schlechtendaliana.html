                    <h1>Epipactis schlechtendaliana</h1>
<p>Epipactis schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the Schlechtendalian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower. The plant has specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on specific insects for reproduction. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, its populations are declining, making conservation efforts critical for its survival.</p>
