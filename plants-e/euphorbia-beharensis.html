                    <h1>Euphorbia beharensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia beharensis, commonly known as the St. Helena spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
