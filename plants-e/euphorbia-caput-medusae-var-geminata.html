                    <h1>Euphorbia caput-medusae var. geminata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caput-medusae var. geminata, commonly known as the "Medusa's Head" or "Devil's Fig," is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem with a distinctive crown of fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that resemble a crown or a flower. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green, surrounded by a fleshy, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
