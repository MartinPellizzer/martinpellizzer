<p>Escobaria deserti, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Escobaria, which includes several species of flowering plants adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant features a low-growing, cushion-like growth form with fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Escobaria deserti is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
