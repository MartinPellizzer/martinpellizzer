<p>Elaphoglossum lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindbergâ€™s holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Elaphoglossum lindbergii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
