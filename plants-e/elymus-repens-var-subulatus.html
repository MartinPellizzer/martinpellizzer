                    <h1>Elymus repens var. subulatus</h1>
<p>Elymus repens var. subulatus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to colonize degraded habitats.</p>
