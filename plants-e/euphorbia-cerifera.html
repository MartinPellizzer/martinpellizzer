<p>Euphorbia cerifera, commonly known as the wax plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by specialized bracts that resemble petals. Its sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cerifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
