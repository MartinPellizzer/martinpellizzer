<p>Euphorbia virosa subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
