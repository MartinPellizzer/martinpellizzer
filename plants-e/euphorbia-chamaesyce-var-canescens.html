                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. canescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesyce var. canescens, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
