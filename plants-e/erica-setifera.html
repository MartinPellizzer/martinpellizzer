                    <h1>Erica setifera</h1>
<p>Erica setifera, commonly known as the coastal heath or narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form with dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Erica setifera is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and conservation areas.</p>
