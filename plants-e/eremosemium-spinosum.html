                    <h1>Eremosemium spinosum</h1>
<p>Eremosemium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny eremosemium, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Eremosemium spinosum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes.</p>
