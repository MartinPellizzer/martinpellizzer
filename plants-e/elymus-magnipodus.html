<p>Elymus magnipodus, commonly known as the giant tansygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stature, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Elymus magnipodus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability.</p>
