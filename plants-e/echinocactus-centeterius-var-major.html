                    <h1>Echinocactus centeterius var. major</h1>
<p>Echinocactus centeterius var. major, commonly known as the Mexican giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens.</p>
