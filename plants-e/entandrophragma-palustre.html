                    <h1>Entandrophragma palustre</h1>
<p>Entandrophragma palustre, commonly known as the swamp teak, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber use, though it is now considered threatened due to habitat loss.</p>
