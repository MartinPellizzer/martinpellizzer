                    <h1>Echeveria valvata</h1>
<p>Echeveria valvata, commonly known as the Valley Fire Echeveria, is a succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a powdery coating that gives them a frosty appearance. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in late spring or early summer, which bloom on stalks that rise above the foliage. Echeveria valvata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and striking appearance make it a desirable addition to both outdoor and indoor collections.</p>
