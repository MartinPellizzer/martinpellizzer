<p>Euphorbia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
