<p>Echeveria laxa var. minor, commonly known as the compact echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are slightly spoon-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping.</p>
