                    <h1>Ericameria compacta</h1>
<p>Ericameria compacta, commonly known as silverleaf ericameria, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its yellow-green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Ericameria compacta is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
