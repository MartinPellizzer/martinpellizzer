                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis var. gracilinux</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis var. gracilinux, commonly known as the slender African oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender trunk and smaller leaves compared to the standard oil palm. The plant produces fruit clusters that contain oil-rich kernels, making it valuable for agricultural and industrial uses. It thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving oil yield and resilience.</p>
