                    <h1>Erica copiosa var. longicauda</h1>
<p>Erica copiosa var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, wiry stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the winter months. The plant is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal gardens with minimal maintenance.</p>
