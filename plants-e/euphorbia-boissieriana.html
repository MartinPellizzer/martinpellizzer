<p>Euphorbia boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia boissieriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
