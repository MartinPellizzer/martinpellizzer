                    <h1>Equisetum majus</h1>
<p>Equisetum majus, commonly known as horse tail, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like formations at the top of the stem. Equisetum majus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution.</p>
