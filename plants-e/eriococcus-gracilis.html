<p>Eriococcus gracilis, commonly known as the slender eriococcus, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Eriococcidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, soft body covered in a waxy, cotton-like coating. This plant parasite typically infests a variety of host plants, including ornamental shrubs and fruit trees. The colonies often form dense, felt-like masses on the stems and leaves of the host.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to secrete honeydew, it can lead to the growth of sooty mold, affecting the plant's health and appearance.</p>
