<p>Elephantorrhiza pubescens, commonly known as the African elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
