                    <h1>Elaphoglossum coracinolepis</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum coracinolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Elaphoglossum coracinolepis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
