<p>Euphorbia libassii, commonly known as the Libassii spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia libassii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
