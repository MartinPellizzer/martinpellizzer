                    <h1>Euphorbia trichocardia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia trichocardia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
