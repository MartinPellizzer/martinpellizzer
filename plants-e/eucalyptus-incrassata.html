                    <h1>Eucalyptus incrassata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mallee, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that typically range in color from white to pink, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus incrassata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, have been used in traditional and modern medicine for their antiseptic and decongestant properties.</p>
