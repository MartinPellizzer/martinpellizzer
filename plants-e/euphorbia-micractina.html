                    <h1>Euphorbia micractina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia micractina, commonly known as the miniature spurge, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
