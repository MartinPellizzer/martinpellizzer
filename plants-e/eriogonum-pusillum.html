                    <h1>Eriogonum pusillum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eriogonum pusillum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
