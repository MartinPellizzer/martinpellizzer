                    <h1>Ephemerum congestum</h1>
<p>Ephemerum congestum, commonly known as the clustered ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, succulent stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the warm season. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowering period is short-lived, often lasting only a few weeks, which is why it is referred to as an ephemeral.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
