                    <h1>Echeveria alata</h1>
<p>Echeveria alata, commonly known as the "Panda Plant," is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with pink or purple at the edges. The plant produces striking clusters of pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echeveria alata thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
