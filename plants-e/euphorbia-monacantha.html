                    <h1>Euphorbia monacantha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia monacantha, commonly known as the Monacan Thornplant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in spiny, cylindrical tubercles, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its sharp spines and toxic sap, it is often grown as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
