                    <h1>Echinocactus viznaga</h1>
<p>Echinocactus viznaga, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its green exterior. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus viznaga is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
