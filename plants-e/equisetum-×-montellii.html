                    <h1>Equisetum × montellii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × montellii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a species that results from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, segmented stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in late summer. Equisetum × montellii thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its recognition in botanical studies.</p>
