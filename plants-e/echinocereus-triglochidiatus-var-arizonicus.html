                    <h1>Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. arizonicus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
