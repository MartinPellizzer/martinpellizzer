<p>Eriogonum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
