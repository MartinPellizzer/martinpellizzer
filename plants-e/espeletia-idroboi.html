                    <h1>Espeletia idroboi</h1>
<p>Espeletia idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's espeletia, is a rosette-forming plant native to the p√°ramo ecosystems of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps retain moisture in the cold, high-altitude environment. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to anchor it in the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Espeletia idroboi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
