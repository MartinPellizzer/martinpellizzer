                    <h1>Elaphoglossum corderoanum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum corderoanum, commonly known as the Cordero's holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, pointed segments, giving it a finely serrated appearance. The fronds are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
