<p>Echinops chardinii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its woody stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Echinops chardinii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
