                    <h1>Epicycas</h1>
<p>Epicycas, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, palm-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Epicycas species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They produce cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they are often referred to as "living fossils" because they have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.</p>
