<p>Eucalyptus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty box gum, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that ranges from grey to reddish-brown, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus ferruginea plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
