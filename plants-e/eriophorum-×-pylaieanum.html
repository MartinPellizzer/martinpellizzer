                    <h1>Eriophorum × pylaieanum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum × pylaieanum, commonly known as the hybrid cottongrass, is a rare plant species resulting from the cross between Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fluffy, cotton-like seed heads that appear in late summer, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriophorum × pylaieanum is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
