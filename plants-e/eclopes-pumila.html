                    <h1>Eclopes pumila</h1>
<p>Eclopes pumila, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
