                            <h1>Endiandra Javanica</h1>
<p>Java endiandra, scientifically known as Endiandra javanica, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. This evergreen tree is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species. Due to deforestation and habitat loss, the Java endiandra is now critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a valuable subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
