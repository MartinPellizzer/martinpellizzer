<p>Elaphoglossum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit, with rhizomes that spread horizontally just beneath the soil surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum glabellum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
