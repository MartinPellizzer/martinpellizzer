                    <h1>Euphorbia rupestris</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rupestris is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
