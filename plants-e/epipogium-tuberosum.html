<p>Epipogium tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy tuber that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, hooded structure and showy labellum.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a protected species in several countries.</p>
