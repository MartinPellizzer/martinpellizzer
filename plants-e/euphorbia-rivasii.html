<p>Euphorbia rivasii, commonly known as the Rivas' spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rivasii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
