<p>Eleogenus laetovirens var. umbonatus, commonly known as the golden-veined fern, is a striking species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a distinctive golden hue along the veins of its leaves, which sets it apart from other fern varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait in the botanical world.</p>
<p>This unique combination of color and light makes it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and researchers.</p>
