The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a modified leaf called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
