<p>Eriocaulon subuncinatum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized aquatic or wetland habitat.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often densely packed, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas.</p>
