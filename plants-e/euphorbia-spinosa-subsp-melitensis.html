<p>Euphorbia spinosa subsp.</p>
<p>melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and surrounding islands. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
