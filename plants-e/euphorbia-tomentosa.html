                    <h1>Euphorbia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
