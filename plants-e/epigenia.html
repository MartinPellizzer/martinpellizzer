                    <h1>Epigenia</h1>
<p>Epigenia, commonly known as the "satanic orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Brazil. Epigenia species are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small, intricate insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting flies. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations and role in their ecosystems.</p>
