<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>umbrae, commonly known as the shaded helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to shaded forest understories in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinct, often fragrant lip.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
