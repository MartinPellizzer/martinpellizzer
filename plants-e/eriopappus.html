                    <h1>Eriopappus</h1>
<p>Eriopappus, commonly known as the "goatweed," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often hairy, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Eriopappus species are native to North and South America and are adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and dry slopes.</p>
<p>Their seed dispersal mechanism involves a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind pollination and seed distribution.</p>
