                    <h1>Euphorbia gummifera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gummifera, commonly known as the gum arabic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is the source of gum arabic, a substance used in food and pharmaceutical industries. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
