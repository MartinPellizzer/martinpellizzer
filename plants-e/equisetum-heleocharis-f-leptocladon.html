                    <h1>Equisetum heleocharis f. leptocladon</h1>
<p>Equisetum heleocharis f. leptocladon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed water horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are typically green and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
