                    <h1>Erica bergiana var. bergiana</h1>
<p>Erica bergiana var. bergiana, commonly known as the Cape heath or mountain heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in winter and early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
