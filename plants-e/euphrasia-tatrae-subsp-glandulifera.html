<p>Euphrasia tatrae subsp.</p>
<p>glandulifera, commonly known as the Tatra's eyebright, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Tatra Mountains of Central Europe. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of glandular dots on its stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet "glandulifera.". It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.</p>
