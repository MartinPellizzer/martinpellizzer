                    <h1>Epithelantha micromeris var. densispina</h1>
<p>Epithelantha micromeris var. densispina, commonly known as the dense spine cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base, producing small, rounded pads covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attractive. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
