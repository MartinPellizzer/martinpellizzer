                    <h1>Echinocactus obvallatus var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus obvallatus var. spinosior, commonly known as the Mexican golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
