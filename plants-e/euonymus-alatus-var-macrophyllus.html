                    <h1>Euonymus alatus var. macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Euonymus alatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the winged euonymus or the burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is more shrub-like than its closely related species, with larger, broader leaves that contribute to its visual appeal.</p>
