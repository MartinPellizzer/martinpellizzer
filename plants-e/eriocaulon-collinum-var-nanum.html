                    <h1>Eriocaulon collinum var. nanum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon collinum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hill marsh sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in marshy areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for microinvertebrates.</p>
