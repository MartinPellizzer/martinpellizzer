<p>Euphorbia nesomii, commonly known as the Neomii's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many euphorbias.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nesomii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
