                    <h1>Ericoides involucratum</h1>
<p>Ericoides involucratum, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Ericoides involucratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
