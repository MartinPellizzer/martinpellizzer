<p>Eucapnia repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It typically blooms in late summer and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in open tundra.</p>
<p>Eucapnia repanda plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is an important food source for certain herbivorous insects.</p>
