                    <h1>Espeletia funckii</h1>
<p>Espeletia funckii, commonly known as the "Cumbal" or "Andes snow plant," is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the center of its foliage, which blooms in the spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
