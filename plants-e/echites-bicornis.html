<p>Echites bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaves and a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Echites bicornis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
