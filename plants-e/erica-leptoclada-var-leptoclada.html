                    <h1>Erica leptoclada var. leptoclada</h1>
<p>Erica leptoclada var. leptoclada, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
