                    <h1>Euphorbia dracunculoides var. ballii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dracunculoides var. ballii, commonly known as the Ball's Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
