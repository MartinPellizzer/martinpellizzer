<p>Eucnide bartonioides var. edwardsiana, commonly known as Edwards' eucnide, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
