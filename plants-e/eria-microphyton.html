                    <h1>Eria microphyton</h1>
<p>Eria microphyton, commonly known as the small-leaved erythrina, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are woody and often have a climbing habit, making it suitable for trellises or support structures.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats.</p>
