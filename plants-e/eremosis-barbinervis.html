<p>Eremosis barbinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined eremosis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with prominent, parallel veins that give it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Eremosis barbinervis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
