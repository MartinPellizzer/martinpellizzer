                    <h1>Echinocactus ourselianus var. albispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ourselianus var. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined hedgehog cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in thick, white spines that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
