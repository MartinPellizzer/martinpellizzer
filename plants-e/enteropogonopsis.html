<p>Enteropogonopsis, commonly known as the false sand grass, is a genus of grass-like plants belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences with minute flowers. Enteropogonopsis species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>These plants play a minor role in local ecosystems but are of interest to botanists due to their unique adaptations to harsh conditions.</p>
