<p>Ebnerella weingartiana, commonly known as the Weingartian fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing organs located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ebnerella weingartiana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
