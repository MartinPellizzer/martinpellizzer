                    <h1>Epipactis × gerbaudiorum</h1>
<p>Epipactis × gerbaudiorum, commonly known as the Gerbaud's helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it is often found in areas where the parent species overlap geographically.</p>
