                    <h1>Epipactis × capellonensis</h1>
<p>Epipactis × capellonensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems that bear dense, dark green, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Epipactis × capellonensis is primarily found in Europe and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
