                    <h1>Equisetum wallichianum</h1>
<p>Equisetum wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing strobili, or cones, at the top of the stem, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its fossil record dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species.</p>
