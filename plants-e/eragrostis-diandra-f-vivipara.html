                    <h1>Eragrostis diandra f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Eragrostis diandra f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous false panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This unique trait allows it to propagate efficiently in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing forage for livestock and contributing to soil stabilization in degraded habitats.</p>
