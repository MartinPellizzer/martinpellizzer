<p>Eichhornia diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it float on water. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to freshwater environments. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Eichhornia diversifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
