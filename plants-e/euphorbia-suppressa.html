                    <h1>Euphorbia suppressa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia suppressa, commonly known as the Mexican spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and often blue-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia suppressa is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
