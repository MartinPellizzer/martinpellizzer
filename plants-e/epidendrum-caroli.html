                    <h1>Epidendrum caroli</h1>
<p>Epidendrum caroli, commonly known as the Carol's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a greenish or reddish hue. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Epidendrum caroli is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
