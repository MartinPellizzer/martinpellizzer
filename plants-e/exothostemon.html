                    <h1>Exothostemon</h1>
<p>Exothostemon, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with broad, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Exothostemon plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
