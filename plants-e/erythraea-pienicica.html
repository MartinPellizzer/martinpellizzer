                    <h1>Erythraea pienicica</h1>
<p>Erythraea pienicica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Erythraea pienicica is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
