                    <h1>Epischoenus villosus</h1>
<p>Epischoenus villosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in moist habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Epischoenus villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
