                    <h1>Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp. cylindricus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus viridiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
