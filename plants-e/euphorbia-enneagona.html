<p>Euphorbia enneagona, commonly known as the nine-angled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and often spiny stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia enneagona is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
