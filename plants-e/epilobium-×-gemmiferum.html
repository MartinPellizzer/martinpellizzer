<p>Epilobium × gemmiferum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs, and its showy clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Epilobium × gemmiferum reproduces both by seeds and vegetatively through stolons, allowing it to spread effectively in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
