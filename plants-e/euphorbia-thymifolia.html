                    <h1>Euphorbia thymifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
