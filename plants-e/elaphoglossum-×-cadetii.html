                    <h1>Elaphoglossum × cadetii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum × cadetii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile, hybrid species resulting from the cross between Elaphoglossum crossopterygium and Elaphoglossum pumilum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that display a vibrant green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures are underdeveloped, as it is a sterile hybrid, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
