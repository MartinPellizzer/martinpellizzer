                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nimbaense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nimbaense, commonly known as the Nimba holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum nimbaense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
