<p>Euphorbia koerneriana, commonly known as the Koerner's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cylindrical shape called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia koerneriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and resilience.</p>
