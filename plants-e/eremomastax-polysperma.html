<p>Eremomastax polysperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Eremomastax polysperma is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
