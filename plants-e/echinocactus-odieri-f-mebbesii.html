                    <h1>Echinocactus odieri f. mebbesii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus odieri f. mebbesii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rounded stem covered in prominent, radial spines that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This succulent is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
