<p>Euphorbia taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem with a thick, fleshy texture that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, providing some protection from the sun.</p>
<p>Euphorbia taitensis is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
