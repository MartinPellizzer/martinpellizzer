                    <h1>Elaphoglossum plicatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a pleated or folded appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
