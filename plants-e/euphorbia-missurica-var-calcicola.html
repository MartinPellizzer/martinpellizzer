                    <h1>Euphorbia missurica var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia missurica var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly on limestone soils, which contribute to its common name. The plant features a woody stem with a smooth, pale green surface and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic common among many euphorbias.</p>
<p>This species is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
