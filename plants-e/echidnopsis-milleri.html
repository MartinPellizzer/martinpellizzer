The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and a short, robust stem. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from July to September, and relies on specific environmental conditions for successful germination.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
