<p>Epipactis bugacensis subsp.</p>
<p>rhodanensis, commonly known as the Rhodanese helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with brown markings.</p>
<p>The plant is terrestrial, growing in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
