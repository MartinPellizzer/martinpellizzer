                <h1>Effusiella resupinata</h1>
<p>Effusiella resupinata, commonly known as the curled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely appressed leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Effusiella resupinata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
