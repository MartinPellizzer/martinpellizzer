                    <h1>Eaplosia</h1>
<p>Eaplosia, commonly known as the "garden spurge," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and is often used in traditional medicine. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Eaplosia species are found in various regions, primarily in Africa and parts of Asia, and they thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, they are often avoided in horticulture but are studied for their potential medicinal uses.</p>
