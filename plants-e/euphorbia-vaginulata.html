<p>Euphorbia vaginulata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower clusters surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap contains latex, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Euphorbia vaginulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
