                    <h1>Equisetum pallidum</h1>
<p>Equisetum pallidum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its leaves are reduced to small, sterile, scale-like projections. It thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in moist environments such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Equisetum pallidum is an ancient plant species that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.</p>
