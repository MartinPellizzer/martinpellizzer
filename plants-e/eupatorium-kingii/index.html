                            <h1>Eupatorium Kingii</h1>
<p>Eupatorium kingii is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern united states. it is known for its clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. this plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. its common name, "boneset," comes from the way its stems resemble human bones. it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
