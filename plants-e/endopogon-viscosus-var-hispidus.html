                    <h1>Endopogon viscosus var. hispidus</h1>
<p>Endopogon viscosus var. hispidus, commonly known as the sticky hairgrass, is a variant of the sticky hairgrass species native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive sticky, hairy texture on the leaves and stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, viscid surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which contribute to its ecological role in supporting insect and bird life.</p>
