                    <h1>Eriocaulon heterolepis</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon heterolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often grow in dense clusters. This plant typically thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it can tolerate saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology is well adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
