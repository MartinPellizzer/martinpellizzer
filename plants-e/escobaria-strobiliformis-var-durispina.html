                    <h1>Escobaria strobiliformis var. durispina</h1>
<p>Escobaria strobiliformis var. durispina, commonly known as the stonecrops, is a succulent perennial native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped stems covered in dense, waxy, blue-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late spring, adding ornamental value to arid landscapes. It is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to form clumps make it an ideal choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
