                <h1>Euphorbia splendens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia splendens, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red bracts, which are actually modified leaves, in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, its milky sap can be toxic and irritating to the skin, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
