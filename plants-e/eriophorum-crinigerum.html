                    <h1>Eriophorum crinigerum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum crinigerum, commonly known as the silky cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft texture. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing peatland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its habitat.</p>
