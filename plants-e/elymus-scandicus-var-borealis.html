                    <h1>Elymus scandicus var. borealis</h1>
<p>Elymus scandicus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
