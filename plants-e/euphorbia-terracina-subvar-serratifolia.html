                    <h1>Euphorbia terracina subvar. serratifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia terracina subvar. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
