                    <h1>Erysimum polygalodes</h1>
<p>Erysimum polygalodes, commonly known as the yellow wallflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in small, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to species in the genus Polygala, though it is more closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
