<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos var. succulenta, commonly known as the flat-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
