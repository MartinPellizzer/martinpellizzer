                    <h1>Euphorbia anceps</h1>
<p>Euphorbia anceps, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, often ribbed stems that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually small, alternate, and sometimes reduced to spines, especially in mature plants.</p>
<p>Euphorbia anceps is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
