                    <h1>Euphorbia foliosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water, it is well adapted to survive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
