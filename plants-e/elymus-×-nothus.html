                    <h1>Elymus × nothus</h1>
<p>Elymus × nothus, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Elymus repens and Elymus triticoides.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks, and is often found in the northern hemisphere. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Elymus × nothus is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in forage and erosion control.</p>
