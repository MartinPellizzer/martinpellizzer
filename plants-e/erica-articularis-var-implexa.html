                    <h1>Erica articularis var. implexa</h1>
<p>Erica articularis var. implexa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
