                    <h1>Euphorbia purpurata var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia purpurata var. elliptica, commonly known as the Purple-leaf Spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, waxy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, especially under bright light. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flower buds that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
