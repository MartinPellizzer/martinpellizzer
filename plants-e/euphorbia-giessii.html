<p>Euphorbia giessii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia giessii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
