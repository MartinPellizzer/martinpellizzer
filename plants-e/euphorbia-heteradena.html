                    <h1>Euphorbia heteradena</h1>
<p>Euphorbia heteradena, commonly known as the silver euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has spiny, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia heteradena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
