<p>Eriosyce napina subsp.</p>
<p>duripulpa, commonly known as the "Papery Pincushion Cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it a puffy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted coloration. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a shallow root system and thickened stems that store water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry environments.</p>
