                    <h1>Eriopsis sceptrum</h1>
<p>Eriopsis sceptrum, commonly known as the desert star or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Eriopsis sceptrum is adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats.</p>
