<p>Euphorbia hyberna subsp.</p>
<p>canuti, commonly known as the Irish spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
