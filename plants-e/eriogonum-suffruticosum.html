                    <h1>Eriogonum suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum suffruticosum, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and canyon walls. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eriogonum suffruticosum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
