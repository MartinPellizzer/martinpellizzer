                    <h1>Eragrostiella</h1>
<p>Eragrostiella, commonly known as the slender lovegrass, is a genus of grasses native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plants typically have narrow, blade-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Eragrostiella species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in ecological restoration due to their drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
