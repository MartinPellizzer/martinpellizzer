<p>Ernestella involucrata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ernestella involucrata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and sandy habitats.</p>
