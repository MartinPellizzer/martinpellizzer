                    <h1>Euphorbia polycarpa var. genuflexa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polycarpa var. genuflexa, commonly known as the nodding euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, a feature common in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
