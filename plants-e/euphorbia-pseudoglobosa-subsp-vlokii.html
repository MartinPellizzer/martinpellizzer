<p>Euphorbia pseudoglobosa subsp.</p>
<p>vlokii, commonly known as the Vlok's globe thorn, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, contributing to its defensive adaptations.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
