<p>Edraianthus × lakusicii, commonly known as the hybrid edraianthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Edraianthus palmeri and Edraianthus corymbosus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly observed in its native habitat.</p>
