                    <h1>Euphorbia galioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia galioides, commonly known as the marsh spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Euphorbia galioides is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
