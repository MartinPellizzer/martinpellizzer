                    <h1>Ervatamia pubescens var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Ervatamia pubescens var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous ervatamia, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glaberrima is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections.</p>
