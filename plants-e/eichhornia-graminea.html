                    <h1>Eichhornia graminea</h1>
<p>Eichhornia graminea, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy purple flowers, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has a rapid growth rate, often leading to dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and can absorb nutrients from the water, making it both a nuisance and a potential bioindicator.</p>
<p>Eichhornia graminea is widely used in phytoremediation due to its ability to remove pollutants from water.</p>
