                    <h1>Eucalyptus floribunda</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus floribunda, commonly known as the pink eucalypt, is a tall, aromatic tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in thin strips, revealing a pale, fibrous underlayer. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in winter and early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus floribunda is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber and medicinal properties.</p>
