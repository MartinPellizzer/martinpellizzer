                    <h1>Echinocactus radicans</h1>
<p>Echinocactus radicans, commonly known as the sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's spiny exterior provides protection from herbivores and helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
