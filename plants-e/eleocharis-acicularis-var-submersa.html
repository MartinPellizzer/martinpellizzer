                    <h1>Eleocharis acicularis var. submersa</h1>
<p>Eleocharis acicularis var. submersa, commonly known as the submerged spike-rush, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to short, hair-like structures, which help reduce water resistance.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediments.</p>
