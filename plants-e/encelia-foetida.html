<p>Encelia foetida, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and Baja California.</p>

The plant features small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
