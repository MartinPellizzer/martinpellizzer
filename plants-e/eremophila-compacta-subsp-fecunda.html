<p>Eremophila compacta subsp.</p>
<p>fecunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming during the winter and early spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
