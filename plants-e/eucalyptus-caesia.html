                    <h1>Eucalyptus caesia</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus caesia, commonly known as the grey box, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or pale brown in color. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and woodlands across southern Australia.</p>
