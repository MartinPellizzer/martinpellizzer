                    <h1>Euphorbia buhsei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia buhsei, commonly known as the Buhsei spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling should be done with care.</p>
