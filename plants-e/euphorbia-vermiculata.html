                    <h1>Euphorbia vermiculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia vermiculata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
