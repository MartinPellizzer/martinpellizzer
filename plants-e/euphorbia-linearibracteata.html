                    <h1>Euphorbia linearibracteata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia linearibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
