                    <h1>Echinopsis pentlandii var. ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Echinopsis pentlandii var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the White Star Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into a star-like formation, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
