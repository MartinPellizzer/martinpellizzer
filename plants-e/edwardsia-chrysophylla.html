<p>Edwardsia chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique leaf structure and floral morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
