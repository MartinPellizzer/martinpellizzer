                    <h1>Euonymus gracillimus</h1>
<p>Euonymus gracillimus, commonly known as the creeping euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, compact growth and ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for ground cover.</p>
