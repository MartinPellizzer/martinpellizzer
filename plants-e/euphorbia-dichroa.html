                    <h1>Euphorbia dichroa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, contrasting leaf colors, with dark green upper surfaces and pale white or silver undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its toxic sap can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
