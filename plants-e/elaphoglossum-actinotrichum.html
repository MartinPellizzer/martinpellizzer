                    <h1>Elaphoglossum actinotrichum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum actinotrichum, commonly known as the starry holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
