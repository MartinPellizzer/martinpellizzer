<p>Elaeagnus hortensis var. orientalis, commonly known as the silver berry or oriental silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance, and its small, edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic berries later in the season.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
