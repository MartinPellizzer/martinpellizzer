                    <h1>Eritrichium ochotense</h1>
<p>Eritrichium ochotense, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh winters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Eritrichium ochotense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arctic and alpine habitats.</p>
