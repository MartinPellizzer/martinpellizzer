                    <h1>Euphorbia duriuscula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia duriuscula, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia duriuscula is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
