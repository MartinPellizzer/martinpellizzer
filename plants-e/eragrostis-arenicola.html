                    <h1>Eragrostis arenicola</h1>
<p>Eragrostis arenicola, commonly known as sandblain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, reflecting its ability to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eragrostis arenicola is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control.</p>
