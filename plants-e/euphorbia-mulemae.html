                    <h1>Euphorbia mulemae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mulemae, commonly known as the Mulemae spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique globular structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
