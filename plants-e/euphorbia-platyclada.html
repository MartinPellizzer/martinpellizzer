<p>Euphorbia platyclada, commonly known as the flat-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia platyclada is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
