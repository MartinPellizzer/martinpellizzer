<p>Eriocaulon argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
