                    <h1>Echinopus sphaerocephalus</h1>
<p>Echinopus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globular echinopsis, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spherical cluster of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>The spines are modified leaves that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
