                    <h1>Euphorbia bagyrensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia bagyrensis, commonly known as the Gharb Desert euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and a unique flowering structure called a cyathium, which contains both male and female flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions by storing water in its stem and reducing leaf surface area. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Euphorbia bagyrensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh desert environments.</p>
