                    <h1>Euphorbia karoi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia karoi, commonly known as the Karoi spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia karoi is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
