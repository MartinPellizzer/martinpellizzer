                    <h1>Eragrostis pooides var. compacta</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pooides var. compacta, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-green blades that form dense, mat-like growth, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
