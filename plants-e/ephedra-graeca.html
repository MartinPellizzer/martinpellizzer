<p>Ephedra graeca, commonly known as Greek ephedra, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its alkaloid content, it requires careful handling and is regulated in many regions.</p>
