                    <h1>Equisetum brasiliense var. nudum</h1>
<p>Equisetum brasiliense var. nudum, commonly known as the Brazilian horsetail, is a species of fern-like plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its primitive features, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
