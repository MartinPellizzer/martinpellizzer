                    <h1>Ericoides rupicola</h1>
<p>Ericoides rupicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Ericoides rupicola is well-suited to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in its natural habitat.</p>
