<p>Erigeron repens, commonly known as the creeping fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with thin, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Erigeron repens is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
