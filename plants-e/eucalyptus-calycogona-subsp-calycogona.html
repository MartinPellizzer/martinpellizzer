<p>Eucalyptus calycogona subsp.</p>
<p>calycogona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, where it typically grows in open woodlands or shrublands.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish bloom. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought and is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
