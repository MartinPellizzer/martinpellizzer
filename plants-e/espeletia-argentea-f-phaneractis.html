                    <h1>Espeletia argentea f. phaneractis</h1>
<p>Espeletia argentea f. phaneractis, commonly known as the silver tree or white espeletia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This unique morphology helps it thrive in the harsh, cold climates of its natural habitat.</p>
