<p>Eurylepis diosmifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
