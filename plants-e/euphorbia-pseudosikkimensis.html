<p>Euphorbia pseudosikkimensis, commonly known as the Himalayan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
