                            <h1>Elacholoma Prostrata</h1>
<p>Elacholoma prostrata is a rare and delicate moss-like plant found in humid, shaded environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often seen creeping along the forest floor. This plant is known for its small, clustered growth and intricate, branching structure. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity. Studying Elacholoma prostrata offers insights into the resilience of plant life in challenging ecosystems.</p>
