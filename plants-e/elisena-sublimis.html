                    <h1>Elisena sublimis</h1>
<p>Elisena sublimis, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds that resemble lace, with finely divided leaves that create a delicate, airy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Elisena sublimis is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
