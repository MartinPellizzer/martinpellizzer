                    <h1>Eremophila campanulata</h1>
<p>Eremophila campanulata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Eremophila campanulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and landscaping.</p>
