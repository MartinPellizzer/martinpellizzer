                    <h1>Euphorbia rangovalensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rangovalensis, commonly known as the Rangoon euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia rangovalensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to dry environments.</p>
