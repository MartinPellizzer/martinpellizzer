                    <h1>Eulophidium liedenii</h1>
<p>Eulophidium liedenii, commonly known as the Liden's eulophidium, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eulophiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
