                    <h1>Elaphoglossum heteromorphum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often variable in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum heteromorphum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
