                    <h1>Equisetum limosum f. brachycladon</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum f. brachycladon, commonly known as the brachycladon form of the horse tail, is a variant of the common scouring rush.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and vascular tissue.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
