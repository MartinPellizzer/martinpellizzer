                            <h1>Erythrococca Mannii</h1>
<p>Red cocca, scientifically known as Erythrococca mannii, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense rainforests of West Africa. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant red berries, which stand out against the lush green foliage of its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, the plant remains relatively unknown outside of botanical circles and local communities. The plant's unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. However, due to habitat destruction and lack of awareness, Red cocca faces growing threats to its survival.</p>
