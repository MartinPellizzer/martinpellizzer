                    <h1>Elaphoglossum squamocostatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum squamocostatum, commonly known as the scaly-costed holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum squamocostatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
