The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
