                    <h1>Eriosorus stuebelii</h1>
<p>Eriosorus stuebelii, commonly known as the St√ºbel's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called rhizoids, which help in anchoring and absorbing nutrients. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid ecosystems.</p>
