                    <h1>Encephalartos hildebrandtii</h1>
<p>Encephalartos hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural environment.</p>
