<p>Erica compacta, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica compacta is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardiness.</p>
