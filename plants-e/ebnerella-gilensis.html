<p>Ebnerella gilensis, commonly known as the Gil's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, floating growth habit and its ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually pale yellow or greenish, with two lips that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Ebnerella gilensis is noted for its unique adaptations to aquatic life, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
