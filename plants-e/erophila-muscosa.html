                    <h1>Erophila muscosa</h1>
<p>Erophila muscosa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Erophila muscosa is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats.</p>
