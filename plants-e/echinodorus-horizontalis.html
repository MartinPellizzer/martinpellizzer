<p>Echinodorus horizontalis, commonly known as the broadleaf waterweed, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or extend just below it. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Echinodorus horizontalis is popular in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
