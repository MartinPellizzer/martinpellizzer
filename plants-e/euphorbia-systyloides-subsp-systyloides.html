<p>Euphorbia systyloides subsp.</p>
<p>systyloides, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
