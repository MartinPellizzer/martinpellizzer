                    <h1>Ericoides latifolium</h1>
<p>Ericoides latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf heath, is a shrub native to the wetlands and bogs of northern regions.</p>
<p>It features small, evergreen leaves that are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It is often found in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, thriving in the presence of peat and sphagnum moss.</p>
<p>Ericoides latifolium plays a key role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
