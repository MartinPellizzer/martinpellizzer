<p>Equisetum palustre var. szechuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail found in wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
