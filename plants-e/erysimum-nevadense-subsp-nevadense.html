<p>Erysimum nevadense subsp.</p>
<p>nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution within Nevada.</p>
