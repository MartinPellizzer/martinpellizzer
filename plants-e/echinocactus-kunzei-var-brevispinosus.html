                    <h1>Echinocactus kunzei var. brevispinosus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus kunzei var. brevispinosus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
