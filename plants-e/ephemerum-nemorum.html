                    <h1>Ephemerum nemorum</h1>
<p>Ephemerum nemorum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the shaded, moist environments of temperate forests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that appear in early spring and wither by late summer, giving the plant its name. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions with high organic matter in the soil, often found in rich, decaying leaf litter. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its forest habitat, making it a symbol of fleeting beauty in the natural world.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ephemerum nemorum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
