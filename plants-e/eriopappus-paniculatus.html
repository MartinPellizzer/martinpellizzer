<p>Eriopappus paniculatus, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fluffy, white pappus hairs on the seeds aid in wind dispersal, allowing it to spread effectively in its native range.</p>
<p>Eriopappus paniculatus is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
