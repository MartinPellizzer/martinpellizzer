                    <h1>Euphrasia corsica</h1>
<p>Euphrasia corsica, commonly known as the Corsican eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Euphrasia corsica is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the Greek "euphrasis," meaning joy or pleasure, possibly due to its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
