                    <h1>Encelia lagasceiformis</h1>
<p>Encelia lagasceiformis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains latex and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
