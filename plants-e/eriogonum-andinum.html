                    <h1>Eriogonum andinum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum andinum, commonly known as the Andean buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces specialized seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature common in the Eriogonum genus. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
