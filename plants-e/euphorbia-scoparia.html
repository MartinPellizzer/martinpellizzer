                    <h1>Euphorbia scoparia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scoparia, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
