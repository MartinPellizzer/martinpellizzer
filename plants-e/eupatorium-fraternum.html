                    <h1>Eupatorium fraternum</h1>
<p>Eupatorium fraternum, commonly known as swamp eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, swampy areas and has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy white to pinkish flowers bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Eupatorium fraternum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
