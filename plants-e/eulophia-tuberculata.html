<p>Eulophia tuberculata, commonly known as the ridge-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in summer. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Eulophia tuberculata is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
