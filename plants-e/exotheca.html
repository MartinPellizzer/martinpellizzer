                    <h1>Exotheca</h1>
<p>Exotheca, commonly known as the outer layer of a seed coat, is a specialized structure in certain plants, particularly in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is composed primarily of a thick, lignified layer that provides mechanical protection to the developing seed. The exotheca plays a crucial role in preventing desiccation and mechanical damage during seed maturation. It is often associated with the development of the seed's outer integument.</p>
<p>This layer can vary in thickness and composition depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>
