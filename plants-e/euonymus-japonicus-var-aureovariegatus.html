                    <h1>Euonymus japonicus var. aureovariegatus</h1>
<p>Euonymus japonicus var. aureovariegatus, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or golden variegated euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features attractive, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent yellow or white variegation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to reveal seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
<p>This species thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
