                    <h1>Erigeron repens var. psammophilus</h1>
<p>Erigeron repens var. psammophilus, commonly known as sand eryngo, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in white or pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
