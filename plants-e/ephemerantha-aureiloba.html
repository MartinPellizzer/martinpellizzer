<p>Ephemerantha aureiloba, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals that resemble a bell, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It blooms during the late winter to early spring, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ephemerantha aureiloba is considered a conservation concern.</p>
