<p>Epipactis rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, showy inflorescence composed of greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are typically broad and elongated. It is pollinated by specific insects, and its reproductive cycle is closely tied to the local climate and seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
