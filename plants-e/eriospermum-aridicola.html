                    <h1>Eriospermum aridicola</h1>
<p>Eriospermum aridicola, commonly known as the desert eriosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eriospermum aridicola is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
