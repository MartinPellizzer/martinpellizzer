                    <h1>Eriocereus regelii</h1>
<p>Eriocereus regelii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection.</p>
<p>Eriocereus regelii is also known for its ability to form offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate through vegetative means.</p>
