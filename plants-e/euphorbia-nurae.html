                    <h1>Euphorbia nurae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nurae, commonly known as the Nura's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its tissues.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nurae is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
