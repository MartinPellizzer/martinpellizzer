                    <h1>Ephedra pentandra</h1>
<p>Ephedra pentandra, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Ephedra pentandra contains the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is now classified as a controlled substance in many countries due to its potential for abuse and health risks.</p>
