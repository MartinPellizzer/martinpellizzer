                    <h1>Euphorbia exclusa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
