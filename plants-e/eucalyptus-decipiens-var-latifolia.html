                    <h1>Eucalyptus decipiens var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus decipiens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a species native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical E. decipiens. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its growth habit is typically as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are generally evergreen and have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
