                    <h1>Eragrostis crassinervis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis crassinervis, commonly known as broad-veined lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
