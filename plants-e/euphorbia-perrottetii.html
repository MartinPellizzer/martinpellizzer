                    <h1>Euphorbia perrottetii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia perrottetii, commonly known as the Perrottet's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by a crown of bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia perrottetii is well adapted to rocky, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
