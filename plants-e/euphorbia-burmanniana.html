                    <h1>Euphorbia burmanniana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia burmanniana, commonly known as the Burmann's spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia burmanniana is also characterized by its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
