<p>Erica viscaria subsp.</p>
<p>pustulata, commonly known as the sticky heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its profusion of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture and help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>The subspecies pustulata is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger flowers compared to other forms of Erica viscaria.</p>
