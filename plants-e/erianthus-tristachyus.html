<p>Erianthus tristachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or African grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Erianthus tristachyus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
