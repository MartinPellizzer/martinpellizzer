                    <h1>Echinops cephalotes</h1>
<p>Echinops cephalotes, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble small globes, which are a key feature of the genus Echinops. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
