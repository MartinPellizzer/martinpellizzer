<p>Epidendrum sclerocladium, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are typically dark green and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum sclerocladium is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
