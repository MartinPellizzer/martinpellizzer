<p>Echinocactus uncinatus f. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's hedgehog cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, thick pedicels. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The f. wrightii form is a natural variant that exhibits slight differences in size and spination compared to the typical species.</p>
