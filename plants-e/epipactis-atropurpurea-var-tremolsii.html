                    <h1>Epipactis atropurpurea var. tremolsii</h1>
<p>Epipactis atropurpurea var. tremolsii, commonly known as the Purple Helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to brownish-green leaves and its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
