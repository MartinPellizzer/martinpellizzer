                    <h1>Eragrostis potamophila</h1>
<p>Eragrostis potamophila, commonly known as the river grass or watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it retain moisture in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eragrostis potamophila plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
