                    <h1>Echinocereus papillosus var. angusticeps</h1>
<p>Echinocereus papillosus var. angusticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, ribbed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
