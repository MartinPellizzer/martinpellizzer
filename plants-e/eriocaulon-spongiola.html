                    <h1>Eriocaulon spongiola</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon spongiola, commonly known as the sponge moss, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spongy growth of tiny, thread-like leaves that form a mat on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its structure allows it to trap floating particles, contributing to water filtration.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon spongiola plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
