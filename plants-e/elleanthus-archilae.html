                    <h1>Elleanthus archilae</h1>
<p>Elleanthus archilae, commonly known as the golden cupgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Elleanthus archilae is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
