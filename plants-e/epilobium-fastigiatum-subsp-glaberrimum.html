<p>Epilobium fastigiatum subsp.</p>
<p>glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies glaberrimum is distinguished by its nearly hairless stems and leaves, giving it a more streamlined appearance compared to other members of the species.</p>
