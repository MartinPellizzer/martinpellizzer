<p>Euphorbia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow花朵 that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia obliqua is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
