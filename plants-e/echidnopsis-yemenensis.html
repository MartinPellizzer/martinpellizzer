<p>Echidnopsis yemenensis, commonly known as the Yemen stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Yemen.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echidnopsis yemenensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
