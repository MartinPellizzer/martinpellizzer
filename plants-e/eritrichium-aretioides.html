<p>Eritrichium aretioides, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches heights of 10â€“30 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Eritrichium aretioides is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity.</p>
