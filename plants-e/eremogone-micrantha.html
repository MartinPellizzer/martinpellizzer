<p>Eremogone micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with bracts that are mistaken for petals. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremogone micrantha is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
