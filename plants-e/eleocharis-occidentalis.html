                    <h1>Eleocharis occidentalis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis occidentalis, commonly known as western spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis occidentalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
