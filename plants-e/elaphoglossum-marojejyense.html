<p>Elaphoglossum marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy holly fern, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
