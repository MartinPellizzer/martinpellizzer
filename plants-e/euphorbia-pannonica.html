<p>Euphorbia pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
