                    <h1>Euphorbia pachyspina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pachyspina, commonly known as the thickspine euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
