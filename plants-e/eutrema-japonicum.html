<p>Eutrema japonicum, commonly known as Japanese sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
