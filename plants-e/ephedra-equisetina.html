                    <h1>Ephedra equisetina</h1>
<p>Ephedra equisetina, commonly known as the jointfoot ephedra, is a spiny, shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Ephedra equisetina thrives in environments with low rainfall and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it both ecologically significant and historically important.</p>
