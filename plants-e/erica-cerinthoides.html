<p>Erica cerinthoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact form and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Erica cerinthoides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
