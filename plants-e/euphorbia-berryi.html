                    <h1>Euphorbia berryi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia berryi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, containing irritants that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia berryi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
