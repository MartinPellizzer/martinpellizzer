<p>Euphorbia atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia atrorubens is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
