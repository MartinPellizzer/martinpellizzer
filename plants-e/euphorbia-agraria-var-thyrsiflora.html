                    <h1>Euphorbia agraria var. thyrsiflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia agraria var. thyrsiflora, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with numerous short, erect stems covered in small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings.</p>
