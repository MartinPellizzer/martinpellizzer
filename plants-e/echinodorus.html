<p>Echinodorus, commonly known as the Amazon sword, is a genus of aquatic plants native to the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. They are typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Echinodorus species are popular in aquascaping due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Their rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize large areas in water gardens.</p>
