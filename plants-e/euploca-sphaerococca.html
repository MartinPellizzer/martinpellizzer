                    <h1>Euploca sphaerococca</h1>
<p>Euploca sphaerococca, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, cushion-like growth with a bright green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its structure is characterized by closely packed, rounded lobes that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Euploca sphaerococca is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
