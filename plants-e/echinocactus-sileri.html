                    <h1>Echinocactus sileri</h1>
<p>Echinocactus sileri, commonly known as the Siler's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus sileri is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient requirements.</p>
