                            <h1>Earleocassia Confinis</h1>
<p>Earle's cassia, scientifically known as Earleocassia confinis, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This species belongs to the legume family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and feathery foliage. Found primarily in Thailand and Vietnam, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Earle's cassia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
