                    <h1>Epidendrum hexadactylum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum hexadactylum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
