                    <h1>Erisma petiolatum</h1>
<p>Erisma petiolatum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has thin, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Erisma petiolatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for early pollinators.</p>
