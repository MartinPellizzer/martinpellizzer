                    <h1>Eleocharis wolfii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis wolfii, commonly known as the wolf's bulrush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eleocharis wolfii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
