                    <h1>Eriogonum umbellatum var. devestivum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum umbellatum var. devestivum, commonly known as the desert buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other desert flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
