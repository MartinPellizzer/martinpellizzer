<p>Echinocactus vorwerkianus, commonly known as the Vorwerk's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus vorwerkianus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
