                    <h1>Euphorbia engelmannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
