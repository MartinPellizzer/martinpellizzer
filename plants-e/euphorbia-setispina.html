                    <h1>Euphorbia setispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia setispina, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its spiny stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia setispina is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
