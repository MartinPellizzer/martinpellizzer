                    <h1>Empogona</h1>
<p>Empogona, commonly known as the "tropical fig," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their unique syconia, which are specialized inflorescences that house both male and female flowers. Some species produce edible fruits that are consumed by various animals and humans.</p>
<p>However, the genus is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its limited fruit size and specific environmental requirements.</p>
