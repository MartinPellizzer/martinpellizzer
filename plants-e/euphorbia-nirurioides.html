                <h1>Euphorbia nirurioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nirurioides, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nirurioides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
