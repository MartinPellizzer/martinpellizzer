                    <h1>Ellipanthus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Ellipanthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>Ellipanthus tomentosus is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
