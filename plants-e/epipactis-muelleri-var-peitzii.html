<p>Epipactis muelleri var. peitzii, commonly known as the Peitz's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with purple markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
