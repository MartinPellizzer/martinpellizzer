<p>Euphorbia atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, fleshy leaves and a branched, woody stem that develops a reddish-brown color with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation.</p>
