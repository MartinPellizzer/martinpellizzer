                    <h1>Euphorbia hyssopifolia var. pubescenticocca</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hyssopifolia var. pubescenticocca, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
