                    <h1>Erophila oblongata</h1>
<p>Erophila oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Erophila oblongata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
