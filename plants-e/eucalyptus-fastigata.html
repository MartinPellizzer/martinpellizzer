<p>Eucalyptus fastigata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically yellow or red, which develop into woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus fastigata thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, make it valuable for medicinal and industrial uses.</p>
