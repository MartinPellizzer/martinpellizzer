                    <h1>Ebnerella knebeliana</h1>
<p>Ebnerella knebeliana, commonly known as the Knebel's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb water from the soil.</p>
<p>Ebnerella knebeliana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
