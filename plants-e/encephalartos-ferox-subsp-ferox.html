<p>Encephalartos ferox subsp.</p>
<p>ferox, commonly known as the Natal knobbed pine, is a rare and highly ornamental cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of long, arching leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
