                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. paucifolium</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. paucifolium, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are clustered in a structure called a strobilus. It thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its simple, needle-like leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many ancient plant species.</p>
