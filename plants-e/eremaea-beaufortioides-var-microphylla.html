                    <h1>Eremaea beaufortioides var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Eremaea beaufortioides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved eremaea, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, thick, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically between September and December. Its root system is extensive and adapted to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often used in dryland landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental qualities.</p>
