                    <h1>Elaphoglossum pachydermum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum pachydermum, commonly known as the thick-sheath holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a thick, persistent basal sheath. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
