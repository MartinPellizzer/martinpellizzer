                    <h1>Euphorbia gerardiana var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Gerard's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the spurge family. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is native to parts of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xerophytic gardens.</p>
