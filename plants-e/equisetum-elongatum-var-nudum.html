                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. nudum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unbranched, sparsely leafy stems that are covered with small, scale-like structures rather than true leaves. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its lack of true leaves, which distinguishes it from other equisetum species.</p>
