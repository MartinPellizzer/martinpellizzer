                    <h1>Erica subulata</h1>
<p>Erica subulata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica subulata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
