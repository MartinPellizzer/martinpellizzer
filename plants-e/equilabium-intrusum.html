                    <h1>Equilabium intrusum</h1>
<p>Equilabium intrusum, commonly known as the invasive swamp orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in wetland environments. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species, it is considered a significant ecological threat in invaded areas.</p>
