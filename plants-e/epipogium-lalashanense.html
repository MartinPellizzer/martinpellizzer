                    <h1>Epipogium lalashanense</h1>
<p>Epipogium lalashanense, commonly known as the Lalashan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, it thrives in cool, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
