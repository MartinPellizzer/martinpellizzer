<p>Euphorbia tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia tessellata is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
