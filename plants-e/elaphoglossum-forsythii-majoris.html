<p>Elaphoglossum forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, almost velvety appearance.</p>
