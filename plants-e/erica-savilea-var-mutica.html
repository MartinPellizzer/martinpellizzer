                    <h1>Erica savilea var. mutica</h1>
<p>Erica savilea var. mutica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Erica species, sharing similar ecological and horticultural traits.</p>
