                    <h1>Eriocaulon dictyophyllum f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon dictyophyllum f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous marsh plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant reproduction and adaptation to aquatic habitats.</p>
