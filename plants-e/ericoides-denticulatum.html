<p>Ericoides denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed ericoid, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with finely serrated margins, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Ericoides denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
