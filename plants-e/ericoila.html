                    <h1>Ericoila</h1>
<p>Ericoila, commonly known as the marsh heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often in heathlands or bogs. Ericoila species are characterized by their small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are adapted to nutrient-poor environments and often form dense mats or shrubs.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
