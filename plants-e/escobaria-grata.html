                    <h1>Escobaria grata</h1>
<p>Escobaria grata, commonly known as the starry night or silver star cactus, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Escobaria grata is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
