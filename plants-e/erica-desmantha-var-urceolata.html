                    <h1>Erica desmantha var. urceolata</h1>
<p>Erica desmantha var. urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped heath, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a low, bushy mound over time.</p>
