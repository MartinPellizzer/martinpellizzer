                    <h1>Encephalartos altensteinii var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Encephalartos altensteinii var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical stem that bears a single, large, cone-like structure for reproduction. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
