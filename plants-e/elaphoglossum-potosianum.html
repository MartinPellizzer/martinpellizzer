                    <h1>Elaphoglossum potosianum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum potosianum, commonly known as the Potosi holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum potosianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
