<p>Echites andrewsii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, designed to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echites andrewsii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
