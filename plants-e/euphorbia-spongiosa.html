                    <h1>Euphorbia spongiosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, spongy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia spongiosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
