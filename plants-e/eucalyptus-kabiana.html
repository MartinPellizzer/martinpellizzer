                    <h1>Eucalyptus kabiana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus kabiana, commonly known as the Kabianga gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of north-eastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips, and its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically glaucous and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus kabiana is a valuable component of its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land-use impacts.</p>
