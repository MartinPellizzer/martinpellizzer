                            <h1>Enterosora Sectifrons</h1>
<p>Coralroot orchid, scientifically known as Enterosora sectifrons, is a rare and enigmatic species found in specific forest habitats. This plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Its delicate, coral-like roots give it its name, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance and elusive nature. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this fragile orchid from habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
