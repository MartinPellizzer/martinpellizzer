<p>Elymus arenarius var. geniculatus, commonly known as the sand reedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with glumes that are often shorter than the lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and wind.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils, making it an important component of stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
