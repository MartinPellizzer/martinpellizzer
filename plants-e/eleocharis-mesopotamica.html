                    <h1>Eleocharis mesopotamica</h1>
<p>Eleocharis mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian spike-rush, is a grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the Middle East and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis mesopotamica is also a source of food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
