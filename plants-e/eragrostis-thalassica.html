                    <h1>Eragrostis thalassica</h1>
<p>Eragrostis thalassica, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of the United States and other regions with saline soils.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to thrive in salty and well-drained environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eragrostis thalassica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh, saline conditions.</p>
