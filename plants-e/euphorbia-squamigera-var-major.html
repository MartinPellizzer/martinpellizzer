<p>Euphorbia squamigera var. major, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is popular in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
