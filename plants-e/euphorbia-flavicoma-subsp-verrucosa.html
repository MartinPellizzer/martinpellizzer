<p>Euphorbia flavicoma subsp.</p>
<p>verrucosa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it often has a spiny appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its unique morphology and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
