<p>Euphorbia rupicola var. major, commonly known as the giant rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
