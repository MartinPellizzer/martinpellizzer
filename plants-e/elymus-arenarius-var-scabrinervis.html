                    <h1>Elymus arenarius var. scabrinervis</h1>
<p>Elymus arenarius var. scabrinervis, commonly known as the sandgrass or sandrye, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture along the nerves, giving it its specific epithet "scabrinervis.". It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
