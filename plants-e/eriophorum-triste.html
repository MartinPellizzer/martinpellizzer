                    <h1>Eriophorum triste</h1>
<p>Eriophorum triste, commonly known as the sad cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Eriophorum triste plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for acidic, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
