<p>scirpea, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide.</p>

<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
