<p>Ehretia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests or near riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in traditional medicine.</p>
