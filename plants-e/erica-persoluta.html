                    <h1>Erica persoluta</h1>
<p>Erica persoluta, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Erica persoluta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
