                    <h1>Einomeia pentandra</h1>
<p>Einomeia pentandra, commonly known as the five-angled sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
