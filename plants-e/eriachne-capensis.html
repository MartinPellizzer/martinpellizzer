                    <h1>Eriachne capensis</h1>
<p>Eriachne capensis, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
