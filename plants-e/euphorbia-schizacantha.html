<p>Euphorbia schizacantha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
