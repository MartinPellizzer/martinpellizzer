                    <h1>Euodia littoralis</h1>
<p>Euodia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal euodia, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in late winter to early spring, followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Euodia littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
