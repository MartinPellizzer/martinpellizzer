<p>Euphorbia erlangeri, commonly known as the Erler's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
