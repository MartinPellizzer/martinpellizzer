<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Erica gnaphaloides is well adapted to poor, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
