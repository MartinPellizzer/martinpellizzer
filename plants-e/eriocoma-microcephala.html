                    <h1>Eriocoma microcephala</h1>
<p>Eriocoma microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed eriocoma, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, providing insulation and protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Eriocoma microcephala is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
