<p>Elymus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments.</p>
<p>Elymus flexuosus is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
