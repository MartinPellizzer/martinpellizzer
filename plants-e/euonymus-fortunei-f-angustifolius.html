<p>Euonymus fortunei f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a formal appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 that split open to release seeds. It is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate修剪.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is ideal for foundation plantings and topiary.</p>
