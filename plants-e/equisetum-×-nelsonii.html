                    <h1>Equisetum × nelsonii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × nelsonii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum ramosissimum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stems, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments.</p>
