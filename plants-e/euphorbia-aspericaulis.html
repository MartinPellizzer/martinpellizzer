                    <h1>Euphorbia aspericaulis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in rough, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny and sometimes toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
