                    <h1>Euphorbia wightiana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
