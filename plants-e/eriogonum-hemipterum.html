<p>Eriogonum hemipterum, commonly known as the sticky leaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eriogonum hemipterum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems.</p>
