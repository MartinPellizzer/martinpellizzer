                    <h1>Eustegia fraterna</h1>
<p>Eustegia fraterna, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Eustegia fraterna is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in indigenous communities.</p>
