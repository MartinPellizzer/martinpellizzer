                    <h1>Epilobium ligulatum</h1>
<p>Epilobium ligulatum, commonly known as narrowleaf willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and consist of two lips, with the upper lip being narrower than the lower.</p>
<p>Epilobium ligulatum is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators.</p>
