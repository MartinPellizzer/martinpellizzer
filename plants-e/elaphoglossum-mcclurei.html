                    <h1>Elaphoglossum mcclurei</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum mcclurei, commonly known as McClure's holly fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the wet tropical forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a holly leaf. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
