<p>Eurygania phillyreifolia, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Eurygania phillyreifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
