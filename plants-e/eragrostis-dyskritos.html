                    <h1>Eragrostis dyskritos</h1>
<p>Eragrostis dyskritos, commonly known as the dwarf false wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils, and its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies due to its potential for sustainable land management.</p>
