                    <h1>Encopella</h1>
<p>Encopella, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the summer months. Encopella thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
