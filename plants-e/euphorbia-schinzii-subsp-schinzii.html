<p>Euphorbia schinzii subsp.</p>
<p>schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its specialized inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
