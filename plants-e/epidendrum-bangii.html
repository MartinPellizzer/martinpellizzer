<p>Epidendrum bangii, commonly known as the orchid with golden flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are elongated,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
