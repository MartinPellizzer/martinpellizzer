                    <h1>Euphorbia dendroides f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dendroides f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually yellow with a red or orange center.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
