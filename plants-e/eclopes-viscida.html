<p>Eclopes viscida, commonly known as the stickyleaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries containing toxic seeds. Its fibrous stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has also been utilized by indigenous communities for various practical purposes.</p>
