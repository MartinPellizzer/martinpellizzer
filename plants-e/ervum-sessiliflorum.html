<p>Ervum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flowered vetch, is a leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
