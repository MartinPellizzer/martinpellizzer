<p>Elaphoglossum antisanae, commonly known as the Antisanae holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum antisanae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
