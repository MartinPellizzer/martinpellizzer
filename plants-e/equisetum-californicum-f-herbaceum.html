<p>Equisetum californicum f. herbaceum, commonly known as the California horsetail, is a low-growing, herbaceous fern-like plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive stem covered in small, scale-like structures and produces spore-bearing cones at the top. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its slender, jointed stems and whorled leaves give it a primitive, ancient appearance reminiscent of early plant life.</p>
