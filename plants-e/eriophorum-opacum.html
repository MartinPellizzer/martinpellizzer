<p>Eriophorum opacum, commonly known as the woolly cotton-grass, is a herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance, with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Eriophorum opacum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment.</p>
