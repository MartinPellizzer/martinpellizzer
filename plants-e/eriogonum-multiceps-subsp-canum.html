<p>Eriogonum multiceps subsp.</p>
<p>canum, commonly known as the sticky goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a sticky resin, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to golden flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
