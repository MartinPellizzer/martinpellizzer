                    <h1>Ecbolium sphaerospermum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium sphaerospermum, commonly known as the globe-shaped sea bean, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, woody fruits that resemble small, hard-coated seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, allowing it to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Ecbolium sphaerospermum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
