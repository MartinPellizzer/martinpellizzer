                    <h1>Erophila vulgaris</h1>
<p>Erophila vulgaris, commonly known as common watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, submerged leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can dominate aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Erophila vulgaris is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
