                    <h1>Endiandra × monothyra</h1>
<p>Endiandra × monothyra, commonly known as the hybrid tamanu tree, is a cross between Endiandra obliqua and Endiandra monothyra, both native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and for oil extraction.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the genetic diversity within the Endiandra genus.</p>
