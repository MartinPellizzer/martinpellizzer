                    <h1>Eurycaulis calcarifer</h1>
<p>Eurycaulis calcarifer, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eurycaulis calcarifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
