                    <h1>Euphorbia pendula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pendula, commonly known as the weeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures, rather than true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
