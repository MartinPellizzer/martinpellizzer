<p>Eriocaulon moldenkei, commonly known as the dwarf rice sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and flooded soils, where it thrives in consistently moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon moldenkei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
