<p>Eremophila obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Eremophila obovata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
