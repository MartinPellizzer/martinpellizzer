<p>Ericoides piliferum, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. Ericoides piliferum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
