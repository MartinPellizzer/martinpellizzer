<p>Eritrichium thymifolium subsp.</p>
<p>latialatum, commonly known as the alpine thymeleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>The leaves are aromatic, with a distinctive thyme-like scent, and are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
