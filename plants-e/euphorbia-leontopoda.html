                    <h1>Euphorbia leontopoda</h1>
<p>Euphorbia leontopoda, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, branched stems that resemble a lion's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia leontopoda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
