                    <h1>Equisetum palustre var. nanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum palustre var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf field horsetail, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is notable for its retention of primitive vascular structures, including a central stem with a distinct central canal. This variety is typically found in moist, acidic soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of the plant, which are often hidden beneath the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in wetland restoration projects and as a ground cover in shaded, damp gardens.</p>
