                    <h1>Espeletia parvula</h1>
<p>Espeletia parvula, commonly known as the "Cumbal" or "Páramo flower," is a flowering plant native to the páramo ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, showy inflorescences that bloom in the late summer. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil. Its structure includes thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Espeletia parvula plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
