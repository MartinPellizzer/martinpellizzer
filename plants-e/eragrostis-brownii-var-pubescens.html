<p>Eragrostis brownii var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brown lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss.</p>
