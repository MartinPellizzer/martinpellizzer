<p>Ehrharta brevifolia var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive pointed tip, which is characteristic of the varietal form cuspidata. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping.</p>
