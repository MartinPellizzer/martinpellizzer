                    <h1>Eriococcus</h1>
<p>Eriococcus, commonly known as the woolly aphid, is a genus of scale insects belonging to the family Eriococcidae.</p>
<p>These tiny, soft-bodied insects are characterized by their dense, waxy, and often fluffy coating, which gives them their common name. They are typically found on the stems, leaves, and fruits of a wide range of host plants, including ornamentals and fruit trees. Eriococcus species feed on plant sap using their piercing-siphoning mouthparts, which can cause deformation or stunted growth in their host plants.</p>
<p>Their presence is often indicated by the honeydew they secrete, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold.</p>
