                    <h1>Eleocharis multicaulis f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Eleocharis multicaulis f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous spike-rush, is a variant of the spike-rush genus Eleocharis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique vivipary trait, where shoots develop directly from the base of the plant rather than from seeds. This plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its morphology includes slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
