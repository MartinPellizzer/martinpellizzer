<p>Eriosyce clavata subsp.</p>
<p>nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-hairy pear cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with a dense covering of dark, bristly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fleshy, edible fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black spines, which give it its common name.</p>
