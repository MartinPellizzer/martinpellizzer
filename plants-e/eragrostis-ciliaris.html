                    <h1>Eragrostis ciliaris</h1>
<p>Eragrostis ciliaris, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue sheen, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis ciliaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
