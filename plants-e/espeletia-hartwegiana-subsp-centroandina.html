<p>Espeletia hartwegiana subsp.</p>
<p>centroandina, commonly known as the Andean heather, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems, contributing to the unique biodiversity of the region.</p>
