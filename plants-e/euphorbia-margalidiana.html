                    <h1>Euphorbia margalidiana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia margalidiana, commonly known as the Margalidiana Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
