                    <h1>Echinocereus leonensis</h1>
<p>Echinocereus leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
