                    <h1>Eleocharis caribaea var. dispar</h1>
<p>Eleocharis caribaea var. dispar, commonly known as the Caribbean sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and propagation.</p>
