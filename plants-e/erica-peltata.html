                    <h1>Erica peltata</h1>
<p>Erica peltata, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces abundant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Erica peltata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
