<p>Evax pygmaea var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan dwarf pomegranate, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its edible, red-orange fruits that are smaller than typical pomegranates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant.</p>
