                    <h1>Eucalyptus contracta</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus contracta is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
