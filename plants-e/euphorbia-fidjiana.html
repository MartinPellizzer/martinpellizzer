<p>Euphorbia fidjiana, commonly known as the Fijian spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
