                            <h1>Eriophorum × Medium F. Candidum</h1>
<p>Cotton grass, scientifically known as Eriophorum × medium f. candidum, is a unique and delicate plant that thrives in the harsh environments of the Arctic and subarctic regions. Its most striking feature is the fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, giving it its common name. This plant plays an important role in the ecosystems where it grows, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Despite its fragile appearance, cotton grass is remarkably resilient, able to survive in nutrient-poor, cold soils. It is often one of the first plants to colonize barren landscapes, contributing to the gradual process of ecological succession.</p>
