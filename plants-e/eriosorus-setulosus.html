<p>Eriosorus setulosus, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
