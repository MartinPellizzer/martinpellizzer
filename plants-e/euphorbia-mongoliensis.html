<p>Euphorbia mongoliensis, commonly known as the Mongolian spurge, is a succulent plant native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry regions.</p>
