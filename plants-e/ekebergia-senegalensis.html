<p>Ekebergia senegalensis, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, spreading canopy and produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Ekebergia senegalensis is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
