                    <h1>Eurya distichophylla f. asymmetrica</h1>
<p>Eurya distichophylla f. asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric eurya, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, where the leaves exhibit an asymmetrical shape, differing from the typical bilateral symmetry of most Eurya species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elliptical, red-brown berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation, making it a subject of study in plant taxonomy and evolution.</p>
