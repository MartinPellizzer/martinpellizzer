<p>Eriostylos stefaninii, commonly known as the Stefaninii's eriostylos, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, thread-like stamens that are distinctly adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on a delicate balance of light and humidity. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Eriostylos stefaninii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
