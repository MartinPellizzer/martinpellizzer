                    <h1>Euonymus hamiltonianus</h1>
<p>Euonymus hamiltonianus, commonly known as the Hamilton's spurge or the Chinese burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, four-petaled yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red蒴果 that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
