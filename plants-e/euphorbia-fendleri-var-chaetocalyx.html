<p>Euphorbia fendleri var. chaetocalyx, commonly known as the Desert Spear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that are often spiny and adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically small and may be absent in mature plants, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
