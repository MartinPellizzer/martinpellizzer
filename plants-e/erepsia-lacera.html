                    <h1>Erepsia lacera</h1>
<p>Erepsia lacera, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Erepsia lacera is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
