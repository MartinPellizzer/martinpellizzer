                    <h1>Euphorbia poggei var. villosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia poggei var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The leaves are typically small, oval, and also bear a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces striking yellowish-green flower clusters, known as cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbia genus.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
