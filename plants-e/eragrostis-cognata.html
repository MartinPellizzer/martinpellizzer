                    <h1>Eragrostis cognata</h1>
<p>Eragrostis cognata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
