<p>Eleocharis robbinsii, commonly known as Robbins' spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Robbins' spike-rush is an important component of wetland biodiversity and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
