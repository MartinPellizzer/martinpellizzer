                    <h1>Eucalyptus lucasii</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus lucasii, commonly known as the Lucas's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically in winter or early spring.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to low rainfall and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
