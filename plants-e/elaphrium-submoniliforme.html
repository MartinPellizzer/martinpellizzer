                    <h1>Elaphrium submoniliforme</h1>
<p>Elaphrium submoniliforme, commonly known as the bead-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, bead-like morphology.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, wood, and soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is usually pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled upper surface. It lacks a distinct medulla and has a well-developed cortex.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
