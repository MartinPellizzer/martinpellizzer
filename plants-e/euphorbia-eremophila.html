                    <h1>Euphorbia eremophila</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eremophila, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eremophila is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
