                    <h1>Eragrostis rufescens var. laurentiana</h1>
<p>Eragrostis rufescens var. laurentiana, commonly known as Laurentian redgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish tinge in the leaves and culms, which becomes more pronounced during dry periods. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
