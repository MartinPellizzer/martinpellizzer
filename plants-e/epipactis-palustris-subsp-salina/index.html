                            <h1>Epipactis Palustris Subsp. Salina</h1>
<p>Salt marsh helleborine, scientifically known as Epipactis palustris subsp. salina, is a rare and specialized orchid found in coastal salt marshes. This plant thrives in brackish environments where few species can survive due to its unique adaptations to high salinity. Its delicate green leaves and pale yellow-green flowers make it both visually striking and ecologically significant. The salt marsh helleborine plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
