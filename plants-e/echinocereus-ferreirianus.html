                    <h1>Echinocereus ferreirianus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus ferreirianus, commonly known as the Ferreiria's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches near the base. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is also characterized by its dense clusters of white, bristle-like spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
