                    <h1>Epilobium gracile</h1>
<p>Epilobium gracile, commonly known as slender willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy underside. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Epilobium gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
