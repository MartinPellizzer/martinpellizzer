                    <h1>Ephemerantha unicornis</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha unicornis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, waxy white flower that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ephemerantha unicornis is considered endangered and is closely monitored by conservationists.</p>
