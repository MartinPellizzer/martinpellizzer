<p>Epidendrum pavonianum, commonly known as the Pavonian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and typically have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pavonianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
