                    <h1>Epipactis purpurata f. chlorophylla</h1>
<p>Epipactis purpurata f. chlorophylla, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a variant of the helleborine orchid characterized by its reduced pigmentation.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a rhizome and a rosette of basal leaves. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish, lacking the typical purple hues of the species, due to a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll expression. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
