                    <h1>Echinops kulsii</h1>
<p>Echinops kulsii, commonly known as the Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a sea urchin, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by the distinctive, woolly seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its native habitat.</p>
<p>Echinops kulsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
