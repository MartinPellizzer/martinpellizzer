                    <h1>Eurotia ceratoides var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Eurotia ceratoides var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow eurotia, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. The species is adapted to moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in wet conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
