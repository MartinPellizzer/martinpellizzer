                    <h1>Elaphoglossum platyneuron</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum platyneuron, commonly known as the broad-veined hawksbeard, is a fern species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Elaphoglossum platyneuron thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can access the humidity and nutrients it requires for growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats.</p>
