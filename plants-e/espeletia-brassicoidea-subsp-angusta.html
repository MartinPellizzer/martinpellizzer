                    <h1>Espeletia brassicoidea subsp. angusta</h1>
<p>Espeletia brassicoidea subsp.</p>
<p>angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved espeletia, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and p√°ramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, windy environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and its role in local biodiversity.</p>
