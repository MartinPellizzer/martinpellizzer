                    <h1>Echinopsis densispina f. subcarnea</h1>
<p>Echinopsis densispina f. subcarnea, commonly known as the Snowball Cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus with a globular shape.</p>
<p>It features dense, white to pale blue spines that give it a snow-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal.</p>
