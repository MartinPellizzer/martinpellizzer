                    <h1>Euphorbia eggersii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eggersii, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making handling require caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eggersii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
