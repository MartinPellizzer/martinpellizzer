                    <h1>Euphorbia hieronymi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hieronymi is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
