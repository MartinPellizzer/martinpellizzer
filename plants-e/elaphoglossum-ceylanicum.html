<p>Elaphoglossum ceylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Sri Lanka, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or clustered. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
