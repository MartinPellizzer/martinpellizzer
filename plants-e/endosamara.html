                    <h1>Endosamara</h1>
<p>Endosamara, commonly known as the "false nut" or "endospermous samara," is a type of dry, indehiscent fruit found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It consists of a single seed enclosed within a thin, winged or membranous pericarp. The endosperm, which is the nutritive tissue surrounding the seed, is fully developed and often provides nourishment to the embryo. This fruit type is characteristic of some members of the Rutaceae and Malvaceae families.</p>
<p>Endosamaras typically disperse by wind due to their lightweight structure and often have a papery or leathery texture.</p>
