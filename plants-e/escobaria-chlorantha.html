<p>Escobaria chlorantha, commonly known as the green chalkscale, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Escobaria chlorantha is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
