<p>Eragrostis habrantha, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>Eragrostis habrantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
