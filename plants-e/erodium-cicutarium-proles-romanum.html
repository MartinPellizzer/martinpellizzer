<p>Erodium cicutarium proles romanum, commonly known as the Roman chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pink or violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become a weed in cultivated settings.</p>
