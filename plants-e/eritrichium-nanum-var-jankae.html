<p>Eritrichium nanum var. jankae, commonly known as the Janka's dwarf alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
