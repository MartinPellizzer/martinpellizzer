<p>Eragrostis cumingii var. rindjaniensis, commonly known as the Rindjani grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
