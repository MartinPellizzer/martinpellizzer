                    <h1>Euphorbia cooperi var. cooperi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cooperi var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
