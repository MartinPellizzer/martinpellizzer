                    <h1>Eriocaulon minusculum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon minusculum, commonly known as the minute bulbous sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon minusculum is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these ecosystems.</p>
