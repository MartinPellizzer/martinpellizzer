<p>Eleocharis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a small, grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
