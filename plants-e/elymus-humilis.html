                    <h1>Elymus humilis</h1>
<p>Elymus humilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Elymus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
