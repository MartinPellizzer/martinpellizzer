                    <h1>Elytrigia × tesquicola</h1>
<p>Elytrigia × tesquicola, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile, diploid hybrid species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia bulbosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often green to bluish-green in color. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle with spikelets that are usually two-ranked.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability.</p>
