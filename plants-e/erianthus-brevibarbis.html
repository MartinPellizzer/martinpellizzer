<p>Erianthus brevibarbis, commonly known as the short-barbed bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southern and central regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purplish flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Erianthus brevibarbis is also used in some regions for forage and as a component in native plant gardens.</p>
