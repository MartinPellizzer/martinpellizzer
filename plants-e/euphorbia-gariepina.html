<p>Euphorbia gariepina, commonly known as the Gariep spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
