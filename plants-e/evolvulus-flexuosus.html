                    <h1>Evolvulus flexuosus</h1>
<p>Evolvulus flexuosus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed.</p>
