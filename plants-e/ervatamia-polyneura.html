                    <h1>Ervatamia polyneura</h1>
<p>Ervatamia polyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eragrostis, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
