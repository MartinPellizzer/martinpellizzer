                    <h1>Erysimum linifolium</h1>
<p>Erysimum linifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species. The plant relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
