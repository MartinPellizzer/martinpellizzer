                    <h1>Euphorbia genistoides var. puberula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia genistoides var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems covered in a fine, fuzzy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
