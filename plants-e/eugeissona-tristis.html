                    <h1>Eugeissona tristis</h1>
<p>Eugeissona tristis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pale green or white flowers are unique and often appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Eugeissona tristis is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
