<p>Echinopsis gemmata, commonly known as the "Candelabra Cactus," is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candlestick, which are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinopsis gemmata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature.</p>
