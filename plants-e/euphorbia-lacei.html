                    <h1>Euphorbia lacei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lacei, commonly known as the lace spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to overwatering, it requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.</p>
