                    <h1>Endomelas</h1>
<p>Endomelas, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish flower. Endomelas thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in the canopy of pine forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
