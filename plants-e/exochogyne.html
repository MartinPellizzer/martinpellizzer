                    <h1>Exochogyne</h1>
<p>Exochogyne, commonly known as the "scented cycad," is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves and a tall, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Exochogyne species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered endangered.</p>
