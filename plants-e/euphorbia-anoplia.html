<p>Euphorbia anoplia, commonly known as the smooth spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia anoplia is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
