<p>Eremogone capillaris, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces pale pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Eremogone capillaris is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes.</p>
