<p>Euphorbia pulverulenta, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a grayish, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
