                    <h1>Echinochloa setosum</h1>
<p>Echinochloa setosum, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and produces spikes of small, pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense stands, often competing with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
