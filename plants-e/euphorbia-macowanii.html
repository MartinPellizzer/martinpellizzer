                    <h1>Euphorbia macowanii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
