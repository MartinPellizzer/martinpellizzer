The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is native to South America and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, aquatic environments.</p>
