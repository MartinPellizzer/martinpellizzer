                    <h1>Eragrostis major var. subbiloba</h1>
<p>Eragrostis major var. subbiloba, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
