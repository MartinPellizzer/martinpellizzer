                    <h1>Encyclia cyperifolia</h1>
<p>Encyclia cyperifolia, commonly known as the Cyperus-leaved orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves that resemble those of the sedge plant Cyperus, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Encyclia cyperifolia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
