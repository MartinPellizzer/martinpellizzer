                    <h1>Edraianthus graminifolius f. baldaccii</h1>
<p>Edraianthus graminifolius f. baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii's grass-leaved edraianthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like, narrow leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after addition to specialized horticultural collections.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
