<p>Euphorbia petrophila var. armena, commonly known as Armenian rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens.</p>
