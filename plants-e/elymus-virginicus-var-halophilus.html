<p>Elymus virginicus var. halophilus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important stabilizer of coastal dunes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a key component of salt marsh and tidal flat ecosystems.</p>
