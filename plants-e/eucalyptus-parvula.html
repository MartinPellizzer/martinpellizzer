<p>Eucalyptus parvula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus parvula thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climates of its native region.</p>
