<p>Ephedra peduncularis, commonly known as the creeping ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Ephedra peduncularis is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of dry, well-drained habitats and contributes to the ecological diversity of desert ecosystems.</p>
