                    <h1>Erythrina latifolia</h1>
<p>Erythrina latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which consist of three to five broad, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the spring or early summer. Its seeds are encased in a three-lobed, woody pod that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Erythrina latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye.</p>
