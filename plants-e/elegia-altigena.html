                    <h1>Elegia altigena</h1>
<p>Elegia altigena, commonly known as the giant water flea, is a freshwater zooplankton, not a plant, and therefore does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Cyclopoida and is characterized by its small, translucent body and long antennae. This organism plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as both a predator and prey. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is an important indicator species for water quality.</p>
