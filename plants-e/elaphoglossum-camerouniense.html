                    <h1>Elaphoglossum camerouniense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum camerouniense, commonly known as the Cameroon holly fern, is a species of fern native to Cameroon and neighboring regions in Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and temperate conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum camerouniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
