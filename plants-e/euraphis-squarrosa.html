                    <h1>Euraphis squarrosa</h1>
<p>Euraphis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose aphid, is a small, soft-bodied insect that belongs to the family Aphididae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found on various species of plants, particularly those in the legume family, where it feeds on sap. The plant's botanical relevance lies in its role as a host for this aphid species, which can cause damage through excessive feeding and the transmission of plant viruses. Euraphis squarrosa is often found on the underside of leaves, where it congregates in large numbers.</p>
<p>Its presence can lead to leaf curling, yellowing, and reduced plant growth, making it a significant concern for agricultural and horticultural practices.</p>
