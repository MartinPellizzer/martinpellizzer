                    <h1>Erianthus sorghum</h1>
<p>Erianthus sorghum, commonly known as giant sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and tall, branching stalks that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces dense panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically golden or brown in color. It is adapted to thrive in hot, arid environments and is often found in savannas and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is used for forage, erosion control, and sometimes as a bioenergy crop.</p>
