                    <h1>Euphorbia quadrata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia quadrata, commonly known as the quadrangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, four-sided stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
