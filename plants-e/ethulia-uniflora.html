<p>Ethulia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, solitary bloom that typically appears in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and grows from a rhizome, which helps it survive in its moist, shaded habitat. Ethulia uniflora is known for its unique floral structure, with a highly specialized orchid lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
