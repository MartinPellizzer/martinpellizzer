The plant produces tiny, four-petaled yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, lantern-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ground cover due to its dense growth habit.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate shade.</p>
