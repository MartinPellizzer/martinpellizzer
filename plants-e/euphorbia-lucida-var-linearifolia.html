                    <h1>Euphorbia lucida var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lucida var. linearifolia, commonly known as the bright euphorbia or linear-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
