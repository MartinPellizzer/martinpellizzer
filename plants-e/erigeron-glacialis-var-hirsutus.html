<p>Erigeron glacialis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy hoary fleabane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, contributing to the ecological diversity of alpine habitats.</p>
