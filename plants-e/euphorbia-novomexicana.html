                    <h1>Euphorbia novomexicana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia novomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
