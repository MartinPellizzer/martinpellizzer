<p>Elymus elymoides subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolius, commonly known as the shortleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Elymus elymoides.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat.</p>
