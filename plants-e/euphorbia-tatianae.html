<p>Euphorbia tatianae, commonly known as the Tatiana's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking yellow-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tatianae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
