                    <h1>Equisetum pratense f. praecox</h1>
<p>Equisetum pratense f. praecox, commonly known as early field horsetail, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
