                    <h1>Euphrasia phragmostoma</h1>
<p>Euphrasia phragmostoma, commonly known as the marsh toadflax, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots often form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
