                    <h1>Euphorbia humboldtii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia humboldtii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy resin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers surrounded by vibrant yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia humboldtii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
