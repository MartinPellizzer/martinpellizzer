                    <h1>Elaphoglossum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum × intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate holly fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Elaphoglossum crenulatum and Elaphoglossum tamariscinum.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized fern with delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a finely divided structure. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait in the Elaphoglossum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.</p>
