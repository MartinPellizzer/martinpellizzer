<p>Eremophila glabra subsp.</p>
<p>chlorella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies chlorella is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other subspecies of Eremophila glabra.</p>
