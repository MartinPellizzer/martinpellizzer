                    <h1>Euphorbia immersa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia immersa, commonly known as the submerged spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
