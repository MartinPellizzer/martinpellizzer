<p>Espeletia grandiflora var. cayetana, commonly known as the Cayetana heather, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is part of the Bromeliaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
