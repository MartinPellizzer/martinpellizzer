<p>Eucalyptus macrorhyncha var. brachycorys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a variant of the broad-leaf mallees native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in open forests and woodlands, often in sandy or loamy soils. It produces woody, branching stems that can form dense thickets, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, white bloom.</p>
<p>This variant is well adapted to dry conditions and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
