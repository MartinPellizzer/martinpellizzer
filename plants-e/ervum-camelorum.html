                    <h1>Ervum camelorum</h1>
<p>Ervum camelorum, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Ervum camelorum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in regions where it grows naturally.</p>
