<p>Erythrodes llanganetensis, commonly known as the Llanganete redwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
