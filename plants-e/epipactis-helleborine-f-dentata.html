                    <h1>Epipactis helleborine f. dentata</h1>
<p>Epipactis helleborine f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a distinctive, showy inflorescence with yellow-green flowers that have a prominent, spurred lip. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It reproduces through seeds and also spreads vegetatively via rhizomes.</p>
<p>The toothed helleborine is an epipetalous orchid, meaning its flowers are attached to the leaves rather than the stem.</p>
