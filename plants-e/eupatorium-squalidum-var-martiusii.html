<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet, disturbed habitats such as ditches and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable botanical feature, likely serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
