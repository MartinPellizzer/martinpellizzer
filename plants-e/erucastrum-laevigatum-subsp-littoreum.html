<p>Erucastrum laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>littoreum, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in salt marshes and dune environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, slender pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
