<p>Echinacanthus lyallianus, commonly known as the Lyall's spurge, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its toxic sap, which contains irritants that can cause skin reactions in humans.</p>
