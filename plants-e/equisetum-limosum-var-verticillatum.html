                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. verticillatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. verticillatum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, ridged stems and spore-producing cones.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as marshes and stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its stems are rich in silica, giving them a rigid, almost glassy texture. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often limited by environmental conditions like water availability.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its whorled arrangement of branches, which sets it apart from other equisetum species.</p>
