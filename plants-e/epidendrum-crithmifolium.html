                    <h1>Epidendrum crithmifolium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum crithmifolium, commonly known as the sea anemone orchid, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southern United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble sea anemones, with a central column surrounded by numerous petals. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum crithmifolium is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its root system.</p>
