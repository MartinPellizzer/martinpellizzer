<p>Eleocharis tuerckheimii, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, grass-like plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish from other rush species.
