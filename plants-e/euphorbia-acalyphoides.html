<p>Euphorbia acalyphoides, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
