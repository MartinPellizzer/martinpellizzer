                    <h1>Euphorbia canaliculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia canaliculata, commonly known as the channel-veined spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia canaliculata is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
