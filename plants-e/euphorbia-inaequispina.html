<p>Euphorbia inaequispina, commonly known as the unequal-spined euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems and spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
