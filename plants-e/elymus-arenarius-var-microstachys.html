                    <h1>Elymus arenarius var. microstachys</h1>
<p>Elymus arenarius var. microstachys, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
