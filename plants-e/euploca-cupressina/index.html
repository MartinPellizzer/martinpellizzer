                            <h1>Euploca Cupressina</h1>
<p>Euploca cupressina is a unique and resilient plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found along the shores where the ocean meets the land. This species is known for its compact, shrub-like appearance and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Despite its modest size, Euploca cupressina plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
