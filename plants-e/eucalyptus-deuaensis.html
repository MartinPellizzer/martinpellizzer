<p>Eucalyptus deuaensis, commonly known as the Deua River gum, is a small to medium-sized eucalyptus native to the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands. The tree has smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, globular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and adaptation to its specific habitat.</p>
