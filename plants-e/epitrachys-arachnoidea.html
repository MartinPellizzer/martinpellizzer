                    <h1>Epitrachys arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Epitrachys arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Epitrachys arachnoidea is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinator biodiversity.</p>
