                    <h1>Epiphyton</h1>
<p>Epiphyton, commonly known as the air plant, is a type of epiphytic plant that grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris accumulating on their host. Epiphyton species typically have dense, compact foliage that helps retain water.</p>
<p>They are popular as houseplants due to their low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
