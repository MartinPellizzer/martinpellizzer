The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts.</p>
