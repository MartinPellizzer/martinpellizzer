                    <h1>Echinopsilon lanatus</h1>
<p>Echinopsilon lanatus, commonly known as the hairy echinops, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruiting bodies that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Echinopsilon lanatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental spiny fruit.</p>
