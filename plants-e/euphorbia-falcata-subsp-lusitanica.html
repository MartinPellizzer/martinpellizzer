<p>Euphorbia falcata subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
