<p>Euphorbia hereroensis, commonly known as the Herero spurge, is a succulent shrub native to Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and latex contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hereroensis is often found in rocky habitats and is well-suited to withstand drought conditions.</p>
