<p>Euphorbia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia johnstonii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
