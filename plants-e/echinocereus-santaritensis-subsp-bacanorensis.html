<p>Echinocereus santaritensis subsp.</p>
<p>bacanorensis, commonly known as the Santa Rita hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus with a compact, rounded stem that often branches at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, thick pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
