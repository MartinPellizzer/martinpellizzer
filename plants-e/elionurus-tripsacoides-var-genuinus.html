The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
