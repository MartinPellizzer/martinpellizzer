                    <h1>Equisetum × litorale var. comosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum × litorale var. comosum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Equisetum litorale and Equisetum comosum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, coastal environments, such as salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant features a slender, jointed stem covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and frequent tidal exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
