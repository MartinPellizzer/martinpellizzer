                    <h1>Espeletia argentea</h1>
<p>Espeletia argentea, commonly known as the silver bush, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Espeletia argentea is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems.</p>
