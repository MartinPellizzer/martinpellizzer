<p>Ephippiandra capuronii, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green or yellowish in color. Ephippiandra capuronii is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
