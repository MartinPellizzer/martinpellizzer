                    <h1>Euphorbia erinacea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia erinacea, commonly known as the "Cotton Spurge," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, cotton-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia erinacea is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
