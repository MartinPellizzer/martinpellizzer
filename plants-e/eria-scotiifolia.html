<p>Eria scotiifolia, commonly known as the Scottish fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Eria scotiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
