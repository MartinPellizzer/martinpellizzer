                <h1>Ericoila nivalis</h1>
<p>Ericoila nivalis, commonly known as the snow heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Ericoila nivalis plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
