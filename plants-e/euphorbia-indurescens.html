                    <h1>Euphorbia indurescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia indurescens, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Euphorbia indurescens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
