                    <h1>Euphorbia podagrica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia podagrica, commonly known as the blistering euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains irritants that can cause skin blisters, making it potentially hazardous to handle.</p>
<p>Euphorbia podagrica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
