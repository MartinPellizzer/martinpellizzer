<p>Eleogenus ochreatus, commonly known as the golden tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and needle-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eleogenus ochreatus is also noted for its role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
