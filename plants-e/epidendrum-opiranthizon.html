                    <h1>Epidendrum opiranthizon</h1>
<p>Epidendrum opiranthizon, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
