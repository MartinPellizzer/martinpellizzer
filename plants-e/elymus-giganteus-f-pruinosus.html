                    <h1>Elymus giganteus f. pruinosus</h1>
<p>Elymus giganteus f. pruinosus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a variant of the tall wheatgrass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of a fine, waxy coating on the leaves. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat.</p>
