                    <h1>Euphorbia atropurpurea f. lutea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia atropurpurea f. lutea, commonly known as the orange sunset euphorbia, is a compact, ornamental plant characterized by its striking, fleshy, spiny stems and vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
