<p>Euphorbia colorata, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and yellowish-green leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
