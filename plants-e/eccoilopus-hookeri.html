<p>Eccoilopus hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, star-shaped growth pattern. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found on rocks or tree trunks in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying bryophyte ecology.</p>
