                    <h1>Escobaria vivipara</h1>
<p>Escobaria vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing sandmat, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of live young plants on the stems, a unique viviparous reproductive strategy. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Escobaria vivipara thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
