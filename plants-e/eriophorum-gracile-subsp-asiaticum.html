<p>Eriophorum gracile subsp.</p>
<p>asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton balls, which are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
