                    <h1>Eriosyce sandillon var. mollesensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce sandillon var. mollesensis, commonly known as the soft sandhill cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
