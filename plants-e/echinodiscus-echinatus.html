                    <h1>Echinodiscus echinatus</h1>
<p>Echinodiscus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny disc coral, is a species of calcareous algae that forms a bushy, branching structure.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny, calcified plates that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in shallow marine environments, where it attaches to rocky substrates. The algae's calcified skeleton provides structural support and protection against herbivory.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to reef formation and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
