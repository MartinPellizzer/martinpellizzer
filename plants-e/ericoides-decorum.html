                    <h1>Ericoides decorum</h1>
<p>Ericoides decorum, commonly known as the ornamental heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Ericoides decorum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
