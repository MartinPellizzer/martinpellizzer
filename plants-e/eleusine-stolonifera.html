<p>Eleusine stolonifera, commonly known as匍匐牛筋草, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
