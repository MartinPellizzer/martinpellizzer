                    <h1>Eschweilera platycarpa</h1>
<p>Eschweilera platycarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat destruction and overharvesting.</p>
