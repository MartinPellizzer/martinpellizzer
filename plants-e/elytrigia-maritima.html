                    <h1>Elytrigia maritima</h1>
<p>Elytrigia maritima, commonly known as sea wheat, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion in maritime environments.</p>
