                    <h1>Eatonia pensylvanica var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Eatonia pensylvanica var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender eatonia, is a rare variant of the eatonia plant native to specific regions of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
