<p>Elaphoglossum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium.</p>
