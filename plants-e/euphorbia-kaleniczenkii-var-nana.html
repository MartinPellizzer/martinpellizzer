                    <h1>Euphorbia kaleniczenkii var. nana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia kaleniczenkii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf kaleniczenkii spurge, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
