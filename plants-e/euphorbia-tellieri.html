                    <h1>Euphorbia tellieri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tellieri, commonly known as the Mexican milkplant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the genus Euphorbia. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
