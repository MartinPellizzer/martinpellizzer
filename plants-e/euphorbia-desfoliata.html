<p>Euphorbia desfoliata, commonly known as the leafless spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant typically has no leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is surrounded by colorful bracts.</p>
<p>Euphorbia desfoliata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
