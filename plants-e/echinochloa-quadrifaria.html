<p>Echinochloa quadrifaria, commonly known as four-leaf grass, is an annual grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated areas.</p>
