<p>Echinocactus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stem that is ribbed and covered with prominent, white to light green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from the areoles along the stem. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
