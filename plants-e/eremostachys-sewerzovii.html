<p>Eremostachys sewerzovii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
