                    <h1>Euchaetis abietina</h1>
<p>Euchaetis abietina, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to tree bark, particularly on white pines. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found in forested areas where air quality is relatively clean.</p>
<p>This lichen serves as an indicator of environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
