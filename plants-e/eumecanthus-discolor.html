                    <h1>Eumecanthus discolor</h1>
<p>Eumecanthus discolor, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Eumecanthus discolor is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
