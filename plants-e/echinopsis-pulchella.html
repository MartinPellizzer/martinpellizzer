<p>Echinopsis pulchella, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bats and insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinopsis pulchella is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
