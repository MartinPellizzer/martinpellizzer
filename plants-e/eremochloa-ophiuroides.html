<p>Eremochloa ophiuroides, commonly known as the golden beard grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf-like coverage.</p>
