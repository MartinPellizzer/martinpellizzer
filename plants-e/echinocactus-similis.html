<p>Echinocactus similis, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Echinocactus similis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
