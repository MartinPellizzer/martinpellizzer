<p>Euphorbia macdonaldii var. potentillina, commonly known as the Macdonald's spurge, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
