                    <h1>Elytrigia dshungarica</h1>
<p>Elytrigia dshungarica, commonly known as Siberian grass or Dzungarian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Elytrigia dshungarica is often found in alpine meadows and steppe ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
