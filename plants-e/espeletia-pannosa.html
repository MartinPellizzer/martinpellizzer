                    <h1>Espeletia pannosa</h1>
<p>Espeletia pannosa, commonly known as the "Páramo espeletia," is a striking plant native to the páramo ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Its rosette structure and silver-green leaves are features that aid in reducing water loss and protecting against intense UV radiation.</p>
<p>Espeletia pannosa plays an important ecological role in these unique habitats, supporting local biodiversity and contributing to soil stability.</p>
