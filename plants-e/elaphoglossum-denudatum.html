<p>Elaphoglossum denudatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum denudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
