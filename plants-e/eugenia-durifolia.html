<p>Eugenia durifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved eugenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.

It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>Eugenia durifolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
