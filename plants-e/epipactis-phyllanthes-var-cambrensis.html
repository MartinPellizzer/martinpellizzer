                    <h1>Epipactis phyllanthes var. cambrensis</h1>
<p>Epipactis phyllanthes var. cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant is perennial, producing upright flowering stems that bear several flowers arranged in a loose spiral. It has a complex life cycle involving mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This orchid is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>
