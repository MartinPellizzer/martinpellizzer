                    <h1>Euphorbia herteri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia herteri, commonly known as the Herter's spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, branching stems covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
