                    <h1>Euphorbia barnhartii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia barnhartii, commonly known as the Barnhart's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical, branching stem covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further adapting to its drought-prone habitat.</p>
<p>Euphorbia barnhartii is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
