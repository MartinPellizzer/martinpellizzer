<p>Eleusine sparsa, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential use in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
