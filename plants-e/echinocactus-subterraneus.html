                    <h1>Echinocactus subterraneus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus subterraneus, commonly known as the Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus with a distinctive spiny, globular shape that resembles a pincushion. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus subterraneus produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiky structure.</p>
