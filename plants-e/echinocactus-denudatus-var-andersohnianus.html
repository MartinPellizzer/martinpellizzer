<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. andersohnianus, commonly known as the Andersohn's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels at the stem tips. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
