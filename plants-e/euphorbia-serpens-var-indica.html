                    <h1>Euphorbia serpens var. indica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serpens var. indica, commonly known as the Indian Spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, low-growing habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that often form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower clusters, and has tiny, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
