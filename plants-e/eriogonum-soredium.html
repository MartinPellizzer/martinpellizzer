                    <h1>Eriogonum soredium</h1>
<p>Eriogonum soredium, commonly known as the stickyleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces tiny, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriogonum soredium is an important component of sagebrush steppe ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
