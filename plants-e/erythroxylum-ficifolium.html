                    <h1>Erythroxylum ficifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum ficifolium, commonly known as the fig-leaf coca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elliptical, woody fruits. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like cocaine.</p>
<p>However, it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes and traditional use in some indigenous cultures.</p>
