<p>Erica globiceps subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and vibrant floral display.</p>
