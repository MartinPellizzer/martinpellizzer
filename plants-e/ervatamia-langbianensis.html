<p>Ervatamia langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian ervatamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood.</p>
