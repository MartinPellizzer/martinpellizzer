<p>Equisetum ramosissimum subsp.</p>
<p>paleaceum, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. It belongs to the family Equisetaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground level. Its leaves are reduced to small, needle-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its primitive morphology and its ability to persist in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
