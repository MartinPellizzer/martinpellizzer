<p>Euphorbia glareosa subsp.</p>
<p>stepposa, commonly known as the steppe euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
