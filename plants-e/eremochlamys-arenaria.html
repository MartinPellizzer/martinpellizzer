<p>Eremochlamys arenaria, commonly known as the sand cholla, is a small, spineless cactus native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its desert environment. Its structure is compact, with a short, branching stem that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremochlamys arenaria plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
