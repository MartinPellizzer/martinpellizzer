                    <h1>Elymus cinereus var. pubens</h1>
<p>Elymus cinereus var. pubens, commonly known as the silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to silver in color. Its leaves are characterized by their silvery-blue sheen, which is due to the dense covering of short, soft hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
