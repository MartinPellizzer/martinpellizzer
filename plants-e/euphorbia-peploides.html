<p>Euphorbia peploides, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia peploides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
