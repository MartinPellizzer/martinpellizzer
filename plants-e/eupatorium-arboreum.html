<p>Eupatorium arboreum, commonly known as boneset, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Boneset is typically found in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the brittle, jointed appearance of its stem, which resembles bones.</p>
