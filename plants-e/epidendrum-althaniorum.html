                    <h1>Epidendrum althaniorum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum althaniorum, commonly known as the Althan's Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Epidendrum althaniorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
