<p>Eucalyptus flocktoniae subsp.</p>
<p>hebes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically cream to pale yellow in color, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
