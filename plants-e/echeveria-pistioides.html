<p>Echeveria pistioides, commonly known as the Mexican snowball, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray to silver in color, with a powdery coating that gives them a frosty appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
