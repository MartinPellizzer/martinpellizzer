                    <h1>Euphorbia acanthodes</h1>
<p>Euphorbia acanthodes, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
