<p>Euphorbia leucantha, commonly known as the White Spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
