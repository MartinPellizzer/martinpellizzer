<p>Eucalyptus wimmerensis subsp.</p>
<p>pallida, commonly known as the Wimmera mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically yellow or yellow-green, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>
