<p>Epipogium generalis, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but are instead specialized shoots called "candles.". It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
