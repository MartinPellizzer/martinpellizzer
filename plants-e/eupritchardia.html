<p>Eupritchardia, commonly known as the golden bamboo or golden reed, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and clusters of golden-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Eupritchardia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking foliage and floral display.</p>
