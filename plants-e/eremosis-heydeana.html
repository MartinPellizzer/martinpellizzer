                    <h1>Eremosis heydeana</h1>
<p>Eremosis heydeana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, hairy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremosis heydeana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
