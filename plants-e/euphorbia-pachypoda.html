                    <h1>Euphorbia pachypoda</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pachypoda, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia pachypoda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
