                    <h1>Elytrigia sosnowskyi</h1>
<p>Elytrigia sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's fairygrass, is a rare and diminutive grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extremely short stature, typically growing no taller than 2 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
