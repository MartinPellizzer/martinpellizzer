<p>Evrardianthe poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that display a mix of colors, often including shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Evrardianthe poilanei is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
