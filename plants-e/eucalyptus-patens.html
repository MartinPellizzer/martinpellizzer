                    <h1>Eucalyptus patens</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus patens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stringy gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin layers, and the wood is light and soft, making it suitable for certain industrial uses.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
