<p>Equisetum hyemale subsp.</p>
<p>trachyodon, commonly known as the rough horsetail, is a perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is known for its spore-producing cones, which are typically found at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its stems are covered in rough, tuberculate nodes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its primitive features and its role in ecological succession in disturbed habitats.</p>
