                    <h1>Ectasis follicularis</h1>
<p>Ectasis follicularis, commonly known as the follicular balloon plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>The plant features elongated, inflated follicles that resemble balloons, which are typically filled with air and serve as a means of seed dispersal. These follicles are often brightly colored, aiding in attracting pollinators and facilitating reproduction. The botanical structure of the plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its morphology is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation in specialized ecosystems.</p>
