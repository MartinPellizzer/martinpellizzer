<p>Escallonia rubra var. rubra, commonly known as the red escallonia, is a flowering shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and other pollinators.</p>
