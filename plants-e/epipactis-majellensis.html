The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
