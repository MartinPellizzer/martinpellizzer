<p>Euphorbia cartaginiensis, commonly known as the Cartagena spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia cartaginiensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
