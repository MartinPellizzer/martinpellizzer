<p>Eragrostis macrochlamys, commonly known as the large-chalmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
