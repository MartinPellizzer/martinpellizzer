                    <h1>Echinocactus haageanus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus haageanus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, segmented leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short, branched stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscapes.</p>
