<p>Euphorbia semiverticillata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, green leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
