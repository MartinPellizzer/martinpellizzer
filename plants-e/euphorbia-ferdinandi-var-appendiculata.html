                    <h1>Euphorbia ferdinandi var. appendiculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ferdinandi var. appendiculata, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
