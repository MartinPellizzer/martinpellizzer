                    <h1>Euphorbia exumensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia exumensis, commonly known as the Exum's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Euphorbia exumensis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
