                            <h1>Euphrasia Stricta Var. Curta</h1>
<p>Euphrasia stricta var. curta is a unique plant species known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. This variant of Euphrasia, commonly called the short-stemmed eyebright, thrives in specific habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, upright stems that distinguish it from other members of the genus. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is also considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
