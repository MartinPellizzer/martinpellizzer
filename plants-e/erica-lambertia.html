                    <h1>Erica lambertia</h1>
<p>Erica lambertia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with high salt exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are needle-like, gray-green in color, and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erica lambertia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
