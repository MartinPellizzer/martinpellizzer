                    <h1>Epipogium makinoanum</h1>
<p>Epipogium makinoanum, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, typically growing on decaying wood or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
