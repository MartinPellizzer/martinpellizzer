<p>Echinocereus melanacanthus, commonly known as the black spined hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dark, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
