                    <h1>Euphorbia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a spiny, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as "tunas.". Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fruticosa is also known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
