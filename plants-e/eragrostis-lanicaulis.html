<p>Eragrostis lanicaulis, commonly known as the woolly bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Eragrostis lanicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
