                    <h1>Epilobium densum var. nesophilum</h1>
<p>Epilobium densum var. nesophilum, commonly known as the alpine willow or woolly willow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its cool, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in alpine ecosystems.</p>
