                    <h1>Eucalyptus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus glaucescens, commonly known as the silver ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish or greyish hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
