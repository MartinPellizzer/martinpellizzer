                    <h1>Eragrostis pallida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pallida, commonly known as pale wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale-green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Pale wheatgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
