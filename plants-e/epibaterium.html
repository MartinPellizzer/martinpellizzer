                    <h1>Epibaterium</h1>
<p>Epibaterium, commonly known as the epiphytic liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the surfaces of trees, rocks, or other substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Epibaterium reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to grow on various surfaces make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions.</p>
