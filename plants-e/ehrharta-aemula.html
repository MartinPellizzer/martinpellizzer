                    <h1>Ehrharta aemula</h1>
<p>Ehrharta aemula, commonly known as common Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 2â€“10 cm long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is highly adaptable, often forming dense mats that can dominate various habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions outside its native range.</p>
