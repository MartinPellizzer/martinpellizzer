                    <h1>Echinocactus asterias var. nudus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus asterias var. nudus, commonly known as the naked star cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and prominent, radial spines that give it a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky form. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
