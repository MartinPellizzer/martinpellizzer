                    <h1>Epipogium africanus</h1>
<p>Epipogium africanus, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fleshy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
