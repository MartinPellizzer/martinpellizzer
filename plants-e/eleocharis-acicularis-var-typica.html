                    <h1>Eleocharis acicularis var. typica</h1>
<p>Eleocharis acicularis var. typica, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
