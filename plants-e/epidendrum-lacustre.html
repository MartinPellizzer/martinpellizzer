                    <h1>Epidendrum lacustre</h1>
<p>Epidendrum lacustre, commonly known as the Lake Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lacustre thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
