<p>Euphorbia incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
