                    <h1>Erione</h1>
<p>Erione, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and leathery, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its wood, Erione is also considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>
