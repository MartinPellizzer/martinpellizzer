                    <h1>Erodium fumarioides</h1>
<p>Erodium fumarioides, commonly known as the sticky weed or false smokeplant, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers that resemble those of the genus Fumaria, hence its common name. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it can become a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
