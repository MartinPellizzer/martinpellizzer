                    <h1>Euphorbia nortoniana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nortoniana, commonly known as Norton's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically narrow and may be covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia nortoniana is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
