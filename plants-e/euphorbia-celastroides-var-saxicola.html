                    <h1>Euphorbia celastroides var. saxicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia celastroides var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its modified flowers, often surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
