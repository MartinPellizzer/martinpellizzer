The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and protected by conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of scientific interest and botanical study.</p>
