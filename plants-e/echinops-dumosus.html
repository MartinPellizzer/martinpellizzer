                    <h1>Echinops dumosus</h1>
<p>Echinops dumosus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and spiny, globe-shaped seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Echinops dumosus is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
