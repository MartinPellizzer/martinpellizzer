                    <h1>Epipactis purpurata f. rosea</h1>
<p>Epipactis purpurata f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
