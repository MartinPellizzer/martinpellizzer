<p>Ebenus reesei var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sandworts, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick, succulent leaves that store water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
