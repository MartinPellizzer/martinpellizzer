                    <h1>Euphorbia celerieri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia celerieri, commonly known as the fast-growing spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features succulent, often ribbed stems that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Euphorbia celerieri is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
