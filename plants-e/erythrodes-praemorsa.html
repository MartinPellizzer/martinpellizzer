                    <h1>Erythrodes praemorsa</h1>
<p>Erythrodes praemorsa, commonly known as the red-leafed death orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its pale green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Erythrodes praemorsa is considered endangered.</p>
