                    <h1>Eragrostis pritzelii</h1>
<p>Eragrostis pritzelii, commonly known as the Pritzel's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend toward the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Eragrostis pritzelii is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
