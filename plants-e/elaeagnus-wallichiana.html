<p>Elaeagnus wallichiana, commonly known as the silver leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus wallichiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation efforts.</p>
