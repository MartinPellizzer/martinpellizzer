<p>Eleusine geminata, commonly known as false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. Its seeds are similar in appearance to rice grains, which can lead to confusion in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Eleusine geminata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated fields.</p>
