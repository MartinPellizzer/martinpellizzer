<p>Equisetum pratense var. sphacelatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central, hollow stem that is often green or yellow-green in color. This variety is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its stems often have a distinct, segmented appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is considered a living fossil.</p>
