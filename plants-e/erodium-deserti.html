                    <h1>Erodium deserti</h1>
<p>Erodium deserti, commonly known as the desert bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Erodium deserti produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal across sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert insects.</p>
