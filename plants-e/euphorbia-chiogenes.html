<p>Euphorbia chiogenes, commonly known as the desert spurflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its milky sap, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, can be irritating to the skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chiogenes plays a role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
