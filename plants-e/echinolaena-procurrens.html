                    <h1>Echinolaena procurrens</h1>
<p>Echinolaena procurrens, commonly known as the prostrate burrgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Echinolaena procurrens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
