                    <h1>Eryngium leavenworthii f. albinum</h1>
<p>Eryngium leavenworthii f. albinum, commonly known as the white thistle, is a rare variant of the common eryngium found in the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. The plant has spiny, grass-like leaves and produces spherical flower heads that are often mistaken for small, white balls. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
