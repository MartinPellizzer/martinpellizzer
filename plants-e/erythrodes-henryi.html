                    <h1>Erythrodes henryi</h1>
<p>Erythrodes henryi, commonly known as the Henry's red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a delicate, intricate floral structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky substrates or among dense forest canopies. Its flowers are short-lived but highly attractive to specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Erythrodes henryi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
