<p>Euphorbia microclada, commonly known as the dwarf African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to store water, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
