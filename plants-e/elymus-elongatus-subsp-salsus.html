<p>Elymus elongatus subsp.</p>
<p>salsus, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in degraded or saline habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize challenging soils.</p>
