                    <h1>Euphorbia beharensis var. adpressifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia beharensis var. adpressifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
