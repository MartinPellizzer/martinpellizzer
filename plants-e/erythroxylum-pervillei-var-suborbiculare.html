                    <h1>Erythroxylum pervillei var. suborbiculare</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum pervillei var. suborbiculare, commonly known as the Peruvian coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elliptical, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cocaine, which has made it both botanically and economically significant.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly rounded leaf base, setting it apart from other Erythroxylum species.</p>
