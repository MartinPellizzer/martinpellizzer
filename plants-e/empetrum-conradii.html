                    <h1>Empetrum conradii</h1>
<p>Empetrum conradii, commonly known as the Greenland willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Empetrum conradii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various arctic wildlife species.</p>
