<p>Elaphoglossum cladotrichium, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in short, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky habitats, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
