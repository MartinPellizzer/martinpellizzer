<p>Echeveria navicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf echeveria, is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves. The leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This succulent is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
