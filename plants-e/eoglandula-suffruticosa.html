                    <h1>Eoglandula suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Eoglandula suffruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and succulent leaves make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Eoglandula suffruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
