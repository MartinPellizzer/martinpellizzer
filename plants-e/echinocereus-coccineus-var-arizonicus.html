                    <h1>Echinocereus coccineus var. arizonicus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus coccineus var. arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical E. coccineus by its more robust growth habit and slightly different spination.</p>
