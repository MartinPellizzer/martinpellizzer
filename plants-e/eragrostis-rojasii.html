<p>Eragrostis rojasii, commonly known as the Rosas' lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is adapted to low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis rojasii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
