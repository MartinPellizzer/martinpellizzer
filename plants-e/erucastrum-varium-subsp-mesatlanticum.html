<p>Erucastrum varium subsp.</p>
<p>mesatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
