<p>Entandrophragma macrocarpum, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its large, elongated fruits that contain a single seed. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its strength, durability, and fine grain, making it a valuable resource in timber trade.</p>
<p>However, due to overexploitation, it is now listed as a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
