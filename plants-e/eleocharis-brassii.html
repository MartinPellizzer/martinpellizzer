                    <h1>Eleocharis brassii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis brassii, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments across much of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets.</p>
<p>Eleocharis brassii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
