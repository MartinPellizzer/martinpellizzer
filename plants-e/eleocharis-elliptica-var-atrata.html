                    <h1>Eleocharis elliptica var. atrata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis elliptica var. atrata, commonly known as black needlegrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of silica. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spiky inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms.</p>
