<p>Eriophyllum ambiguum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the Coast Goldfields, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
