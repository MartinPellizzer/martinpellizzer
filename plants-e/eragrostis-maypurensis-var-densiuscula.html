                    <h1>Eragrostis maypurensis var. densiuscula</h1>
<p>Eragrostis maypurensis var. densiuscula, commonly known as the dense dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has fibrous roots that aid in soil stabilization and water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to ecological diversity and provides habitat for small fauna.</p>
