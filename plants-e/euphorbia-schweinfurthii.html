<p>Euphorbia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiky appearance with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested or contacted with skin.</p>
<p>Euphorbia schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
