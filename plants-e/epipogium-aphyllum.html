<p>Epipogium aphyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, relying entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, ephemeral flowers that are often short-lived and difficult to observe. It is typically found growing on the roots of trees in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
