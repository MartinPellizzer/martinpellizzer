                    <h1>Euonymus michoacanensis</h1>
<p>Euonymus michoacanensis, commonly known as the Michoacan euonymus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cercidiphyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Michoacan, where it grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, often with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
