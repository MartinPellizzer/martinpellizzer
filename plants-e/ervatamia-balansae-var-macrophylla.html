<p>Ervatamia balansae var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved ervatamia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length, often with a waxy, silver-green appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
