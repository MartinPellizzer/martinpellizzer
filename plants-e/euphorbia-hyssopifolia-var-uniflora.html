<p>Euphorbia hyssopifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
