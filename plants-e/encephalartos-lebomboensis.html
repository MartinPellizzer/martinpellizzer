                    <h1>Encephalartos lebomboensis</h1>
<p>Encephalartos lebomboensis, commonly known as the Lebombo cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in subtropical regions with a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
