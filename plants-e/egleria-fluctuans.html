                    <h1>Egleria fluctuans</h1>
<p>Egleria fluctuans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary vegetative organs.</p>
<p>Egleria fluctuans is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladders to trap and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
