<p>Eriachne pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered eriachne, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in spike-like clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
