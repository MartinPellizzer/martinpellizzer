                    <h1>Echinocactus cornifer var. longisetus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus cornifer var. longisetus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
