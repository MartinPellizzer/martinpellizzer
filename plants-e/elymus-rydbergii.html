<p>Elymus rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
