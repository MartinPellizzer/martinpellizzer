                    <h1>Euphorbia fischeriana var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fischeriana var. pilosa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
