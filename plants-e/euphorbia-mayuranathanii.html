<p>Euphorbia mayuranathanii, commonly known as the Mayuranathan's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
