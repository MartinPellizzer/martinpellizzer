<p>Epidendrum punctiferum, commonly known as the spotted epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with distinctive red or purple spots on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum punctiferum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
