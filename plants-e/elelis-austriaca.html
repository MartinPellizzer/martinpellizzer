                    <h1>Elelis austriaca</h1>
<p>Elelis austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian elelis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinct flowering pattern that aids in its pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Elelis austriaca is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
