                    <h1>Eucalyptus platypus</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus platypus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallees, is a species of eucalyptus native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that range in color from white to yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Eucalyptus platypus is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and woodland communities.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly eucalyptol, make it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes.</p>
