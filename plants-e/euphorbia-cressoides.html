<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring a short, thick stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family.

<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
