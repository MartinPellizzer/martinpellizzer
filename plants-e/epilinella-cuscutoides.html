                    <h1>Epilinella cuscutoides</h1>
<p>Epilinella cuscutoides, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
