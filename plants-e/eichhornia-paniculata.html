                    <h1>Eichhornia paniculata</h1>
<p>Eichhornia paniculata, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has vibrant purple flowers and broad, waxy leaves that allow it to absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, leading to dense growth in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, which can impact water quality.</p>
<p>However, its invasive nature often causes ecological imbalances in non-native habitats.</p>
