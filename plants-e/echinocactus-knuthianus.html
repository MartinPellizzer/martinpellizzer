The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus knuthianus is well adapted to desert environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
