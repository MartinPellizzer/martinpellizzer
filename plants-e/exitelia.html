                    <h1>Exitelia</h1>
<p>Exitelia, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae, comprises grass-like species that are often found in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants typically exhibit narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Many species within the genus are adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Some species are also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their aesthetic appeal.</p>
