                    <h1>Erythroxylum × peyritschii</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum × peyritschii, commonly known as the hybrid copal tree, is a species resulting from the cross between Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum aromatum.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are often used in traditional practices and have a history of being cultivated for their stimulant properties.</p>
<p>However, it is not as widely recognized or studied as its parent species.</p>
