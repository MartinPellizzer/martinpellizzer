<p>Erodium bipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a small annual herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, hairy stems and trifoliate or pinnate leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium bipinnatum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
