<p>Erigeron alpinus var. uniflorus is a striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is known for its delicate white flowers and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variant of the common cinquefoil is distinguished by its single flower per stem, a unique feature that sets it apart from other members of the species. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and harsh climates highlights its resilience and adaptability. Despite its small size, it holds significant ecological value and is cherished by gardeners for its beauty and ease of care.</p>
