                    <h1>Euphorbia barbicarina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia barbicarina, commonly known as the barbed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
