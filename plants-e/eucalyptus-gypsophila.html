                    <h1>Eucalyptus gypsophila</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus gypsophila, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, globular clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
