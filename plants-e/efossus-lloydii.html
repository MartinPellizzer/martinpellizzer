                    <h1>Efossus lloydii</h1>
<p>Efossus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions in the dim forest understory. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its rhizomes creeping along the forest floor and producing small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Efossus lloydii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it remains a subject of ongoing botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
