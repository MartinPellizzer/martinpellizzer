                    <h1>Elytrigia</h1>
<p>Elytrigia, commonly known as basket grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often tufted growth habit and are typically found in temperate regions. Elytrigia species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soils and thrive in disturbed environments. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Elytrigia triandra, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
