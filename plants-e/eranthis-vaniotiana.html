                    <h1>Eranthis vaniotiana</h1>
<p>Eranthis vaniotiana, commonly known as the Vaniotian gloryflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of the flower. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a velvety texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eranthis vaniotiana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
