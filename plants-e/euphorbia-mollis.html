                    <h1>Euphorbia mollis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
