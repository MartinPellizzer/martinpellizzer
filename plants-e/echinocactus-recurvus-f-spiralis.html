                    <h1>Echinocactus recurvus f. spiralis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus recurvus f. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the echinocactus genus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly spiraled, cylindrical stems that give it a distinctive, almost spiral-like appearance. The plant features spiny, ribbed structures that help it retain water in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles along the stem.</p>
<p>This form is a fasciation mutation, resulting in the unusual spiral growth pattern that sets it apart from the standard echinocactus species.</p>
