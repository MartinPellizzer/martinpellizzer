<p>Elsholtzia tristis, commonly known as the gray germander, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has slender, hairy stems that are often branched. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of whitish to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Elsholtzia tristis is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils or along dry streambeds.</p>
