                    <h1>Epilobium saximontanum</h1>
<p>Epilobium saximontanum, commonly known as the alpine willow or mountain willow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Epilobium saximontanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
