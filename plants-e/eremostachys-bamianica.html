<p>Eremostachys bamianica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Eremostachys bamianica is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
