                    <h1>Echinocactus ebenacanthus var. minor</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ebenacanthus var. minor, commonly known as the small hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water once established. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
