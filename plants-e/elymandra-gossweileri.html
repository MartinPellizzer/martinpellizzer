<p>Elymandra gossweileri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows from a bulbous rootstock, which allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Elymandra gossweileri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
