<p>Elaphoglossum stipitatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually shorter and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum stipitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
