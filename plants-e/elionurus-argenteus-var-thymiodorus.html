<p>Elionurus argenteus var. thymiodorus, commonly known as the silver-haired grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
