<p>Euphorbia uncinata, commonly known as the hooked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical, segmented stem covered in a layer of white, waxy sap that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a slight curl at the tip, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia uncinata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for arid environments.</p>
