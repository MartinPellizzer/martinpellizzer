                    <h1>Euphorbia fendleri var. dissimilis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fendleri var. dissimilis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
