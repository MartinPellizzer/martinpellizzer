                    <h1>Euphorbia rafinesquei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, water-storing leaves and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among the Euphorbia genus.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
