                            <h1>Ephedra Equisetiformis Subsp. Distachya</h1>
<p>Ephedra equisetiformis subsp. distachya is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Ephedraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is known for its unique morphology and medicinal properties. This subspecies is characterized by its branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it survive in harsh environments. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its stimulant effects. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered threatened and requires conservation efforts.</p>
