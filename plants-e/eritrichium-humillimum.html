<p>Eritrichium humillimum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster, and it is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season.</p>
<p>Eritrichium humillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
