                    <h1>Euonymus carrierei</h1>
<p>Euonymus carrierei, commonly known as the Carrière's spindle-tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive orange-red蒴果 (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Euonymus carrierei is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
