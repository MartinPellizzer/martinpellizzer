                            <h1>Epipactis Gracilis</h1>
<p>Epipactis gracilis, also known as the slender helleborine, is a delicate orchid species that thrives in shaded, moist environments. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers make it easily distinguishable from other orchid species. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Epipactis gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
