<p>Eriachne aristidea, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eriachne aristidea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
