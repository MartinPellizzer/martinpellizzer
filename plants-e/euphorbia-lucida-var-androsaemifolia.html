                    <h1>Euphorbia lucida var. androsaemifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lucida var. androsaemifolia, commonly known as the Androsaemifolia euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
