<p>Espeletia corymbosa var. foliosa, commonly known as the "white tree of the Andes," is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing insulation against the cold and harsh conditions of its environment. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in white or pale purple hues.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
