                    <h1>Encheiridion</h1>
<p>Encheiridion, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that bloom on long, sturdy stalks rising from water. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The botanical name Encheiridion is derived from the Greek word meaning "handbook," reflecting its historical use in medicinal and spiritual practices.</p>
