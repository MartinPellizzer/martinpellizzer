                    <h1>Eriosyce ceratistes var. zorillaensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce ceratistes var. zorillaensis, commonly known as the Zorilla's cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with ribbed structure, which helps it store water in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants for reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
