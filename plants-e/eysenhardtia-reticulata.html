<p>Eysenhardtia reticulata, commonly known as the lacebark tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals a network of fissures, giving it a rugged, lace-like appearance. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Eysenhardtia reticulata is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats.</p>
