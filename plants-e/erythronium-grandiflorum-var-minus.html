                    <h1>Erythronium grandiflorum var. minus</h1>
<p>Erythronium grandiflorum var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered dog's tooth violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth and produces showy, nodding flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
