                    <h1>Encephalartos transvenosus</h1>
<p>Encephalartos transvenosus, commonly known as the Transvenosus cycad, is a rare and endangered species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
