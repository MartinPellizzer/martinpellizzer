<p>Elaphoglossum splendens, commonly known as the shining holly fern, is a delicate perennial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a striking metallic sheen, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum splendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady garden settings.</p>
