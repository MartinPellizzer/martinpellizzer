<p>Echinopsis scoparia, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often have a bluish-gray color and are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Echinopsis scoparia is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
