                    <h1>Echinocactus peeblesianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus peeblesianus, commonly known as the Peebles hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in dry gardens.</p>
