                    <h1>Erythraea viridensis</h1>
<p>Erythraea viridensis, commonly known as the green erythraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
