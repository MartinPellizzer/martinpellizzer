                    <h1>Euphorbia peplus var. minima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia peplus var. minima, commonly known as the smallleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is considered a potential irritant to skin and should be handled with care.</p>
