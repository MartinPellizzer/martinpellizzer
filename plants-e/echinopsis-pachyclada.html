                    <h1>Echinopsis pachyclada</h1>
<p>Echinopsis pachyclada, commonly known as the "Pachyclada Cactus," is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinopsis pachyclada is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
