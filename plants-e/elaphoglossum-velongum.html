<p>Elaphoglossum velongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum velongum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
