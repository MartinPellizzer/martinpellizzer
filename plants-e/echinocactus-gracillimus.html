                    <h1>Echinocactus gracillimus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus gracillimus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spineless, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
