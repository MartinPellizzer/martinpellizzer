<p>Epidendrum pachypodum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed epidendron, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are typically broad and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum pachypodum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
