                    <h1>Euphorbia dulcis var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dulcis var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
