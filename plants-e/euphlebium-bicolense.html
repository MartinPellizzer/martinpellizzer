<p>Euphlebium bicolense, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Euphlebiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that display a striking two-color pattern, typically with a dark green base and a lighter green or yellowish tip. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are essential for its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Euphlebium bicolense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
