<p>Espeletia schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's heath, is a plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its rosette growth form, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Espeletia schultzii is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in the unique ecosystems of the Andean highlands.</p>
