                    <h1>Equisetum kansanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum kansanum, commonly known as the northern horsehair fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a distinct, hollow stem covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant species.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its evolutionary history as one of the oldest groups of land plants.</p>
