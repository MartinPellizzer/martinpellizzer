<p>Eragrostis lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
