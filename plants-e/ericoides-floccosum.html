                    <h1>Ericoides floccosum</h1>
<p>Ericoides floccosum, commonly known as the fluffcap moss, is a small, cushion-like moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of abundant, silky white rhizoids that give it a distinctive, cotton-like texture. The plant forms compact mats and is often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Ericoides floccosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
