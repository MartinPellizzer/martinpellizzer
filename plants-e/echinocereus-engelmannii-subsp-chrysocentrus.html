<p>Echinocereus engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>chrysocentrus, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a spine-tipped cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching structure composed of cylindrical stems covered in clusters of bright yellow, tuberculate spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne on the areoles. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The golden cholla is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
