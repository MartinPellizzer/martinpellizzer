<p>Epipactis leptochila var. cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in woodland ecosystems.</p>
