<p>Ephedra ciliata var. polylepis, commonly known as the Tibetan ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and contains alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which have medicinal uses. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its harvesting is now regulated due to conservation concerns.</p>
