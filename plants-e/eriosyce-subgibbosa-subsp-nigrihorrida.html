<p>Eriosyce subgibbosa subsp.</p>
<p>nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-bristled rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, dark spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
