<p>Echinochloa oryzetorum, commonly known as rice grass, is a species of annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found growing in wetland areas, rice paddies, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
