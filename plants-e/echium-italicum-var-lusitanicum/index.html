                            <h1>Echium Italicum Var. Lusitanicum</h1>
<p>Italian thistle, scientifically known as Echium italicum var. lusitanicum, is a striking plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and vibrant purple-blue flowers that bloom in late spring and summer. Often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, this plant has adapted to thrive in harsh environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
