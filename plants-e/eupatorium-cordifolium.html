                    <h1>Eupatorium cordifolium</h1>
<p>Eupatorium cordifolium, commonly known as heart-leaved thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.

It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its heart-shaped foliage, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
