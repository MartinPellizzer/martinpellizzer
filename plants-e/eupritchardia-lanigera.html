                    <h1>Eupritchardia lanigera</h1>
<p>Eupritchardia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly eupritchardia, is a rare and unique plant native to the high elevations of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a member of the Liliaceae family, which includes lilies and other related plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Eupritchardia lanigera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
