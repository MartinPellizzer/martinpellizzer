                            <h1>Enkleia Andamanica</h1>
<p>Andaman glorybower, scientifically known as Enkleia andamanica, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. This species belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants worldwide. Its vivid, showy flowers often display a combination of red, yellow, and orange hues, making it a standout in its native habitat. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in dense coastal forests and disturbed sites. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Enkleia andamanica is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>
