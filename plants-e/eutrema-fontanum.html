                    <h1>Eutrema fontanum</h1>
<p>Eutrema fontanum, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Eutrema fontanum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
