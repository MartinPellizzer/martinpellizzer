                    <h1>Epidendrum virescens</h1>
<p>Epidendrum virescens, commonly known as the green epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum virescens is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
