                    <h1>Epipactis longifolia var. longibracteata</h1>
<p>Epipactis longifolia var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves and a dense cluster of greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often along stream banks or in damp soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the species is notable for its complex pollination mechanism involving specific insects.</p>
<p>The variety longibracteata is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the base of the flower spike, setting it apart from other forms of Epipactis longifolia.</p>
