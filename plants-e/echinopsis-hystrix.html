                    <h1>Echinopsis hystrix</h1>
<p>Echinopsis hystrix, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure and ability to survive with minimal water make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
