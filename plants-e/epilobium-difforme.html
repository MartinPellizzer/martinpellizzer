                    <h1>Epilobium difforme</h1>
<p>Epilobium difforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and borne in dense spikes, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Epilobium difforme is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
