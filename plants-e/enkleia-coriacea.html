                    <h1>Enkleia coriacea</h1>
<p>Enkleia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved enkleia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a distinctive white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Enkleia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in botanical studies, particularly in the study of xerophytic adaptations.</p>
