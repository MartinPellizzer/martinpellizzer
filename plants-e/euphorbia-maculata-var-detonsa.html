                    <h1>Euphorbia maculata var. detonsa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia maculata var. detonsa, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its milky latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling the plant requires caution.</p>
