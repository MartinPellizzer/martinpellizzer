                    <h1>Euphorbia subpeltata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia subpeltata, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical, branching stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Euphorbia subpeltata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
