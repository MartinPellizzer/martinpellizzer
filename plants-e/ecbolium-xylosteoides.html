                    <h1>Ecbolium xylosteoides</h1>
<p>Ecbolium xylosteoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and deciduous leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous, bark-like stems are used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in drought conditions makes it an important species for ecological stability in desert ecosystems.</p>
