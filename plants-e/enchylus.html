                    <h1>Enchylus</h1>
<p>Enchylus, commonly known as the white spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Enchylus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>They are often used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity requires caution in handling and use.</p>
