<p>Epiblastus sciadanthus, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining potting mix and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
