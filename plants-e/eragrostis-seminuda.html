<p>Eragrostis seminuda, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, showcasing a clump-forming habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis seminuda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
