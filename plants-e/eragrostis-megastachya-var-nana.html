                    <h1>Eragrostis megastachya var. nana</h1>
<p>Eragrostis megastachya var. nana, commonly known as dwarf false wheatgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
