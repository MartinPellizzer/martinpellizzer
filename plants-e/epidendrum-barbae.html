<p>Epidendrum barbae, commonly known as the beard orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a contrasting lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Epidendrum barbae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
