                    <h1>Elatine triandra var. genuina</h1>
<p>Elatine triandra var. genuina, commonly known as the slender waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has whorled leaves that are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Elatine triandra var. genuina is often found in moist soil or floating on the water surface, and it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
