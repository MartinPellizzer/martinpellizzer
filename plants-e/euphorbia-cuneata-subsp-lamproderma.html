<p>Euphorbia cuneata subsp.</p>
<p>lamproderma, commonly known as the red-stemmed spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care, and it is often used in xeriscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
