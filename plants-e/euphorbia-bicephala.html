<p>Euphorbia bicephala, commonly known as the two-headed spurge, is a striking succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive appearance with two prominent, spiky heads that resemble a split plant, giving it its common name. The plant has fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
