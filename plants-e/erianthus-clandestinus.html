<p>Erianthus clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Erianthus clandestinus is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a source of forage for wildlife.</p>
