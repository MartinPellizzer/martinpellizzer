                    <h1>Elvasia brevipedicellata</h1>
<p>Elvasia brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed elvasia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Elvasiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth form and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or pale yellow in color. It is primarily found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky outcrops or shaded, moist soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
