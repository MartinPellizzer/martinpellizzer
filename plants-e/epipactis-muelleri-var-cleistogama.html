<p>Epipactis muelleri var. cleistogama, commonly known as the Mueller's helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant is notable for its cleistogamous flowers, which are self-pollinating and remain closed, a rare trait in orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
