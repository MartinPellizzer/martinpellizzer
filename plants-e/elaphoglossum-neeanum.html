<p>Elaphoglossum neeanum, commonly known as the Neenan's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
