                    <h1>Euphorbia multiformis var. tenuior</h1>
<p>Euphorbia multiformis var. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the plant's unique flower-like structures.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
