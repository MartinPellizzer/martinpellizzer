<p>Equisetum tarapacanum, commonly known as the Atacama horsetail, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a distinct distinction between the stem and the sporophylls, which are modified leaves that bear spores. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat.</p>
