                    <h1>Elaphoglossum nivosum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum nivosum, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or on rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Elaphoglossum nivosum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
