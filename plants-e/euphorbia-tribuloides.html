<p>Euphorbia tribuloides, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
