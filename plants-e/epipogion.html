                    <h1>Epipogion</h1>
<p>Epipogion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. Epipogion typically grows on decaying wood in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological niche and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
