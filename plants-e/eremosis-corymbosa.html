<p>Eremosis corymbosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, followed by small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Eremosis corymbosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments.</p>
