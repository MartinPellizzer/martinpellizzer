<p>Erodium heliotropioides, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that resemble those of the heliotrope, hence its common name. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Erodium heliotropioides is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a characteristic species of coastal vegetation.</p>
