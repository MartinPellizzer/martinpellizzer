<p>Eriocaulon miquelianum var. involucratum, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in shallow, still water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often studied for its potential in wetland restoration projects.</p>
