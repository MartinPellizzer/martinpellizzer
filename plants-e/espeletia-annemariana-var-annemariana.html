                    <h1>Espeletia annemariana var. annemariana</h1>
<p>Espeletia annemariana var. annemariana, commonly known as the "Páramo Heather," is a flowering plant native to the páramo ecosystems of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking violet or pink inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help protect it from intense UV radiation and desiccation.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in fragile mountain environments.</p>
