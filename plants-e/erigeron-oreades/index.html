                            <h1>Erigeron Oreades</h1>
<p>Erigeron oreades, commonly known as the mountain blueweed, is a delicate yet resilient flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. This member of the Asteraceae family is recognized for its fluffy white or blue-gray flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to more widely cultivated plants.</p>
