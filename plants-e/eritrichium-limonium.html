<p>Eritrichium limonium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant grows from a compact rosette of leaves and produces daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, and it is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Eritrichium limonium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
