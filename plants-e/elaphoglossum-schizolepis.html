                    <h1>Elaphoglossum schizolepis</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum schizolepis, commonly known as the split-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
