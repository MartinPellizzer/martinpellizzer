<p>Echinochloa crus-galli var. michauxii, commonly known as the common barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
