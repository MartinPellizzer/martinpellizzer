                    <h1>Eria brunea</h1>
<p>Eria brunea, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Eria brunea is considered vulnerable and is often sought after in the horticultural trade.</p>
