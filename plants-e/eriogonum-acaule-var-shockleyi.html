                    <h1>Eriogonum acaule var. shockleyi</h1>
<p>Eriogonum acaule var. shockleyi, commonly known as Shockley's stickybark, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its short, woody stems and clustered, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability. Its unique botanical features include glandular hairs that give it a sticky appearance, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
