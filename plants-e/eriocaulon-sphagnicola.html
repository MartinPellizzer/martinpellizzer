                    <h1>Eriocaulon sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon sphagnicola, commonly known as the peat moss fern, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic conditions typical of peat bogs and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and contribute to the formation of peat.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon sphagnicola plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting microbial and invertebrate life.</p>
