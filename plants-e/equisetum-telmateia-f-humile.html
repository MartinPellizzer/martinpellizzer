<p>Equisetum telmateia f. humile, commonly known as the dwarf scouring rush, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are cone-like and contain spores.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is notable for its ancient lineage and its role in ecological succession in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
