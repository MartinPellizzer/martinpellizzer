<p>Elaphoglossum maximum, commonly known as the large holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum maximum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
