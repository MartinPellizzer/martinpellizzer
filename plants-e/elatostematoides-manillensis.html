<p>Elatostematoides manillensis, commonly known as the Manila liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body covered in tiny, water-filled pores. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Elatostematoides manillensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
