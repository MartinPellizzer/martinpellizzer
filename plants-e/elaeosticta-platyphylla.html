<p>Elaeosticta platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf elaeosticta, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Bolivia, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Elaeosticta platyphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
