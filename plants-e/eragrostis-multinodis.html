<p>Eragrostis multinodis, commonly known as the nodular lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. Eragrostis multinodis is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
