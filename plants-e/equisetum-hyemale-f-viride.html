<p>Equisetum hyemale f. viride, commonly known as green horsehair grass, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, green stems that lack leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, typical of the Equisetum genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of silica has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
