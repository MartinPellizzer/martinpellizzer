                    <h1>Erythrodes epiphytica</h1>
<p>Erythrodes epiphytica, commonly known as the red-veined epiphyte, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically dark green with striking red veins, which help in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Erythrodes epiphytica is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
