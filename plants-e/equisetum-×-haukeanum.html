<p>Equisetum × haukeanum, commonly known as the hybrid horse tail, is a sterile hybrid of two species of horsetail.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It lacks true leaves and reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its structure resembles its parent species but exhibits unique morphological traits due to its hybrid origin.</p>
