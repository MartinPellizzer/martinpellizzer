<p>Elymus dasystachys var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, which is reflected in its varietal name "pauciflorus.". It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
