<p>Erysimum menziesii subsp.</p>
<p>eurekense, commonly known as the Eureka wallflower, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant features dense clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>
