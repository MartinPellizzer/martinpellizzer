<p>Erythroxylum rigidulum var. exareolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coca, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its rigid, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to elliptical, orange-red buds, which are the source of its psychoactive properties. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its alkaloid content, it has both traditional and modern significance in various cultural and medicinal contexts.</p>
