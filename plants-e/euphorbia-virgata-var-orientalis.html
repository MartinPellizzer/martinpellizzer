                    <h1>Euphorbia virgata var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia virgata var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Spurge, is a succulent plant native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has modified leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature common in many euphorbias for protection against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>
