                    <h1>Eremia tubercularis</h1>
<p>Eremia tubercularis, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its thick, tuberculate (wart-like) stems provide structural support and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremia tubercularis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
