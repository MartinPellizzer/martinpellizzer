                    <h1>Euphorbia terracina var. trapezoidalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia terracina var. trapezoidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, narrow, and often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some areas and may cause skin irritation due to its milky sap.</p>
