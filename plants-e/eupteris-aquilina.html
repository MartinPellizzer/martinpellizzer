<p>Eupteris aquilina, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and aquatic environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Eupteris aquilina plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
