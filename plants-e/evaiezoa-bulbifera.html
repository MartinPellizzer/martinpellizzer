                    <h1>Evaiezoa bulbifera</h1>
<p>Evaiezoa bulbifera, commonly known as the bulb-bearing evaiezoa, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its underground bulbs, which serve as storage organs for nutrients and water. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Evaiezoa bulbifera is currently classified as an endangered species.</p>
