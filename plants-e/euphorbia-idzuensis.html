                    <h1>Euphorbia idzuensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia idzuensis, commonly known as the Idzu's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in desert plants.</p>
<p>Euphorbia idzuensis is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a characteristic feature of many euphorbias.</p>
