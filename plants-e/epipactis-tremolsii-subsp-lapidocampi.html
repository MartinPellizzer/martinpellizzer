<p>Epipactis tremolsii subsp.</p>
<p>lapidocampi, commonly known as the Lapidocampi helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is listed as endangered in several countries due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
