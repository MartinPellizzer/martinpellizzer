<p>Echinopsis densispina var. amblayensis, commonly known as the Amblay's密集刺球, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of yellow and orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservatories.</p>
