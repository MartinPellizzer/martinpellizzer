                    <h1>Ephedra vulgaris var. monostachya</h1>
<p>Ephedra vulgaris var. monostachya, commonly known as the single-stem ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has historically been used in traditional medicine, though its use is now regulated due to potential toxicity.</p>
