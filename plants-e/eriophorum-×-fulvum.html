                    <h1>Eriophorum × fulvum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum × fulvum, commonly known as the yellow cottongrass, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fluffy, yellowish seed heads that appear in late summer and autumn. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it forms low, mat-like growths.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing peatlands and is often an indicator of wetland ecosystems.</p>
