<p>Eragrostis rejuvenescens, commonly known as the rejuvenating grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to regenerate quickly, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
