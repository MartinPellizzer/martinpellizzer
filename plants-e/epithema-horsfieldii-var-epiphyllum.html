                    <h1>Epithema horsfieldii var. epiphyllum</h1>
<p>Epithema horsfieldii var. epiphyllum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that often grow horizontally or pendulously, allowing it to thrive in tree canopies. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit.</p>
