                    <h1>Epipactis rubiginosa lusus viridiflora</h1>
<p>Epipactis rubiginosa lusus viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered adder's mouth, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure and coloration.</p>
<p>It features a striking greenish-yellow inflorescence with lip-like petals that mimic the appearance of an insect's mouth, aiding in pollination by specific flies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
