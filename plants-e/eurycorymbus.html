                    <h1>Eurycorymbus</h1>
<p>Eurycorymbus, commonly known as the broad-fruit tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines, and its trunk is typically unbranched with a smooth, grayish bark.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, several species within this genus are currently threatened with extinction.</p>
