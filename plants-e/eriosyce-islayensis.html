                    <h1>Eriosyce islayensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce islayensis, commonly known as the Islay nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its adaptations include a thick cuticle and succulent tissues that store water, enabling survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
