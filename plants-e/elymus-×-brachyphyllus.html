                    <h1>Elymus × brachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Elymus × brachyphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Elymus repens and Elymus farctus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in temperate regions and is characterized by its low stature, with slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a common weed and a useful forage plant.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, which contributes to its widespread distribution.</p>
