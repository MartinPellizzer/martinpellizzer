<p>Epidorkis calceolus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single cluster at the center of the rosette. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Epidorkis calceolus is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it thrives in cool, dry conditions.</p>
