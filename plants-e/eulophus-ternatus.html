                    <h1>Eulophus ternatus</h1>
<p>Eulophus ternatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gall wasp, is a small parasitic wasp species belonging to the family Eulophidae.</p>
<p>It is known for inducing galls on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the genus *Eucalyptus*. The larvae of *Eulophus ternatus* feed within these galls, which are abnormal growths formed in response to the wasp's oviposition. The plant's botanical response to the wasp's presence results in the formation of unique, often spherical or elongated galls.</p>
<p>This interaction highlights the complex relationships between insects and their host plants in ecological systems.</p>
