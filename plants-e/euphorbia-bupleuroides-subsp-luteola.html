<p>Euphorbia bupleuroides subsp.</p>
<p>luteola, commonly known as the yellow spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
