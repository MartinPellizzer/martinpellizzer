                    <h1>Exochaenium gracile</h1>
<p>Exochaenium gracile, commonly known as slender marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across moist soils.</p>
<p>Exochaenium gracile is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
