<p>Euphorbia greenwayi subsp.</p>
<p>greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with numerous erect, spiny branches that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
