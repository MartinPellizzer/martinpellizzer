                    <h1>Eremogone congesta var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Eremogone congesta var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular eremogone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branching stems that are often covered in small, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that contributes to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
