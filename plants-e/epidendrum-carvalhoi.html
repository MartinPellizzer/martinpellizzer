<p>Epidendrum carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant orange and yellow flowers.

It prefers well-draining substrates and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting, showy blooms that can last several months.</p>
