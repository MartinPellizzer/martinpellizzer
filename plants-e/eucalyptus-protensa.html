                    <h1>Eucalyptus protensa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus protensa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that open to reveal creamy-white or pale yellow flowers. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus protensa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
