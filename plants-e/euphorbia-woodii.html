                    <h1>Euphorbia woodii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia woodii, commonly known as the "living fossil" or "woodii's euphorbia," is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a distinctive, branched structure and a lack of true leaves. Euphorbia woodii is adapted to arid environments, with its succulent tissues storing water to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is highly protected and rarely found in the wild.</p>
