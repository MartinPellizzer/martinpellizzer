                    <h1>Echeveria pulverulenta var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Echeveria pulverulenta var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona powderblue echeveria, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy purple-pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a specimen plant in succulent collections.</p>
