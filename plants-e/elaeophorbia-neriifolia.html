                    <h1>Elaeophorbia neriifolia</h1>
<p>Elaeophorbia neriifolia, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Elaeophorbia neriifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is popular as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
