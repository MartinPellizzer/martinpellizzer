                    <h1>Eragrostis angusta</h1>
<p>Eragrostis angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
