                    <h1>Echinocactus simpsonii var. robustior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus simpsonii var. robustior, commonly known as the Simpson's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and prominent spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative ornamental plant in gardens and collections.</p>
