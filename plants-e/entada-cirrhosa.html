                    <h1>Entada cirrhosa</h1>
<p>Entada cirrhosa, commonly known as the "silk tree" or "silk bean," is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender pods that hang in clusters, often resembling silk threads, hence its common name. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense panicles. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
