                    <h1>Echinocactus ancylacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ancylacanthus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus ancylacanthus is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus gardens.</p>
