                    <h1>Echinodendrum campanulatum</h1>
<p>Echinodendrum campanulatum, commonly known as the bellflower echinodendrum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinodendrum campanulatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
