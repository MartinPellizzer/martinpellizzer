                    <h1>Echinocactus stuemeri</h1>
<p>Echinocactus stuemeri, commonly known as the Stuemmer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged exterior. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus stuemeri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
