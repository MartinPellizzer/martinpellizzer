<p>Echinochloa crus-galli subsp.</p>
<p>muricata, commonly known as cocklebur grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed husk, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
