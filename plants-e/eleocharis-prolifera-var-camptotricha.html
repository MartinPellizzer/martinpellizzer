                    <h1>Eleocharis prolifera var. camptotricha</h1>
<p>Eleocharis prolifera var. camptotricha, commonly known as the spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-lobed, dry fruits that disperse seeds through water or wind.</p>
