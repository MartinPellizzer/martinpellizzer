<p>Echeveria bella var. major, commonly known as the Giant Echeveria, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often tinged with purple at the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy pink to lavender flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is relatively easy to maintain and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
