<p>Excoecaria canjoerensis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird and marine species. Its prop roots provide structural support in soft, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Excoecaria canjoerensis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
