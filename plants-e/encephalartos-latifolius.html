                    <h1>Encephalartos latifolius</h1>
<p>Encephalartos latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their large, spiny structures. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
