                    <h1>Euphorbia esula var. saratoi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia esula var. saratoi, commonly known as the Siberian spurge, is a perennial plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
