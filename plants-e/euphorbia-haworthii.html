<p>Euphorbia haworthii, commonly known as the Haworth's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
