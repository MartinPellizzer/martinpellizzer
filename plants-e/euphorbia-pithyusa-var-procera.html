                    <h1>Euphorbia pithyusa var. procera</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pithyusa var. procera, commonly known as the giant crown-of-thorns, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a unique, gelatinous cyathium, which is a type of floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its sharp spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
