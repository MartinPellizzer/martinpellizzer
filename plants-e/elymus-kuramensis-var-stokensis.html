<p>Elymus kuramensis var. stokensis, commonly known as the Kuram grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces slender, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, high-elevation habitats.</p>
