                <h1>Elymus repens</h1>
<p>Elymus repens, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Elymus repens is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
