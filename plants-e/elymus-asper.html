                    <h1>Elymus asper</h1>
<p>Elymus asper, commonly known as rough false wheat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands, and is often found in moist to dry habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Elymus asper is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
