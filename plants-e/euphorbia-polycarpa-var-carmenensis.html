<p>Euphorbia polycarpa var. carmenensis, commonly known as Carmen's milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branched structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
