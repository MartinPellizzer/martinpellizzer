<p>Euphorbia lucorum var. simplicior, commonly known as the smooth euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, compact form with fleshy, greenish-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its characteristic floral structures. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled settings.</p>
