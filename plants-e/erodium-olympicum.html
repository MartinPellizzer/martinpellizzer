<p>Erodium olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it has a trailing habit that allows it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>Erodium olympicum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
