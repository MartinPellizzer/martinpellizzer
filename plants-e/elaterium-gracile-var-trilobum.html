                    <h1>Elaterium gracile var. trilobum</h1>
<p>Elaterium gracile var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed elaterium, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that often exhibit a distinct three-lobed shape. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
