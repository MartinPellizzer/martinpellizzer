<p>Echinocactus villosus var. niger, commonly known as the black-hairy cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in dense, dark-colored spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its dark foliage. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and requiring minimal care.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections.</p>
