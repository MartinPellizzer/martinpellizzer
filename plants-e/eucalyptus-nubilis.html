                    <h1>Eucalyptus nubilis</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus nubilis, commonly known as the misty gum, is a tall, slender tree native to the wetter coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous underlayer, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically pale green and covered in a fine, white bloom. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white or cream flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its essential oils, rich in eucalyptol, are widely used in medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to humid climates and is often found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats.</p>
