<p>Espeletia rositae subsp.</p>
<p>macrocephala, commonly known as the giant rosette plant, is a species native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, dense rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to the arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking pink or purple flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is also of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
