<p>Eria obesa, commonly known as the fat cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem for survival. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eria obesa is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
