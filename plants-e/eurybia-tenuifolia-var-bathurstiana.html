                    <h1>Eurybia tenuifolia var. bathurstiana</h1>
<p>Eurybia tenuifolia var. bathurstiana, commonly known as Bathurst's brittleweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
