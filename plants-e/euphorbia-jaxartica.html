<p>Euphorbia jaxartica, commonly known as the Jaxartian spurge, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia jaxartica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
