<p>Echinocereus longisetus subsp.</p>
<p>delaetii, commonly known as the Delaet's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a columnar stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
