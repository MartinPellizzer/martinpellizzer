                    <h1>Eutoca acaulis</h1>
<p>Eutoca acaulis, commonly known as the leafless gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a short, sturdy stem that bears clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are tubular and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eutoca acaulis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
