                    <h1>Equisetum affine</h1>
<p>Equisetum affine, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically found near the ground. Equisetum affine is often found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant groups.</p>
