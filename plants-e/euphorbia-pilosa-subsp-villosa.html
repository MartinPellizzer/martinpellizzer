<p>Euphorbia pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
