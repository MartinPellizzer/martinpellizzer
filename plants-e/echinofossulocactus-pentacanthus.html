                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus pentacanthus</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus pentacanthus, commonly known as the five-spined echinofossulocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
