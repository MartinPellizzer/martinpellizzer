<p>Epipactis condensata, commonly known as the dense epipactis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions and is protected in several countries.</p>
