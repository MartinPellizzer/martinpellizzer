<p>Eumorpha variegata, commonly known as the variegated swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Papilionidae and is characterized by its distinctive coloration, featuring a combination of black, white, and orange markings. The adult butterfly has a wingspan of approximately 7 to 10 centimeters, with the male typically having more vibrant coloration than the female. Its larvae feed on plants in the family Rutaceae, such as citrus trees, and the plant's chemical compounds play a role in the caterpillar's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>The plant's role in the life cycle of Eumorpha variegata is essential for both larval development and adult nectar feeding.</p>
