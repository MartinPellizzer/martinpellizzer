<p>Ephedra wraithiana, commonly known as the ghost ephedra, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that resemble the skeletal structures of ancient trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Ephedra wraithiana is notable for its chemical composition, containing ephedrine, a compound historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
