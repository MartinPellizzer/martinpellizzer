<p>Ebnerella barbata, commonly known as the barbed waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive barbed appearance along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Ebnerella barbata is often found in still or slow-moving waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
