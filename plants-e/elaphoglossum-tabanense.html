<p>Elaphoglossum tabanense, commonly known as the Tabanense holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum tabanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
