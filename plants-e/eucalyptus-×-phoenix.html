                    <h1>Eucalyptus × phoenix</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × phoenix, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus robusta and Eucalyptus saligna.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, featuring smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are long, narrow, and lance-shaped, typically with a blue-green hue when mature. It produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to the coastal and subcoastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
