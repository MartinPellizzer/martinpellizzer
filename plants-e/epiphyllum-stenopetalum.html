<p>Epiphyllum stenopetalum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and shed before flowering, a feature common in many cacti.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
