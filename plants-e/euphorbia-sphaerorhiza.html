                    <h1>Euphorbia sphaerorhiza</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sphaerorhiza, commonly known as the globe spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sphaerorhiza is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
