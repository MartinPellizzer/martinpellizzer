                    <h1>Ephemerantha chrysographata</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha chrysographata, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a star-shaped pattern, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires a well-drained substrate to prevent root rot. Its growth is slow, and it often forms compact clumps with a few flowering stems each year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
