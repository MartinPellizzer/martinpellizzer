<p>Euphorbia neoreflexa, commonly known as the reflexed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia neoreflexa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
