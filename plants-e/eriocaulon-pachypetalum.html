                    <h1>Eriocaulon pachypetalum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon pachypetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
