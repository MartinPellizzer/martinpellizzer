<p>Eremopyrum dasyphyllum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of soft, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense vegetation mats, which stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eremopyrum dasyphyllum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
