<p>Elaphoglossum lineare var. klotzchii, commonly known as the Klotzch's narrow-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaf holly fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and often grows in association with other shade-tolerant plants.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
