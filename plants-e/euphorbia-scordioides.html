                    <h1>Euphorbia scordioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scordioides, commonly known as the garlic euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique cyathium structure, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
