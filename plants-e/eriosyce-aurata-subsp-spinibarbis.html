<p>Eriosyce aurata subsp.</p>
<p>spinibarbis, commonly known as the spiny-barbed cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found growing in rocky soils.</p>
