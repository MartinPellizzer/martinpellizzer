                    <h1>Euphorbia franksiae var. zuluensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia franksiae var. zuluensis, commonly known as the Zulu euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
