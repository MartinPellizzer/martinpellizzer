<p>Ecbolium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on photosynthesis for energy.</p>
<p>Ecbolium flexuosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
