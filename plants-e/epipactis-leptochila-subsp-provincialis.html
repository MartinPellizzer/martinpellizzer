<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>provincialis, commonly known as the Alpine marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands at high altitudes. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
