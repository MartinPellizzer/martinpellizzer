                    <h1>Euphorbia atoto</h1>
<p>Euphorbia atoto, commonly known as the atoto spurge, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Euphorbia atoto is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its toxic sap contains irritants, so it should be handled with care.</p>
