                    <h1>Echidiocarya</h1>
<p>Echidiocarya, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Davalliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, a feature that aids in its survival in competitive understory habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Echidiocarya offers insights into the evolutionary adaptations of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns.</p>
