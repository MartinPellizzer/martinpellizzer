                    <h1>Eleocharis purpurascens</h1>
<p>Eleocharis purpurascens, commonly known as purple spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that turns a striking purple hue as it matures. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its slender, leaf-like stems are often mistaken for grasses, but they lack the jointed structure typical of true grasses.</p>
<p>Eleocharis purpurascens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
