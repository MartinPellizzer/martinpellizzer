<p>Euphorbia segetalis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract euphorbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
