                <h1>Equisetum trachyodon</h1>
<p>Equisetum trachyodon, commonly known as the scaly horse-hair fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure reflects its ancient lineage.</p>
<p>Equisetum trachyodon is considered a living fossil due to its minimal morphological changes over millions of years.</p>
