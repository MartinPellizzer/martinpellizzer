                    <h1>Erithalis fruticosa var. inodora</h1>
<p>Erithalis fruticosa var. inodora, commonly known as the scentless thimbleweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its lack of a strong fragrance, unlike other varieties of Erithalis fruticosa.</p>
