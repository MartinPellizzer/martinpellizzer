<p>Eriocaulon lividum, commonly known as the silver spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Eriocaulon lividum is often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>Its silver-gray sheen on the leaves gives it its common name and helps it reflect excess light in its aquatic environment.</p>
