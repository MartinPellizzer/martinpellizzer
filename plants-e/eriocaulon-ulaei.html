<p>Eriocaulon ulaei, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Eriocaulon ulaei typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland biodiversity and ecological studies.</p>
