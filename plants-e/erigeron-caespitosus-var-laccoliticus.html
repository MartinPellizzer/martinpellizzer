                    <h1>Erigeron caespitosus var. laccoliticus</h1>
<p>Erigeron caespitosus var. laccoliticus, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often found in sandy or rocky soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of desert ecosystems.</p>
