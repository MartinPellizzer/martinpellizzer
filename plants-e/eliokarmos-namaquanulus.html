<p>Eliokarmos namaquanulus, commonly known as the Namibian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the rainy season. It grows close to the ground, forming dense clusters that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for extreme desert environments.</p>
