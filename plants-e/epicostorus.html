<p>Epicostorus, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and the presence of stinging hairs on their stems and leaves, similar to true nettles. They are typically herbaceous and can be found in moist, shaded environments across temperate regions. The flowers are small and clustered, often green or yellowish, and are usually wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Epicostorus species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
