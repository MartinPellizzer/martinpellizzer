<p>Elaphoglossum thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
