<p>Echinocereus ortegae subsp.</p>
<p>ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a short-lived perennial cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in succulent gardens.</p>
