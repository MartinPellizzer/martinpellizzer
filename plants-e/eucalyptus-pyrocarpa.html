                    <h1>Eucalyptus pyrocarpa</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus pyrocarpa, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a tall, slender tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in long strips, and its lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The tree produces small, globular clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus pyrocarpa is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment.</p>
