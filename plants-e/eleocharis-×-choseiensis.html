<p>Eleocharis × choseiensis, commonly known as the hybrid spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common component of marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture, and it often forms dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
