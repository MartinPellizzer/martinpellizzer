                            <h1>Elaphoglossum Ciliatum</h1>
<p>Ciliated elaphoglossum, scientifically known as Elaphoglossum ciliatum, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Elaphoglossaceae. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its finely toothed fronds and distinctive cilia along the leaf margins make it easily identifiable. Despite its small size, this plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by supporting various microorganisms and insect life. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats of decline, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
