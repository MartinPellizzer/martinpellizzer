<p>Euphorbia yattana, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures. Its leaves are typically small and may be present or reduced, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia yattana is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
