<p>Euphorbia neohalipedicola, commonly known as the sand euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to Namibia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem with a smooth, pale green surface that helps it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Euphorbia neohalipedicola is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
