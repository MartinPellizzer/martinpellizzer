                    <h1>Eugenia glomerata var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Eugenia glomerata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a variant of the guava species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the standard Eugenia glomerata. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically edible.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variety make it suitable for ornamental gardening and, in some cases, for fruit production in suitable climates.</p>
