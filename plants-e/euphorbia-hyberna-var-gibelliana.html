The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it should be handled with care to avoid skin irritation.</p>
