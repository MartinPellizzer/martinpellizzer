                    <h1>Equisetum × trachyodon f. geminatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum × trachyodon f. geminatum, commonly known as the twin-stemmed horsetail, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems.</p>
<p>It features whorled leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common trait in the Equisetum genus. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in a distinctive, brush-like arrangement. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to form dense clumps through vegetative propagation, contributing to its ecological significance in certain habitats.</p>
