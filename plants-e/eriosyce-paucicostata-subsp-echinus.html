<p>Eriosyce paucicostata subsp.</p>
<p>echinus, commonly known as the echinata cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny tubercles, which provide structural support and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny form. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
