<p>Elytrigia lolioides, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Elytrigia lolioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock.</p>
