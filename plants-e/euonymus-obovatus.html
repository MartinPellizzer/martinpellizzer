                    <h1>Euonymus obovatus</h1>
<p>Euonymus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
