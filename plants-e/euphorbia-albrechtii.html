                    <h1>Euphorbia albrechtii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia albrechtii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so handling requires caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia albrechtii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
