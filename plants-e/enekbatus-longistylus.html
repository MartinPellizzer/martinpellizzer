                    <h1>Enekbatus longistylus</h1>
<p>Enekbatus longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled enekbatus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated stamens that can extend up to twice the length of the petals, making it visually distinctive. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Enekbatus longistylus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
