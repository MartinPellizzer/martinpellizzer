<p>Elaeagnus perrottetii, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that turn red or orange in the fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Elaeagnus perrottetii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
