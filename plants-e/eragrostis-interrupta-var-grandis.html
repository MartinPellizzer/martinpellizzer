<p>Eragrostis interrupta var. grandis, commonly known as giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to reddish in color.
