                    <h1>Euphorbia gerardiana var. sturii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gerardiana var. sturii, commonly known as the Sturii's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
