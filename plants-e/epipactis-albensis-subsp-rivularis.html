<p>Epipactis albensis subsp.</p>
<p>rivularis, commonly known as the river marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, yellow-green flower with a distinctive, hairy lip.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and often grows in association with other wetland flora. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status.</p>
