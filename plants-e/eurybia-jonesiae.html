<p>Eurybia jonesiae, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Eurybia jonesiae is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
