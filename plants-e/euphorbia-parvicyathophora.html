                    <h1>Euphorbia parvicyathophora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia parvicyathophora, commonly known as the dwarf candleplant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
