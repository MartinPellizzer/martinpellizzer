                    <h1>Eleocharis acicularis var. lilliputiana</h1>
<p>Eleocharis acicularis var. lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its small size, often less than 10 cm tall, contributes to its unique appearance and ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
