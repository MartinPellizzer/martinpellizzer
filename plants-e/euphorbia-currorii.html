<p>Euphorbia currorii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are typically green and may have a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia currorii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
