                    <h1>Euphorbia dregeana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dregeana, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, branching stems covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution.</p>
