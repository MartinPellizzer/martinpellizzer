                    <h1>Euphorbia eriantha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eriantha, commonly known as the silver leaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is advised when handling the plant.</p>
