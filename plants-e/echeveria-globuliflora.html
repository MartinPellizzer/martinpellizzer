<p>Echeveria globuliflora, commonly known as the globular echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its compact shape.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
