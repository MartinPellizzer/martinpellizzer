                    <h1>Euphorbia serratifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in small, spiny leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
