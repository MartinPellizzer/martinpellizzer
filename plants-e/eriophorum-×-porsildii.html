                    <h1>Eriophorum × porsildii</h1>
<p>Eriophorum × porsildii, commonly known as the hybrid tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eriophorum × porsildii is a composite species resulting from the cross between Eriophorum angustifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum.</p>
