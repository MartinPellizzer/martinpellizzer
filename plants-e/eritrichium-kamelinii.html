<p>Eritrichium kamelinii, commonly known as Kamelin's alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes.
