                    <h1>Epipactis × heterogama</h1>
<p>Epipactis × heterogama, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Epipactis palustris and Epipactis helleborine.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes and meadows. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its ability to hybridize naturally in the wild, leading to genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the orchid family.</p>
