                    <h1>Elaeagnus umbellata var. siphonantha</h1>
<p>Elaeagnus umbellata var. siphonantha, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbellate clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
