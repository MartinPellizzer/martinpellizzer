                    <h1>Espeletia sericea</h1>
<p>Espeletia sericea, commonly known as the woolly tree heather, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Espeletia sericea is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in Andean flora.</p>
