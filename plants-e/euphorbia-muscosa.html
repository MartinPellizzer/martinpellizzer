                    <h1>Euphorbia muscosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia muscosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
