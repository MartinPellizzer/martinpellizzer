                    <h1>Epallage longipes</h1>
<p>Epallage longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epallage, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, wiry stems that can grow several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along the forest floor. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Epallage longipes is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
