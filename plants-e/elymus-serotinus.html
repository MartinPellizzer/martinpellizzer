                    <h1>Elymus serotinus</h1>
<p>Elymus serotinus, commonly known as winter wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important species for erosion control and forage in agricultural settings.</p>
