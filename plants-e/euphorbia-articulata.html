                    <h1>Euphorbia articulata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia articulata, commonly known as the jointed spurges, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, often spiny stems that are segmented and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellow or greenish hues, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent structure and ability to store water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia articulata is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
