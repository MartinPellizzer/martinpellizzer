                    <h1>Erythroxylum loretense</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum loretense, commonly known as the Loretense Coca, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing the seeds. It is notable for its potential medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically cultivated for coca alkaloids like its more well-known relative, Erythroxylum coca.</p>
