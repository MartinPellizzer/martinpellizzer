<p>Erechtites hieraciifolius var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
