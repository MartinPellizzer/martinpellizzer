                    <h1>Eremanthus plantaginifolius</h1>
<p>Eremanthus plantaginifolius, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
