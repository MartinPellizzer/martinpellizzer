<p>Echinopsis litoralis, commonly known as the sea urchin cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are typically short and white, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Echinopsis litoralis is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high salt exposure due to its coastal habitat.</p>
