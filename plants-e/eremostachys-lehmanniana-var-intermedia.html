                    <h1>Eremostachys lehmanniana var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Eremostachys lehmanniana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate eremostachys, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to poor soils and high sunlight exposure, making it a resilient species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
