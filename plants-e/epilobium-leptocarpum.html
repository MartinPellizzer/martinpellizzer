<p>Epilobium leptocarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Epilobium leptocarpum is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments.</p>
