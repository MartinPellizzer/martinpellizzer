<p>Evelyna discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Evelyna discolor is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
