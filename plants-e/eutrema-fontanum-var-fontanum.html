                    <h1>Eutrema fontanum var. fontanum</h1>
<p>Eutrema fontanum var. fontanum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitat.</p>
<p>Eutrema fontanum var. fontanum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
