                    <h1>Elisma natans f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Elisma natans f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating elisma, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a variant of Elisma natans, characterized by its fully submerged leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
