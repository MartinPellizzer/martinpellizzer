<p>Elaphoglossum longifolium var. pastazensis, commonly known as the Pastaza holly fern, is a variant of the long-leaved holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and is native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
