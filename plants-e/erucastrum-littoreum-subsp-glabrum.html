<p>Erucastrum littoreum subsp.</p>
<p>glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the shores of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its structure is low-growing, with a rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises from the center.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
