<p>Ephedra cutleri, commonly known as the Desert Tea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Ephedra cutleri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems and minimize water loss through its reduced foliage.</p>
<p>It has been historically used by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes.</p>
