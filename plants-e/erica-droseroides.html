<p>Erica droseroides, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized gardens.</p>
