<p>Epilobium gemmascens, commonly known as the gemma or gemma plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. Epilobium gemmascens is characterized by its ability to propagate through vegetative means, including the production of gemmae, which are small, specialized structures that can develop into new plants.</p>
<p>This adaptability makes it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
