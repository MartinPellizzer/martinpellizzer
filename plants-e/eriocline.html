                    <h1>Eriocline</h1>
<p>Eriocline, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of other trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Eriocline is typically found in temperate regions and can be a persistent presence on its host trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and visually distinctive in forest environments.</p>
