                    <h1>Equisetum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Equisetum × intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate horsetail, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum hyemale.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, tooth-like structures, and it thrives in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Equisetum × intermedium is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
