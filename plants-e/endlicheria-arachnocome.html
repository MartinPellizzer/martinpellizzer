<p>Endlicheria arachnocome, commonly known as the spider-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features long, thin stems ending in a cluster of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
