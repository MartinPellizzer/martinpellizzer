                    <h1>Echinocereus sciurus var. floresii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus sciurus var. floresii, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and enabling survival in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to low-water environments and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
