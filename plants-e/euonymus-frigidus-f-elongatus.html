                    <h1>Euonymus frigidus f. elongatus</h1>
<p>Euonymus frigidus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated frost euonymus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, providing a subtle contrast. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
