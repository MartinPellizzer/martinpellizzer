<p>Erica aspalathoides, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils.
