<p>Euphorbia paui, commonly known as the Pau Island spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Pau, in the Comoros archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.
