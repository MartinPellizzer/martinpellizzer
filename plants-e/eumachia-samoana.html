                    <h1>Eumachia samoana</h1>
<p>Eumachia samoana, commonly known as the Samoan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific islands, particularly Samoa and nearby regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are small, oval, and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eumachia samoana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, though its parasitic nature can weaken host trees over time.</p>
