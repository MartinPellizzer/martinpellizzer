                    <h1>Erica acuta var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Erica acuta var. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
