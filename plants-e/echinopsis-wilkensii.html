                    <h1>Echinopsis wilkensii</h1>
<p>Echinopsis wilkensii, commonly known as the Wilken's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed stem, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to survive in arid environments, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Echinopsis wilkensii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
