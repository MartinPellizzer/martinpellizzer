                    <h1>Euphorbia dissitispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dissitispina, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as its sap can cause skin irritation.</p>
