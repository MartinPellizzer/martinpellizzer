<p>Erioscirpus microstachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Erioscirpus microstachyus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
