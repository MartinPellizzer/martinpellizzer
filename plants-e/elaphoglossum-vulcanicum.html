                    <h1>Elaphoglossum vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic holly fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to high-altitude volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Elaphoglossum vulcanicum is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in volcanic ecosystems.</p>
