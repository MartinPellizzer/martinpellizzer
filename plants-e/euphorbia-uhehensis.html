                    <h1>Euphorbia uhehensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia uhehensis, commonly known as the Uhehena spurge, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and latex contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia uhehensis is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties.</p>
