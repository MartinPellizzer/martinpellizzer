                    <h1>Eleocharis × myogiensis</h1>
<p>Eleocharis × myogiensis, commonly known as the hybrid spikerush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Eleocharis acutiformis and Eleocharis yokohamae. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true flowers, instead producing small, inconspicuous spikelets.</p>
<p>This species is often found in marshy areas and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
