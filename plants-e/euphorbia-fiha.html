                    <h1>Euphorbia fiha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fiha, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and striking specimen.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and unique appearance, Euphorbia fiha is protected in its native habitat.</p>
