<p>Echinocereus cinerascens, commonly known as the silver cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
<p>Echinocereus cinerascens is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
