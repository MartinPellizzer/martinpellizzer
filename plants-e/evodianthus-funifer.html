                    <h1>Evodianthus funifer</h1>
<p>Evodianthus funifer, commonly known as the slender euphorbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with small, green leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant's latex, like that of many Euphorbiaceae species, contains irritants and should be handled with care.</p>
