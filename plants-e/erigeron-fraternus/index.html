                            <h1>Erigeron Fraternus</h1>
<p>Erigeron fraternus, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers. This perennial plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small stature and subtle blooms make it a hardy yet often overlooked member of the flora. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems.</p>
