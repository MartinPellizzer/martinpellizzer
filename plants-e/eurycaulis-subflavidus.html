                    <h1>Eurycaulis subflavidus</h1>
<p>Eurycaulis subflavidus, commonly known as the golden-flowered eurycaulis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Eurycaulis subflavidus is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
