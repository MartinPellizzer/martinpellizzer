                    <h1>Echinocereus schwarzii</h1>
<p>Echinocereus schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwerz's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch out. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a potted plant.</p>
