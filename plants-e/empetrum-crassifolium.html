                    <h1>Empetrum crassifolium</h1>
<p>Empetrum crassifolium, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments makes it an important component of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Empetrum crassifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
