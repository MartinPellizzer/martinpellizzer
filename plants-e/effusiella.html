                    <h1>Effusiella</h1>
<p>Effusiella, commonly known as the moss-like plant, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structures that grow close to the ground, often in moist and shaded environments. The plants typically have a thalloid body, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure covered in tiny, overlapping leaves. Effusiella species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of environmental conditions and their contribution to soil stability in forest ecosystems.</p>
