<p>Echinocactus intortus var. purpureus, commonly known as the Purple Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique variant of the Echinocactus genus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, spiny, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a striking purple hue, especially in the varietal form. The leaves are reduced to spines, and the plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
