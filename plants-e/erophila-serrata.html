<p>Erophila serrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, linear leaves that are often serrated at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Erophila serrata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
