<p>Elytropappus glandulosus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved glandular euphorbia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with numerous branching stems that are often covered in glandular hairs. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-yellow inflorescences, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
