                    <h1>Euphorbia lactea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lactea, commonly known as the White Spine Cactus, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in white, waxy tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown as a decorative houseplant.</p>
