                            <h1>Erica Elgonensis</h1>
<p>Erica elgonensis is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, specifically found in the Virunga volcanic ranges. This evergreen shrub is known for its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erica elgonensis is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique plant from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
