                    <h1>Eucephalus perelegans</h1>
<p>Eucephalus perelegans, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in dry climates.</p>
