                    <h1>Erythroxylum striolatum</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum striolatum, commonly known as the striated coca, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsules containing elliptical, whitish seeds. It is notable for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, particularly cocaine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other coca species due to its lower alkaloid content.</p>
