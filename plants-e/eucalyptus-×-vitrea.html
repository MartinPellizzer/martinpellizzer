                    <h1>Eucalyptus × vitrea</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × vitrea, commonly known as the silver ash eucalyptus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus cinerea and Eucalyptus viminalis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically pale green to yellow in color.</p>
<p>This species is native to southeastern Australia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
