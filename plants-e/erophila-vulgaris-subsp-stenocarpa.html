<p>Erophila vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in late summer. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, enhancing its adaptability to varying wetland conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other subspecies of Erophila vulgaris.</p>
