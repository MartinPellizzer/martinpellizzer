                    <h1>Epidendrum atonum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum atonum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in warm and humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining potting media and bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
