                    <h1>Epipactis helleborine var. renzii</h1>
<p>Epipactis helleborine var. renzii, commonly known as the Renziâ€™s helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more elongated petals compared to the typical form of E. helleborine.</p>
