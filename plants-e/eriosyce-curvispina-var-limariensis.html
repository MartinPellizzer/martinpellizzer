                    <h1>Eriosyce curvispina var. limariensis</h1>
<p>Eriosyce curvispina var. limariensis, commonly known as the Limari Desert Cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a short, thick stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring season, which are pollinated by insects. Its adaptations to arid environments include a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly rare and is found in limited areas along the Limari River valley.</p>
