                    <h1>Euphorbia werneri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with a caudex and produces striking, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
<p>However, like many euphorbias, it contains toxic milky sap that can cause skin irritation.</p>
