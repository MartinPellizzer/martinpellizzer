<p>Echinocactus victoriensis, commonly known as the Victoria's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, segmented structure, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, waxy skin reduces water loss, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Echinocactus victoriensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
