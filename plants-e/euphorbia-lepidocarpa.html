                    <h1>Euphorbia lepidocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lepidocarpa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lepidocarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resistance to pests and diseases.</p>
