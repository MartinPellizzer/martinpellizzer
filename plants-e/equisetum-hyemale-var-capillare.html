                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale var. capillare</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale var. capillare, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a variety of the common horsetail that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in shady, damp conditions.</p>
