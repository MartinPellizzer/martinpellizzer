<p>Eriocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Eriocereus species are often drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
