                    <h1>Epipactis leptochila f. altensteiniana</h1>
<p>Epipactis leptochila f. altensteiniana, commonly known as the Altenstein's narrow-leaved helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This orchid is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a terrestrial plant that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation priority due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
