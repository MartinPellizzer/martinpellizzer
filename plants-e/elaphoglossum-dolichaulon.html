<p>Elaphoglossum dolichaulon, commonly known as the long-stalked holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum dolichaulon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
