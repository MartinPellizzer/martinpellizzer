                    <h1>Erythraea palustris</h1>
<p>Erythraea palustris, commonly known as the marsh erythraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erythraea palustris plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
