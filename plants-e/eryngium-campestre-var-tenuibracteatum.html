<p>Eryngium campestre var. tenuibracteatum, commonly known as narrow-bracted thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has spiny, lobed leaves that are often hairy, and it produces a distinctive, spiky flower head. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced bracts, which are shorter and less prominent compared to the typical E. campestre.</p>
