                    <h1>Epithema rennellense</h1>
<p>Epithema rennellense, commonly known as the Rennell island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical island of Rennell in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near the forest floor in humid tropical climates. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic distribution and habitat specificity, Epithema rennellense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
