                    <h1>Eleocharis savatieri</h1>
<p>Eleocharis savatieri, commonly known as the swamp arrowgrass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, a common reproductive strategy in wetland plants. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Eleocharis savatieri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and support biodiversity.</p>
