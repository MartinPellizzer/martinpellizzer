                    <h1>Eragrostis plumosa var. maritima</h1>
<p>Eragrostis plumosa var. maritima, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a coastal grass species native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive, plume-like appearance. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in arid or salty environments.</p>
