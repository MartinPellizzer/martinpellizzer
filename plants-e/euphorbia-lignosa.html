<p>Euphorbia lignosa, commonly known as the lignous spurge, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lignosa is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
