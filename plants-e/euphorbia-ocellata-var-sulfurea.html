                    <h1>Euphorbia ocellata var. sulfurea</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ocellata var. sulfurea, commonly known as the golden crown euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
