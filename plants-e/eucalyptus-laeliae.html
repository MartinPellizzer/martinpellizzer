                    <h1>Eucalyptus laeliae</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus laeliae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Eucalyptus laeliae is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and for their insect-repelling properties.</p>
