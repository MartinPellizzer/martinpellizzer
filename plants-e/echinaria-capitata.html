                    <h1>Echinaria capitata</h1>
<p>Echinaria capitata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to the desert landscape. Its leaves are typically small, waxy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinaria capitata is well adapted to extreme heat and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
