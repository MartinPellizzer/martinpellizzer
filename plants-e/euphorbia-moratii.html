<p>Euphorbia moratii, commonly known as the Morat's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive stem structure with a swollen, ribbed appearance, typical of many euphorbias. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia moratii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
