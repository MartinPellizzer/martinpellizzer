<p>Erianthus alopecuroides var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself make it a resilient choice for ecological restoration projects.</p>
