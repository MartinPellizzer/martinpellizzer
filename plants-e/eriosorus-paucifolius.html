                    <h1>Eriosorus paucifolius</h1>
<p>Eriosorus paucifolius, commonly known as the sparse-leaved eriosorus, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in relatively undisturbed, humid ecosystems.</p>
