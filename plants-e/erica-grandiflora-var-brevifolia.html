<p>Erica grandiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
