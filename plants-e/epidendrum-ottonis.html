<p>Epidendrum ottonis, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum ottonis is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
