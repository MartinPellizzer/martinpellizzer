                    <h1>Echinocereus pectinatus var. neomexicanus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus pectinatus var. neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes.</p>
