<p>Elaphoglossum indrapurae, commonly known as the Indrapura holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
