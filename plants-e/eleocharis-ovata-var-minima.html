<p>Eleocharis ovata var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, three-lobed flowers. This variety is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant's rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas quickly.</p>
