                    <h1>Erica droseroides var. minor</h1>
<p>Erica droseroides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a small, mat-forming plant native to the moist, acidic heathlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, sticky glands that secrete a mucilage to trap insects, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers appearing in summer. Its leaves are glandular and appear as a rosette, contributing to its appearance of being covered in dew.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique carnivorous behavior.</p>
