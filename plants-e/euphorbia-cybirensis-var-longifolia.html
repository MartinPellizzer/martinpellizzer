                    <h1>Euphorbia cybirensis var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia cybirensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with long, narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a white, waxy structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
