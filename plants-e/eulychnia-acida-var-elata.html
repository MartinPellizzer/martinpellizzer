                    <h1>Eulychnia acida var. elata</h1>
<p>Eulychnia acida var. elata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Eulychnia acida var. elata is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
