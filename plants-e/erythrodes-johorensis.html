                    <h1>Erythrodes johorensis</h1>
<p>Erythrodes johorensis, commonly known as the Johore red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia and parts of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red petals and a distinctive greenish-yellow lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Erythrodes johorensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
