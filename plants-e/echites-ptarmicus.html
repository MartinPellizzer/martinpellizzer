<p>Echites ptarmicus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the dry season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Echites ptarmicus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
