                    <h1>Epidendrum exasperatum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum exasperatum, commonly known as the Spiny Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they can grow on other plants without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Epidendrum exasperatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
