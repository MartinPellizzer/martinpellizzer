<p>Eragrostis nigra var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, slender leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-colored florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to warm climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful forage crop and an invasive weed in some regions.</p>
