                    <h1>Echinocactus pumilus var. gracillimus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus pumilus var. gracillimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
