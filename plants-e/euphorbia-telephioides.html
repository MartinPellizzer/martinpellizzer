                    <h1>Euphorbia telephioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia telephioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Euphorbia telephioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
