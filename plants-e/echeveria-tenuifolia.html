                    <h1>Echeveria tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Echeveria tenuifolia, commonly known as the "Baby Toes," is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces upright, branching stems with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its compact form.</p>
<p>Echeveria tenuifolia is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
