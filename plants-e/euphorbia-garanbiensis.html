<p>Euphorbia garanbiensis, commonly known as the Garanbi spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Euphorbia. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
