                    <h1>Elaphoglossum bicolor</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two color zones—green and brown—giving it its common name. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study in fern morphology.</p>
