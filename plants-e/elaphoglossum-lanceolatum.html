                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unique morphology make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
