                    <h1>Elaphoglossum meladenium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum meladenium, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky coastlines and in coastal forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum meladenium is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
