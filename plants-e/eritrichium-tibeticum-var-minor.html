                    <h1>Eritrichium tibeticum var. minor</h1>
<p>Eritrichium tibeticum var. minor, commonly known as the Tibetan dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
