The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Echinocactus plaschnickii is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family.</p>
