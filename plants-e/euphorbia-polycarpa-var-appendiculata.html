                    <h1>Euphorbia polycarpa var. appendiculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polycarpa var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and stores water in its stems for survival during droughts.</p>
<p>The sap of this plant contains latex, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
