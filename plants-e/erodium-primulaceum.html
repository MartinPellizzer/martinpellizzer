                    <h1>Erodium primulaceum</h1>
<p>Erodium primulaceum, commonly known as the common stickyweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a sticky surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and roadside areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
