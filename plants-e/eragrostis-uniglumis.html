                    <h1>Eragrostis uniglumis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis uniglumis, commonly known as slender lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
