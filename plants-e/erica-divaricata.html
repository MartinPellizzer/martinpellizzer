                    <h1>Erica divaricata</h1>
<p>Erica divaricata, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica divaricata is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
