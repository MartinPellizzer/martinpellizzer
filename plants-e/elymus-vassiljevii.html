                    <h1>Elymus vassiljevii</h1>
<p>Elymus vassiljevii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Elymus vassiljevii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
