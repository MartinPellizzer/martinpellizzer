                    <h1>Echeveria lanceolata var. incerta</h1>
<p>Echeveria lanceolata var. incerta, commonly known as the uncertain lanceleaf echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy texture. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pink to magenta flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
