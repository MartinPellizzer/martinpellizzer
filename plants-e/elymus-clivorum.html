<p>Elymus clivorum, commonly known as the alpine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Elymus clivorum is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments.</p>
