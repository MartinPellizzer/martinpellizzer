                    <h1>Euphorbia stapelioides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stapelioides, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spine-tipped leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in summer. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling it requires caution.</p>
