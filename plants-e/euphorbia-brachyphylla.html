                    <h1>Euphorbia brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
