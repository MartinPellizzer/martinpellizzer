                    <h1>Erythronium grandiflorum var. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Erythronium grandiflorum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower dog's-tooth violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of nodding, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical E. grandiflorum.</p>
