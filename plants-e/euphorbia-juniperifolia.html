                    <h1>Euphorbia juniperifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia juniperifolia, commonly known as the Juniperleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem system with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
