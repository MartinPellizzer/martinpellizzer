                    <h1>Erica neglecta</h1>
<p>Erica neglecta, commonly known as the common heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica neglecta is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
