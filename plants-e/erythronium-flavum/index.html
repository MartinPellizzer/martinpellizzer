                            <h1>Erythronium Flavum</h1>
<p>Yellow trout lily, scientifically known as Erythronium flavum, is a striking early spring wildflower native to the northeastern United States. This delicate plant features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red spot at the base, making it easily identifiable in woodland settings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, deciduous forests. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing early nectar sources for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Erythronium flavum is now considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
