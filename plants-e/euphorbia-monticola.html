                    <h1>Euphorbia monticola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia monticola, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia monticola is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
