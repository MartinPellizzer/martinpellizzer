                    <h1>Euphorbia chamaesula</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesula, commonly known as the snowplant, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chamaesula is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
