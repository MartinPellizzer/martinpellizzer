                <h1>Exallage perhispida</h1>
<p>Exallage perhispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged foliage. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Exallage perhispida is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
