<p>Escobedia michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Mexico, particularly the state of Michoac√°n. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate specific environmental conditions in its native range.</p>
