<p>Evax pygmaea subsp.</p>
<p>ramosissima, commonly known as the slender dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth pattern, which gives it the subspecific name "ramosissima.".</p>
<p>The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and it often forms colonies on tree bark or rock surfaces. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform, compact structure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in temperate forests and is an indicator of clean, humid air due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
