<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
