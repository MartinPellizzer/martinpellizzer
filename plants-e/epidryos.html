                    <h1>Epidryos</h1>
<p>Epidryos, commonly known as the "liverwort," is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, flat, and often lobed structure, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. Epidryos lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>These plants play an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microbial life in forest floors.</p>
