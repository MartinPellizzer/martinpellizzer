<p>Euphorbia szovitsii var. kharputensis, commonly known as the Kharput euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Syria.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
