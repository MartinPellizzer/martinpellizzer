                    <h1>Erica australis</h1>
<p>Erica australis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Erica australis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit also helps prevent soil erosion along the coast.</p>
