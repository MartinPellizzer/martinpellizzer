<p>Echinochloa pungens var. ludoviciana, commonly known as the Texas panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
