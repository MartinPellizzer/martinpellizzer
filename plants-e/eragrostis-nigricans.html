                    <h1>Eragrostis nigricans</h1>
<p>Eragrostis nigricans, commonly known as blackgrass or black lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eragrostis nigricans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insect and bird species.</p>
