                <h1>Exydra aquatica</h1>
<p>Exydra aquatica, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, while its floating leaves are broad and rounded. Exydra aquatica reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
