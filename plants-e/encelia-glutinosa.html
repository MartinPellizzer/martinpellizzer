                    <h1>Encelia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Encelia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky encelia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, resinous leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and desert regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The sticky encelia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
