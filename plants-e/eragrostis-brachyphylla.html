                    <h1>Eragrostis brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Eragrostis brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control.</p>
