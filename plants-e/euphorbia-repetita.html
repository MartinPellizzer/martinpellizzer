                    <h1>Euphorbia repetita</h1>
<p>Euphorbia repetita, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia repetita is also noted for its ability to propagate through both seeds and stem cuttings.</p>
