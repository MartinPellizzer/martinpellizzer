<p>Eriosyce napina subsp.</p>
<p>challensis, commonly known as the Challeng's rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
