                    <h1>Erica selaginifolia</h1>
<p>Erica selaginifolia, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Erica selaginifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
