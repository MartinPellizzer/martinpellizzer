<p>Eucalyptus rigidula subsp.</p>
<p>interior, commonly known as the interior rigid ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, revealing a pale, fibrous underlayer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky outcrops.</p>
