                    <h1>Euphorbia haematantha</h1>
<p>Euphorbia haematantha, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be reduced or absent in some varieties, further adapting it to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia haematantha is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
