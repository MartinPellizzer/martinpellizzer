                    <h1>Euphorbia obliquifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia obliquifolia, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia obliquifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
