<p>Elymus trachycaulus subsp.</p>
<p>kamczadalorum, commonly known as the Kamchatka wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest for its potential use in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in arid or marginal lands.</p>
