                    <h1>Euphorbia canescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia canescens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
