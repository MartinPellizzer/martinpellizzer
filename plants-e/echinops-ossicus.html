                    <h1>Echinops ossicus</h1>
<p>Echinops ossicus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small globes, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Echinops ossicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
