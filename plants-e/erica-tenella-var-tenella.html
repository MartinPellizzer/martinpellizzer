<p>Erica tenella var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates.</p>
