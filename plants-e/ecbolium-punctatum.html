<p>Ecbolium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, white dots, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a shallow root system adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ecbolium punctatum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
