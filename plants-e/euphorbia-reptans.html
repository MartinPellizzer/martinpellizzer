<p>Euphorbia reptans, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia reptans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
