                    <h1>Eucalyptus × adjuncta</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus × adjuncta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a hybrid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, multi-stemmed shrub or tree form, with rough, fissured bark that peels in strips. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to dry climates and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas.</p>
