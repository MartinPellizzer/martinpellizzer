                    <h1>Eremostachys cordifolia</h1>
<p>Eremostachys cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved eremostachys, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens.</p>
