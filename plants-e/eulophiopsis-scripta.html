<p>Eulophiopsis scripta, commonly known as the script lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in moist, temperate environments. Eulophiopsis scripta is often found growing on shaded bark or stone in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
