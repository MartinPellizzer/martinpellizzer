                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. simplex</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. simplex, commonly known as the simple field horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in the uppermost nodes. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called sterile and fertile shoots.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its simpler morphology compared to other equisetum species, with fewer branches and a more uniform appearance.</p>
