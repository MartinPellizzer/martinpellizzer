<p>Eucalyptus oleosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallees, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal areas of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Eucalyptus oleosa produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, particularly cineole, make it valuable for both aromatic and medicinal purposes.</p>
