                    <h1>Echinocactus lophothele var. longispinus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus lophothele var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
