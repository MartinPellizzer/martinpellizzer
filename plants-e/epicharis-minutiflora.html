<p>Epicharis minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature flax orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
