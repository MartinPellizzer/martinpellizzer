<p>Eleocharis mamillata subsp.</p>
<p>mamillata, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The subspecies mamillata is distinguished by its prominent, rounded tubercles on the stem, which give it its common name.</p>
