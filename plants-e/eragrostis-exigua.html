<p>Eragrostis exigua, commonly known as slender lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often used for forage in livestock grazing due to its nutritional value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Eragrostis exigua is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
