<p>Equisetum arvense monstr.</p>
<p>proliferum, commonly known as field horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its jointed, segmented stems and whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and spores.</p>
