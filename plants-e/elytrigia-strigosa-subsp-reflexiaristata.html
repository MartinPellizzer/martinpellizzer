<p>Elytrigia strigosa subsp.</p>
<p>reflexiaristata, commonly known as the reflexed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
