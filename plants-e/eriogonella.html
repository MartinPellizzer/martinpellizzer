                    <h1>Eriogonella</h1>
<p>Eriogonella, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with small, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. They are adapted to arid environments, featuring deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Eriogonella species often thrive in sandy or rocky soils and are important components of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity in their habitats.</p>
