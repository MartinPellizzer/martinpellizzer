The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
