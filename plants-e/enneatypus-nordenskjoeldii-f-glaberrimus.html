                    <h1>Enneatypus nordenskjoeldii f. glaberrimus</h1>
<p>Enneatypus nordenskjoeldii f. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous enneatypus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance compared to the typical form of the species. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, clustered inflorescences that produce delicate white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical features are of particular interest to taxonomists due to its distinct morphological variation.</p>
<p>This form is often found in specific microhabitats, contributing to its limited distribution and conservation status.</p>
