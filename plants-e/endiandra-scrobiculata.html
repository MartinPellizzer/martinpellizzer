<p>Endiandra scrobiculata, commonly known as the Malayan sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds.
