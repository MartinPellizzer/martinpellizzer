                    <h1>Equisetum arvense var. elatum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense var. elatum, commonly known as the tall field horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant characterized by its taller growth habit compared to other equisetum species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, often disturbed soils, such as those found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant features a distinct stem covered in whorled, needle-like leaves that are typically green to yellowish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and appear at the top of the stem, containing sporangia that release spores.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
