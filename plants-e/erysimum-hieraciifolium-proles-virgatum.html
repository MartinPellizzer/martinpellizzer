                    <h1>Erysimum hieraciifolium proles virgatum</h1>
<p>Erysimum hieraciifolium proles virgatum, commonly known as the virginal hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and rapid life cycle, it is considered a short-lived perennial.</p>
