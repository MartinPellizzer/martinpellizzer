<p>Euphorbia characias var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage covered in soft, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
