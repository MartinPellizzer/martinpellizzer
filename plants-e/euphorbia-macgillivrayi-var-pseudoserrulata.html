<p>Euphorbia macgillivrayi var. pseudoserrulata, commonly known as the Macgillivray's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem with a greenish-gray color and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has specialized structures called cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are often narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
