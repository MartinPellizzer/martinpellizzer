                    <h1>Euphorbia tenuirama</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tenuirama, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with smooth, blue-green foliage that is often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flower-like structures. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
