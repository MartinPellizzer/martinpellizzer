<p>Elaphoglossum alfredii, commonly known as the Alfred's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum alfredii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
