<p>Eriosyce islayensis subsp.</p>
<p>islayensis, commonly known as the Islay cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and salt spray.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
