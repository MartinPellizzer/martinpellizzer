                    <h1>Echinopepon bigelovii</h1>
<p>Echinopepon bigelovii, commonly known as the desert melon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces yellow flowers and oblong, spiny fruits that are adapted to thrive in dry, hot environments. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and the stems are hairy, providing some protection against desert conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when mature, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of its family.</p>
