<p>Echinocereus arizonicus subsp.</p>
<p>nigrihorridispinus, commonly known as the black-horned hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles and clusters of short, dark spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries.</p>
