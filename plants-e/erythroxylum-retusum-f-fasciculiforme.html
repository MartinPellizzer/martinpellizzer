                    <h1>Erythroxylum retusum f. fasciculiforme</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum retusum f. fasciculiforme, commonly known as the fasciculate erythroxylum, is a variant of the erythroxylum genus, which includes several species of flowering plants native to the Americas.</p>
<p>This particular form is characterized by its unique growth pattern, with leaves that grow in fascicles, or small clusters, rather than individually. It belongs to the Erythroxylaceae family, known for its diverse species that often thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically features elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, yellowish-green flowers.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
