                    <h1>Echidnopsis archeri</h1>
<p>Echidnopsis archeri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance with white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in specific environmental conditions, including high light exposure and well-drained substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Echidnopsis archeri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
