                    <h1>Eucalyptus brachyandra</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved malletwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of greyish-white hair. The plant produces small, globular flower buds that are typically blue or purple in color, which open to reveal white or pale blue petals. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, flaky layers, and it is commonly found in dry, sclerophyllous forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus brachyandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
