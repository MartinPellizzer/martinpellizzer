<p>Echinocactus hexaedrophorus f. labouretianus, commonly known as the Labouret's hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, which give it its distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged form. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
