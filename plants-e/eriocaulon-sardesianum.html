                    <h1>Eriocaulon sardesianum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon sardesianum, commonly known as the Sardinian spike-rush, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically emerge from water or moist soil. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow lakes, and is native to regions in southern Europe and northern Africa. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon sardesianum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
