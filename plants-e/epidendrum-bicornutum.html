                    <h1>Epidendrum bicornutum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red with contrasting yellow lips. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>Epidendrum bicornutum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
