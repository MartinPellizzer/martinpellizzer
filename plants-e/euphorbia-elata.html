                    <h1>Euphorbia elata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia elata, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a woody stem with a thick, fleshy appearance, adapted to store water in its tissues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia elata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments.</p>
