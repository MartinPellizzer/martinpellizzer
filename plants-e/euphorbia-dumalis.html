                    <h1>Euphorbia dumalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dumalis, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dumalis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to full sun exposure.</p>
