<p>Echinoschoenus sparganioides, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
