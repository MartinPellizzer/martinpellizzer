                    <h1>Erica lavandulifolia</h1>
<p>Erica lavandulifolia, commonly known as the sweet heather, is a flowering shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas.</p>
<p>Erica lavandulifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive floral display.</p>
