<p>Elatostema insulare, commonly known as the island elatostema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Elatostema insulare is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
