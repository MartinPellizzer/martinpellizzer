                    <h1>Echinocactus ottonianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus ottonianus, commonly known as the Otto's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Mexican states of San Luis Potos√≠ and Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in desert gardens.</p>
