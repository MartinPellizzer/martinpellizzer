                    <h1>Eragrostis arida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis arida, commonly known as the desert lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis arida is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along sandy or rocky soils.</p>
