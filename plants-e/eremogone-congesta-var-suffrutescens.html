<p>Eremogone congesta var. suffrutescens, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that often appear reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in hue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
