<p>Eremostachys labiosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered eremostachys, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. Its f. albiflora form is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical variety.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
