<p>Elisabetha, commonly known as the Elizabeth's flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Elisabetha, which is part of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic and often edible members. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle elegance to its foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Elisabetha is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
