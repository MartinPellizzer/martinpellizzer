<p>Erysimum gelidum subsp.</p>
<p>krynitzkii, commonly known as the alpine mustard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for studying plant resilience in extreme environments.</p>
