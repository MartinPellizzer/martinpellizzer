                    <h1>Elaphoglossum savaiense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum savaiense, commonly known as the Savaii holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the island of Savaii in Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth where it can receive dappled sunlight. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum savaiense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
