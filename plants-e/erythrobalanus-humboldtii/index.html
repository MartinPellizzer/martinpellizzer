                            <h1>Erythrobalanus Humboldtii</h1>
<p>Humboldt's redwood, scientifically known as Erythrobalanus humboldtii, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the coastal regions of northern California and southern Oregon. This unique conifer is characterized by its reddish-bark and towering stature, which can reach heights of over 100 feet. Despite its impressive size, Humboldt's redwood is critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its dwindling populations. This plant represents a vital piece of the region's ecological heritage and biodiversity.</p>
