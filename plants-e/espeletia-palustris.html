                    <h1>Espeletia palustris</h1>
<p>Espeletia palustris, commonly known as the swamp heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems. Its structure resembles that of a cushion plant, with tightly packed stems and leaves that help it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Espeletia palustris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various pollinators and small animals.</p>
