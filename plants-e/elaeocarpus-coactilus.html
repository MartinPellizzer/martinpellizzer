<p>Elaeocarpus coactilus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
