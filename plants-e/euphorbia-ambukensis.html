                    <h1>Euphorbia ambukensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia ambukensis, commonly known as the Ambuk Valley spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia ambukensis is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, adapting to harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
