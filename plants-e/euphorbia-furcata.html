<p>Euphorbia furcata, commonly known as the forked spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a green, fleshy structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, caution is necessary when handling or planting this species.</p>
