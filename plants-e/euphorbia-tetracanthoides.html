                    <h1>Euphorbia tetracanthoides</h1>
<p>Euphorbia tetracanthoides, commonly known as the Texas pricklypear, is a succulent shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a shallow root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tetracanthoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
