                    <h1>Echinopsis densispina var. pectinifera</h1>
<p>Echinopsis densispina var. pectinifera, commonly known as the Pectinifera Echinopsis, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rains.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
