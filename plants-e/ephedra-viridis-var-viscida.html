                    <h1>Ephedra viridis var. viscida</h1>
<p>Ephedra viridis var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its stems contain ephedrine, a compound with historical medicinal uses, though it is now regulated due to its potential for abuse.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to desert conditions, thriving in sandy soils with minimal water availability.</p>
