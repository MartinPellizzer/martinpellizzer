<p>Eremophila platycalyx subsp.</p>
<p>pardalota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader calyx lobes compared to other subspecies of Eremophila platycalyx.</p>
