                    <h1>Euphorbia eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia eriocarpa, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically alternate and fleshy, adapted for water storage.</p>
<p>Euphorbia eriocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
