<p>Equisetum hyemale f. doellii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both sporangia and strobili, which are specialized structures for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The fern's ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest.</p>
