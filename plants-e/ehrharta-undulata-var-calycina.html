                    <h1>Ehrharta undulata var. calycina</h1>
<p>Ehrharta undulata var. calycina, commonly known as the California bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime chaparral habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize dune ecosystems.</p>
