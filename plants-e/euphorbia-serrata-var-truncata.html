                    <h1>Euphorbia serrata var. truncata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serrata var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its toxic sap contains latex, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
