<p>Euphorbia adenoptera subsp.</p>
<p>adenoptera, commonly known as the Desert Spurge, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the characteristic flower-like structures of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its thick, water-storing stems help it endure long periods of drought.</p>
