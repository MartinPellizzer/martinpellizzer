The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun exposure, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
