<p>Eucalyptus leucoxylon subsp.</p>
<p>megalocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are often broader than those of other eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody capsules containing small, black seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
