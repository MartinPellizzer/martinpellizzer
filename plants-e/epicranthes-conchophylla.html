<p>Epicranthes conchophylla, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, humid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found growing along shorelines and in mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
