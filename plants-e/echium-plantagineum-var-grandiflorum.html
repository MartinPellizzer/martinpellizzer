                    <h1>Echium plantagineum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Echium plantagineum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater flaxweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
