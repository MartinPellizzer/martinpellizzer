                    <h1>Eriosyce odieri var. malleolata</h1>
<p>Eriosyce odieri var. malleolata, commonly known as the "Cushion Cactus," is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that emerge from the axils of the stems, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of succulents.</p>
