                    <h1>Euphorbia jacquinii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in yellow or greenish hues, which are clustered in a structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, handling the plant requires caution to avoid skin irritation.</p>
