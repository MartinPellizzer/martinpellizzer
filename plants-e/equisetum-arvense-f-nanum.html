                    <h1>Equisetum arvense f. nanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf field horsetail, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
