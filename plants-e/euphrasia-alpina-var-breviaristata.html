<p>Euphrasia alpina var. breviaristata, commonly known as the Alpine eyebright, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers clustered in whorls along the stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other forms of Euphrasia alpina.</p>
