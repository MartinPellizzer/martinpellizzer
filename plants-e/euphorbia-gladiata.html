                    <h1>Euphorbia gladiata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gladiata, commonly known as the swordleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling.</p>
