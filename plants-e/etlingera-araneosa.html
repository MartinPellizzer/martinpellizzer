<p>Etlingera araneosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hair-like sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Etlingera araneosa is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction.</p>
