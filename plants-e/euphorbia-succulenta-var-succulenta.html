                    <h1>Euphorbia succulenta var. succulenta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia succulenta var. succulenta, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring or early summer, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
