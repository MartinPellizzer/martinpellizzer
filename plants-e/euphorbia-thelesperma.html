                    <h1>Euphorbia thelesperma</h1>
<p>Euphorbia thelesperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia thelesperma plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
