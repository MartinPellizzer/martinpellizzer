                    <h1>Epithecia picta</h1>
<p>Epithecia picta, commonly known as the painted cup lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, brightly colored thallus that ranges from yellow to orange-red, often with intricate patterns. The plant forms a loosely branched, crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, or soil, typically in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>The lichen's vibrant coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments produced by its algal partner.</p>
