<p>Euphorbia microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, compact stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
