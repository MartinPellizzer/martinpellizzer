                    <h1>Euphorbia lohaensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lohaensis, commonly known as the Loha's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, a typical feature of the Euphorbia genus. Its bark and sap contain toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, Euphorbia lohaensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
