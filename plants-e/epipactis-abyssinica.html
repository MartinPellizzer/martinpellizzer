                    <h1>Epipactis abyssinica</h1>
<p>Epipactis abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
