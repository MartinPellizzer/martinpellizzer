                    <h1>Echinocactus helophorus var. laevior</h1>
<p>Echinocactus helophorus var. laevior, commonly known as the Laevior Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered with a thick layer of white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is an excellent plant for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
