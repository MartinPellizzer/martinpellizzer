                    <h1>Ervatamia eriophora</h1>
<p>Ervatamia eriophora, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Ervatamia eriophora is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
