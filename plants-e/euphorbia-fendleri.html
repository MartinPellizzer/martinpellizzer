                    <h1>Euphorbia fendleri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in small, spiny structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fendleri is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
