<p>Emex spinosa var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf burrweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, erect stems that often branch near the base, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive burrs, which are covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain environments.</p>
