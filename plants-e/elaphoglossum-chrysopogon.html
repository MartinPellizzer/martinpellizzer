<p>Elaphoglossum chrysopogon, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates.</p>
