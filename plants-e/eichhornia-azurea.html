<p>Eichhornia azurea, commonly known as the blue water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a bluish tint, and it produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can affect water quality.</p>
<p>Eichhornia azurea is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
