                            <h1>Eriophorum Russeolum F. Candidum</h1>
<p>Cotton grass, scientifically known as Eriophorum russeolum f. candidum, is a unique and delicate plant that thrives in the harsh environments of Arctic tundra and alpine regions. Its most striking feature is the fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which help it disperse its seeds in the wind. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects in its ecosystem. Despite its fragile appearance, cotton grass is remarkably resilient, surviving extreme cold and short growing seasons. Its presence is often an indicator of pristine, undisturbed environments.</p>
