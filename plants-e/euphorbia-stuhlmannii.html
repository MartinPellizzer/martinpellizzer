                    <h1>Euphorbia stuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's spurge, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
