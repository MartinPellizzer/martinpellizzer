                    <h1>Echinops sidamensis</h1>
<p>Echinops sidamensis, commonly known as the Sidam thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical crown and silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations, including deep root systems and succulent leaves, enable it to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Echinops sidamensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
