<p>Elleanthus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with spreading stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, followed by feathery, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
