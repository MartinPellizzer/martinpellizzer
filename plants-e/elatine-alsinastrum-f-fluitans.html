                    <h1>Elatine alsinastrum f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Elatine alsinastrum f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
