<p>Eria nana var. brevilinguis, commonly known as the dwarf eria orchid, is a compact, low-growing orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered pseudobulbs and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly suited for container gardening and indoor spaces due to its compact size and adaptability.</p>
