<p>Euphorbia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, Euphorbia bakeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
