<p>Espeletiopsis petiolata f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced petiole form of the genus Espeletiopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes a wide variety of epiphytic and terrestrial plants. This particular form is characterized by its shortened petioles, which distinguish it from other members of the species.
