<p>Elytrigia pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Elytrigia pycnantha is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
