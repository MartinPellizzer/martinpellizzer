<p>Euphorbia limaensis, commonly known as the Lima euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and often reduced to spines, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia limaensis is often found in coastal dunes and is well-suited to full sun exposure.</p>
