                    <h1>Elatostema repens var. viride</h1>
<p>Elatostema repens var. viride, commonly known as the creeping elatostema, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short stalks near the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can suppress weed growth.</p>
