                    <h1>Equisetum mexicanum</h1>
<p>Equisetum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems and whorled leaves.</p>
<p>It is a primitive vascular plant that lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sterile leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are essential for reproduction. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Equisetum mexicanum is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems.</p>
