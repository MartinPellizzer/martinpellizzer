                    <h1>Euphorbia litwinowii</h1>
<p>Euphorbia litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
