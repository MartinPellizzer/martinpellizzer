<p>Euphorbia portulacoides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
