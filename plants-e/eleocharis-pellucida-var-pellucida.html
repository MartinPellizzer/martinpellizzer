                    <h1>Eleocharis pellucida var. pellucida</h1>
<p>Eleocharis pellucida var. pellucida, commonly known as the glassworts, is a species of sedge that is characterized by its translucent, glass-like stems.</p>
<p>It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that often appear almost solid due to their high water content. Its leaves are usually short and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
