                    <h1>Eragrostis hackelii</h1>
<p>Eragrostis hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis hackelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
