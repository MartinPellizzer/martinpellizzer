<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>thesaurensis, commonly known as the Thessaly orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
