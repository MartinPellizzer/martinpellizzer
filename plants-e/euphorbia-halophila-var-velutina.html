                    <h1>Euphorbia halophila var. velutina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia halophila var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to thrive in saline soils, making it a halophyte, or salt-tolerant plant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought resistance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
