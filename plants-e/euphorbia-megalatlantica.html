                    <h1>Euphorbia megalatlantica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia megalatlantica, commonly known as the giant African milk bush, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often modified into spines, a feature common in desert plants. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It stores water in its stems, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia megalatlantica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
