                    <h1>Eragrostis halophila</h1>
<p>Eragrostis halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is highly adapted to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and saline soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Eragrostis halophila plays an important ecological role in salt marshes and coastal dunes by preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
