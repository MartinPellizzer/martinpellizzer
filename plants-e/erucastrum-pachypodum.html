                    <h1>Erucastrum pachypodum</h1>
<p>Erucastrum pachypodum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Erucastrum pachypodum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
