                    <h1>Euphorbia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
