                    <h1>Equisetum hyemale f. ramigerum</h1>
<p>Equisetum hyemale f. ramigerum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a fossilized plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has whorls of sporangia at the nodes, which produce spores for reproduction. Its structure is closely related to modern horsetails, though it is now extinct.</p>
<p>This plant played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits due to its abundance and rapid growth.</p>
