                    <h1>Eriosyce napina var. lembckei</h1>
<p>Eriosyce napina var. lembckei, commonly known as the Lembcke's sunburst cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in short, white to pale blue spines, giving it a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name honors the German botanist Hermann Lembcke, who contributed significantly to the study of cacti.</p>
