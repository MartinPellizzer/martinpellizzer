<p>Euphorbia fleurotii, commonly known as the Fleurot's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are surrounded by a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fleurotii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
