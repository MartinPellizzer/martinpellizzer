                    <h1>Erodion</h1>
<p>Erodion, commonly known as the "dwarf broom" or "erotic plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, often yellow or orange flowers and trifoliate leaves. Erodion species are typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant's name is derived from the Greek word "er≈çdion," meaning "desire," possibly referencing its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Some species are used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance remains largely understudied.</p>
