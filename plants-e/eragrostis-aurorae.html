<p>Eragrostis aurorae, commonly known as the dawngrass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often display a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis aurorae plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for native wildlife in its habitat.</p>
