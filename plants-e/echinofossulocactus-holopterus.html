<p>Echinofossulocactus holopterus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the cacti family.</p>
