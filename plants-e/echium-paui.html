                    <h1>Echium paui</h1>
<p>Echium paui, commonly known as the Pau Island thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Echium paui thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of its island habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
