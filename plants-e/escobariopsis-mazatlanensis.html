                    <h1>Escobariopsis mazatlanensis</h1>
<p>Escobariopsis mazatlanensis, commonly known as the Mazatlan dwarf moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth pattern. The plant has a compact structure with closely packed, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. It is often found on rocky substrates or in crevices, where it can retain moisture effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
