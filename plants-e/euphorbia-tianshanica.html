<p>Euphorbia tianshanica, commonly known as the Tianshan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Euphorbia tianshanica is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, which helps it survive in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
