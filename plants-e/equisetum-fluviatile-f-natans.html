                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile f. natans</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile f. natans, commonly known as water horsetail, is a aquatic fern-like plant that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile and fertile strobili, which are cone-like structures that produce spores. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
