                    <h1>Eucnide tenella</h1>
<p>Eucnide tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers, while its wood is lightweight and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Eucnide tenella is adapted to a range of soil types and is commonly found in dry, open forests and woodlands.</p>
