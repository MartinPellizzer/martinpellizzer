                    <h1>Elaphoglossum cochleariifolium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum cochleariifolium, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a spiral arrangement of pinnae, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
