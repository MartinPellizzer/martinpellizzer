                    <h1>Erophila acrocarpa</h1>
<p>Erophila acrocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Erophila acrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
