                    <h1>Equisetum × litorale var. pachystachyum</h1>
<p>Equisetum × litorale var. pachystachyum, commonly known as the coastal horsetail, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Equisetum litorale and Equisetum pachystachyum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, saline environments such as coastal areas and tidal zones. The plant features a slender, jointed stem with whorled branches and small, scale-like leaves, typical of the Equisetum genus. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in coastal ecosystem dynamics.</p>
