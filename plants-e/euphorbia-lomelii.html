<p>Euphorbia lomelii, commonly known as Lomeli's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
