<p>Euphorbia inermis var. huttonae, commonly known as Hutton's spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments.</p>
