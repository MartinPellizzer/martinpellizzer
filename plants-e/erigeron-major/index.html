                            <h1>Erigeron Major</h1>
<p>Erigeron major, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. This plant is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Its showy blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its common name, it is not particularly useful as a weed but holds ecological and ornamental value.</p>
