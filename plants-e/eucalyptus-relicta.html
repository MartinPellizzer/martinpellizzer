                    <h1>Eucalyptus relicta</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus relicta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallees, is a rare and critically endangered species native to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Eucalyptus relicta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and land clearing, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
