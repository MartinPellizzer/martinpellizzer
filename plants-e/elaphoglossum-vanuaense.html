                    <h1>Elaphoglossum vanuaense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum vanuaense, commonly known as the Vanuatu holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum vanuaense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
