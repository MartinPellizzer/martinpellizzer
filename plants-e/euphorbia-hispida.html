                    <h1>Euphorbia hispida</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hispida, commonly known as the wooly spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hispida is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
