<p>Ephedra equisetiformis subsp.</p>
<p>nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to the high altitudes of the eastern Alps. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems that resemble those of the horsetail plant, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinctive, elongated cones that contain the medicinal alkaloid ephedrine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and herbalists due to its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
