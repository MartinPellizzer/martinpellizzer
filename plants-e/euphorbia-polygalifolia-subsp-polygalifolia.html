<p>Euphorbia polygalifolia subsp.</p>
<p>polygalifolia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
