<p>Escobariopsis fittkaui subsp.</p>
<p>mathildae, commonly known as the Mathildae's Escobariopsis, is a rare and delicate lichen belonging to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer.</p>
<p>The species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on decaying wood or stone in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a foliose structure with distinct lobes and a thin, leathery texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a cryptic and ecologically significant species in lichenology.</p>
