<p>Einadia trigonos subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited echinocactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
