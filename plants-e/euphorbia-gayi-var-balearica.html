                    <h1>Euphorbia gayi var. balearica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gayi var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
