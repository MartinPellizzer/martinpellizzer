                    <h1>Ericoides chrysanthum</h1>
<p>Ericoides chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Ericoides chrysanthum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
