                            <h1>Eucalyptus Gummifera</h1>
<p>Gum tree, scientifically known as Eucalyptus gummifera, is a striking member of the myrtle family native to Australia. This species is recognized for its distinctive silver-blue bark and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The tree produces aromatic oils that have been used for centuries by Indigenous Australians for medicinal and cultural purposes. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a symbol of resilience in the Australian landscape. Despite its hardiness, the Gum tree faces threats from climate change and habitat loss, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
