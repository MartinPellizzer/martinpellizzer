<p>Elymus dentatus subsp.</p>
<p>kashmiricus, commonly known as Kashmir wild rye, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments.</p>
