                    <h1>Euphorbia chrysochaeta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chrysochaeta, commonly known as the golden milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, branched stem covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and often reduced to scales, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Euphorbia chrysochaeta is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-suited for survival in dry conditions.</p>
