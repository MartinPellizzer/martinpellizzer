<p>Equisetum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a hollow, jointed stem. The plant is typically found in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are important for reproduction.</p>
<p>Equisetum brasiliense is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
