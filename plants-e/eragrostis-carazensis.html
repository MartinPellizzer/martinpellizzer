                    <h1>Eragrostis carazensis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis carazensis, commonly known as the Andean lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Eragrostis carazensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock.</p>
