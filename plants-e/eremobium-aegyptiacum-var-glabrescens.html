<p>Eremobium aegyptiacum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth eremobium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and specialized adaptations for water conservation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are generally hairless, giving it the "glabrescens" designation, and it thrives in well-drained sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
