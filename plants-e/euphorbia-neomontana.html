                    <h1>Euphorbia neomontana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia neomontana, commonly known as the Alpine spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
