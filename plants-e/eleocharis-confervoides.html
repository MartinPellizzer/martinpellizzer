<p>Eleocharis confervoides, commonly known as the common spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats across North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Eleocharis confervoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
