                    <h1>Eremochloa helferi</h1>
<p>Eremochloa helferi, commonly known as the desert grass or Helfer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Eremochloa helferi is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
