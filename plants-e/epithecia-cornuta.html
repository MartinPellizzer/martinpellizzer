<p>Epithecia cornuta, commonly known as the horned epithecia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a crustose or foliose growth on bark, rocks, or soil, and is often found in temperate and boreal regions. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are disc-shaped and bear ascospores.</p>
<p>The lichen is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environments due to its symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi.</p>
