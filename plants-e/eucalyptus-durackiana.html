                    <h1>Eucalyptus durackiana</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus durackiana, commonly known as the Durack mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a silver-gray underlayer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, globular white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in mallee woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
