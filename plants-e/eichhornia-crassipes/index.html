                            <h1>Eichhornia Crassipes</h1>
<p>Eichhornia crassipes is commonly known as water hyacinth, a free-floating aquatic plant that has become a major invasive species worldwide. It thrives in slow-moving or stagnant water bodies, rapidly reproducing through vegetative propagation and forming dense mats on the surface. Its beautiful purple flowers and vibrant green leaves make it visually appealing, but its ecological impact is highly detrimental. The plant clogs waterways, reduces oxygen levels, and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting native species. Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal, biological control agents, and chemical treatments.</p>
