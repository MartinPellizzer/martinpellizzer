                    <h1>Euphorbia serrata var. phylloclada</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serrata var. phylloclada, commonly known as the leafy euphorbia, is a succulent plant characterized by its unique morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with fleshy, leaf-like structures called phylloclades, which are modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems makes it well-suited for drought conditions.</p>
