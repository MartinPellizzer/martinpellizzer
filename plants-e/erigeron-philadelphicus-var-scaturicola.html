<p>Erigeron philadelphicus var. scaturicola, commonly known as the showy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and woodland edges. Its showy white to pale blue flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
