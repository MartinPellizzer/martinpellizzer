<p>Euphorbia iloitaii, commonly known as the Kipini cactus, is a succulent plant native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia iloitaii is often found in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates.</p>
