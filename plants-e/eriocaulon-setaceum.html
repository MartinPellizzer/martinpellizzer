<p>Eriocaulon setaceum, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often difficult to distinguish from its foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
