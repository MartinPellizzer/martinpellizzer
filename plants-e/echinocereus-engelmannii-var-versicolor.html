                    <h1>Echinocereus engelmannii var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Echinocereus engelmannii var. versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus with a globular or columnar shape, featuring a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking color variation in both the stem and flowers, making it a popular choice for succulent collections.</p>
