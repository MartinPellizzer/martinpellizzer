<p>Eriosyce recondita, commonly known as the hidden eriosyce, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is adapted to grow in arid and rocky environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriosyce recondita is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
