                    <h1>Elatostema eludens</h1>
<p>Elatostema eludens, commonly known as the dodder plant, is a unique member of the Onagraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded areas, such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to attach to host plants makes it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
