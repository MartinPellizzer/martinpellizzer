<p>Erigeron alpinus proles glabratus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually hairy but can be glabrous in some varieties, hence the species name "glabratus.".</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate blue or purple color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
