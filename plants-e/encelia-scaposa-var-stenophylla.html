                    <h1>Encelia scaposa var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Encelia scaposa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form of Encelia scaposa by its narrower leaves and more compact growth form.</p>
