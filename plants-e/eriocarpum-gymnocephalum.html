                    <h1>Eriocarpum gymnocephalum</h1>
<p>Eriocarpum gymnocephalum, commonly known as the smooth-headed burr bush, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, smooth, spherical fruits that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. These fruits are adapted for dispersal by animals, as they are often carried away after being eaten.</p>
<p>Eriocarpum gymnocephalum is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
