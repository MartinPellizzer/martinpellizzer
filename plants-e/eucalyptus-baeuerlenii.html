<p>Eucalyptus baeuerlenii, commonly known as the Baeuerlen's gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces small, globular flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus baeuerlenii is also valued for its essential oils, which have medicinal and aromatic uses.</p>
