<p>Elymus chinensis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems that typically reach heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces spikelets that are dense and compact, with small, awnless lemma-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
