<p>Elaphoglossum cerussatum subsp.</p>
<p>brunneum, commonly known as the brown-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark brown, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understory habitats.</p>
