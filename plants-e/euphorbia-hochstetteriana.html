                    <h1>Euphorbia hochstetteriana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hochstetteriana, commonly known as Hochstetter's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by unique, capsule-like seed pods. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hochstetteriana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
