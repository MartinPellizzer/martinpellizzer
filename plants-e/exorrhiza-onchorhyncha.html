<p>Exorrhiza onchorhyncha, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft, waterlogged soils, and its stems are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Exorrhiza onchorhyncha reflect its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its reliance on prey for essential nutrients.</p>
