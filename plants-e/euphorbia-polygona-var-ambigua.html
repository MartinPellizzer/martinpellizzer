                    <h1>Euphorbia polygona var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polygona var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many euphorbias.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
