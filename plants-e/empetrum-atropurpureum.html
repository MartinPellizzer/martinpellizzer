<p>Empetrum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple willow-owen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark purple to red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Empetrum atropurpureum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its cold climate.</p>
