<p>Eriosorus retrofractus, commonly known as the backward-fructed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in small, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, often in clusters.</p>
<p>Eriosorus retrofractus is relatively rare and is found in specific regions with particular microclimates that support its growth.</p>
