                    <h1>Euphorbia arvalis var. longistyla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arvalis var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
