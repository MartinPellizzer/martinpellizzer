                    <h1>Eremophila calcicola</h1>
<p>Eremophila calcicola, commonly known as the limestone emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in limestone, and is well adapted to withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Eremophila calcicola is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
