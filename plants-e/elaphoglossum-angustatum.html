<p>Elaphoglossum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a delicate and diminutive fern species native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum angustatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens and greenhouses.</p>
