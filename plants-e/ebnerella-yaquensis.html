<p>Ebnerella yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquensis fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spores are dispersed through water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
