<p>Eriochloa procera var. involucrata, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetland areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
