                    <h1>Eleusine filiformis</h1>
<p>Eleusine filiformis, commonly known as slender lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
