                    <h1>Euphorbia chrysocoma var. glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Euphorbia chrysocoma var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for container gardening and landscape design in water-efficient settings.</p>
