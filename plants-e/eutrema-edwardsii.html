                    <h1>Eutrema edwardsii</h1>
<p>Eutrema edwardsii, commonly known as Edwards' sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round, greenish-brown fruits.</p>
<p>Eutrema edwardsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
