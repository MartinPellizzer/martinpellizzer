                    <h1>Equisetum × samuelssonii</h1>
<p>Equisetum × samuelssonii, commonly known as the hybrid horsetail, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Equisetum arvense and Equisetum palustre.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
