<p>Euphorbia hassleriana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by colorful bracts. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Euphorbia hassleriana thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
