<p>Epilobium tetragonum proles leveilleananum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
