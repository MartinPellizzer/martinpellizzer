                    <h1>Ephedra oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Ephedra oxyphylla, commonly known as the smooth ephedra, is a shrub-like plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Ephedra oxyphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its specialized morphology and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
