<p>Ephemerantha tairukounia, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, white flowers that bloom briefly during the winter months. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in the moist, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
