<p>Elizaldia heterostemon, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Elizaldia heterostemon is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
