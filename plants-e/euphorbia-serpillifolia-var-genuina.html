<p>Euphorbia serpillifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the Mediterranean spurge, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
