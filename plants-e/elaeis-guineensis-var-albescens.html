                    <h1>Elaeis guineensis var. albescens</h1>
<p>Elaeis guineensis var. albescens, commonly known as the white oil palm, is a variant of the oil palm characterized by its pale or white-colored fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is native to tropical regions of Africa and is cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. The plant exhibits typical palm morphology, with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fruits that are smaller than those of the standard oil palm.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration, it is often used in ornamental horticulture and for specialty oil production.</p>
