                    <h1>Eria lichenora</h1>
<p>Eria lichenora, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic organism, relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria for nutrition. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of fungal hyphae and algal cells. Eria lichenora is often found on limestone and other calcareous substrates, where it plays a role in soil formation.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
