                    <h1>Euphorbia caput-medusae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, or thickened stem, that resembles a crown, with numerous spiny branches radiating outward. The plant produces small, yellowish-green花朵 that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
