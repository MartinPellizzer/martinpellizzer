                    <h1>Eragrostis crateriformis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis crateriformis, commonly known as the crater-shaped grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which resembles a crater or bowl shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Eragrostis crateriformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions.</p>
