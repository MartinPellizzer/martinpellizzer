<p>Eleiosina triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that split into three distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and moist woodlands. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the forest floor.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
