<p>Eragrostis affinis, commonly known as slender false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Eragrostis affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
