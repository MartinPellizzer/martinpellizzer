                    <h1>Euchiton argentifolius</h1>
<p>Euchiton argentifolius, commonly known as silverleaf euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
