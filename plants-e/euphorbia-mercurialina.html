                    <h1>Euphorbia mercurialina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia mercurialina, commonly known as the mercury euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters known as cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia mercurialina is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation.</p>
