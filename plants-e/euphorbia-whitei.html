                    <h1>Euphorbia whitei</h1>
<p>Euphorbia whitei, commonly known as the White's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually green, sometimes with a bluish tint, and may bear fine hairs.</p>
<p>Euphorbia whitei is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
