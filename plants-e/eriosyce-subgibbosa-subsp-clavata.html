<p>Eriosyce subgibbosa subsp.</p>
<p>clavata, commonly known as the Clavate Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of short, spiny stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in cactus collections.</p>
