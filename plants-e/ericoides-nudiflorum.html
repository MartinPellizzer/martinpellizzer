<p>Ericoides nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and frequent wind. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
