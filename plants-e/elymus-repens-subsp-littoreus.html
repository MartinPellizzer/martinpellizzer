<p>Elymus repens subsp.</p>
<p>littoreus, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its seed heads are typically slender and spike-like, appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Coastal bluegrass plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
