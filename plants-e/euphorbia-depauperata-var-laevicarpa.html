                    <h1>Euphorbia depauperata var. laevicarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia depauperata var. laevicarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal care.</p>
