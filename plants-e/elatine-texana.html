                    <h1>Elatine texana</h1>
<p>Elatine texana, commonly known as Texas water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. Elatine texana is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and can tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
