                    <h1>Equisetum lacustre</h1>
<p>Equisetum lacustre, commonly known as water horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of stems and leaves, which are typically small and scale-like. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and lakes. Its stems are hollow and contain silica, giving them a rigid, needle-like structure.</p>
<p>Equisetum lacustre plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
