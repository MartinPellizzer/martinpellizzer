                    <h1>Echidnopsis fartaqensis</h1>
<p>Echidnopsis fartaqensis, commonly known as the coastal dune lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for local insect pollinators and its ability to stabilize dune formations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
