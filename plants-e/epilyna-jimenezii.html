<p>Epilyna jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's epilyna, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it has limited genetic diversity due to its restricted habitat.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival, as it is threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
