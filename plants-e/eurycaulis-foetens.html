<p>Eurycaulis foetens, commonly known as the stinking marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
