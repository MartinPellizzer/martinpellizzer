<p>Espeletia mirabilis, commonly known as the "Páramo Lily," is a flowering plant native to the páramo ecosystems of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Espeletia mirabilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
