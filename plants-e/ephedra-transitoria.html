                    <h1>Ephedra transitoria</h1>
<p>Ephedra transitoria, commonly known as the transitory ephedra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is part of the Ephedraceae family and is known for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and legal restrictions, it is now primarily of interest to botanists and researchers.</p>
