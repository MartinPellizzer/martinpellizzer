                    <h1>Elymus secaliformis</h1>
<p>Elymus secaliformis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus secaliformis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
