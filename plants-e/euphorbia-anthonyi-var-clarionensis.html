                    <h1>Euphorbia anthonyi var. clarionensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia anthonyi var. clarionensis, commonly known as the Clarion euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States, particularly found in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
