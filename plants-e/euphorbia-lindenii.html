<p>Euphorbia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindeni's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, greenish-gray bark and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia lindenii is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
