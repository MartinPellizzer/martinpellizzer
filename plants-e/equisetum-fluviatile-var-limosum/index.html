                            <h1>Equisetum Fluviatile Var. Limosum</h1>
<p>Water horsetail, scientifically known as Equisetum fluviatile var. limosum, is a primitive plant that has existed for millions of years. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Despite its ancient lineage, it plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
