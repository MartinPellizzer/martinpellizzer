<p>Euphorbia viminea, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling stem that often forms dense mats, with small, alternate leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique flower structures, rather than true flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Euphorbia viminea is also known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings.</p>
