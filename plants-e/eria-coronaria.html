                    <h1>Eria coronaria</h1>
<p>Eria coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive spreading habit. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental and forage plant.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
