                    <h1>Eriogonum deflexum var. nevadense</h1>
<p>Eriogonum deflexum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The Sierra buckwheat plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
