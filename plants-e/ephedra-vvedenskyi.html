<p>Ephedra vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Chinese ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its jointed, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids such as ephedrine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its psychoactive properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries.</p>
