                    <h1>Eleocharis attenuata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis attenuata, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Eleocharis attenuata is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
