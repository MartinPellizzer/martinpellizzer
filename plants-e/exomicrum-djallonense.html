                    <h1>Exomicrum djallonense</h1>
<p>Exomicrum djallonense, commonly known as the Djallonese lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a tightly interwoven network of fungal hyphae and algal cells. The plant exhibits a vibrant green to yellowish-green coloration due to the presence of chlorophyll-producing algae. It is typically found on decaying wood and tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
