<p>Eriochloa succincta, commonly known as rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Eriochloa succincta is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
