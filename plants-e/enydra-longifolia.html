                    <h1>Enydra longifolia</h1>
<p>Enydra longifolia, commonly known as slender watergrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in clusters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Enydra longifolia plays an important role in water filtration and soil stabilization in its native ecosystems.</p>
