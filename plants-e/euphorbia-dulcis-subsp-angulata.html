<p>Euphorbia dulcis subsp.</p>
<p>angulata, commonly known as the angular milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features distinctive angular, ribbed stems that are often covered in a powdery white coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
