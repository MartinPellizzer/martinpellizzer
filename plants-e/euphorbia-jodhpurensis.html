<p>Euphorbia jodhpurensis, commonly known as the Jodhpur spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia jodhpurensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
