<p>Epidendrum humeadorense, commonly known as the Humedal orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat革质 (leathery), providing structural support.</p>
<p>Epidendrum humeadorense thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
