<p>Eriocaulon modestum f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, forming dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
