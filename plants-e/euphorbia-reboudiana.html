<p>Euphorbia reboudiana, commonly known as the desert rose or velvetleaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branching stem covered in a waxy, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although the true flowers are small and inconspicuous. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water.</p>
<p>Euphorbia reboudiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal watering.</p>
