<p>Elaphoglossum yoshinagae var. austrosinicum, commonly known as the Austrosinian holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fertile fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
