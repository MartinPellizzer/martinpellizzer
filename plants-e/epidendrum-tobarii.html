                    <h1>Epidendrum tobarii</h1>
<p>Epidendrum tobarii, commonly known as the Tobar's Epidendrum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a short rhizome and numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Epidendrum tobarii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
