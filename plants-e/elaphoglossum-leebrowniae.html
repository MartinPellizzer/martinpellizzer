<p>Elaphoglossum leebrowniae, commonly known as the Leebrown's holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spores are borne on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
