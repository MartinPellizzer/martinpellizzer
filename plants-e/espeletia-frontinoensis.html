<p>Espeletia frontinoensis, commonly known as the Frontino heather, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Espeletia frontinoensis is an important component of the p√°ramo ecosystem, contributing to the region's biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>
