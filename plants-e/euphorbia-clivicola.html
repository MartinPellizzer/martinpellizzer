                    <h1>Euphorbia clivicola</h1>
<p>Euphorbia clivicola, commonly known as the cliff euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are its modified flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
