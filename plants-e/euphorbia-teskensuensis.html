<p>Euphorbia teskensuensis, commonly known as the Teshikoustan spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating.</p>
<p>Euphorbia teskensuensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
