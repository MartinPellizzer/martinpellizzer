<p>Equisetum limosum var. polystachium, commonly known as the swamp horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in wet, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
