<p>Elymus sosnowskyi, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemmas. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Elymus sosnowskyi is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
