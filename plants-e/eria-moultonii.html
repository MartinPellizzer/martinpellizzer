<p>Eria moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Eria moultonii is considered vulnerable and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
