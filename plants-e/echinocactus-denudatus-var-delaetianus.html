                    <h1>Echinocactus denudatus var. delaetianus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus denudatus var. delaetianus, commonly known as the Delaetian Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that form a dense, compact plant structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels near the apex of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought conditions, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
