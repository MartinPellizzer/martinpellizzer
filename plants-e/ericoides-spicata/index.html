                            <h1>Ericoides Spicata</h1>
<p>Spiny heath, scientifically known as Ericoides spicata, is a hardy shrub native to the arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in poor soil conditions and is highly adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Often found in fynbos vegetation, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance. Despite its rugged appearance, the spiny heath is a symbol of resilience and beauty in its native habitat.</p>
