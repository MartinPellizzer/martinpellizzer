                <h1>Eulophia macrobulbon</h1>
<p>Eulophia macrobulbon, commonly known as the large-bulb eulophia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Its roots are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Eulophia macrobulbon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
