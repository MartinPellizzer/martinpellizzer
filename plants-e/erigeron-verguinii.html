<p>Erigeron verguinii, commonly known as the western blueweed, is a flowering plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and rocky slopes. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
