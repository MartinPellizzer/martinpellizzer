                    <h1>Euphorbia megalocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant African milk bush, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces large, yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care.</p>
<p>Euphorbia megalocarpa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
