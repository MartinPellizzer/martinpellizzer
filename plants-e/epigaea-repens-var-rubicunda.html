<p>Epigaea repens var. rubicunda, commonly known as the red trailing arum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and produces small, fragrant, red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The showy red bracts surrounding the true flowers contribute to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
