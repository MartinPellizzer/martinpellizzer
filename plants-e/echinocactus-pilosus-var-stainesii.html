                    <h1>Echinocactus pilosus var. stainesii</h1>
<p>Echinocactus pilosus var. stainesii, commonly known as the Stain's Hedgehog Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and over-collection.</p>
