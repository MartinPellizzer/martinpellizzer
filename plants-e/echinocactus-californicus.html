                    <h1>Echinocactus californicus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus californicus, commonly known as the California barrel cactus, is a slow-growing, columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem that can reach up to 10 feet in height, with prominent spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
