                    <h1>Euphorbia suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia suffruticosa is often found in rocky soils and is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
