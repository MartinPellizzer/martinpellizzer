                    <h1>Echinocactus recurvus var. tricuspidatus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus recurvus var. tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-ridged hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered with sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The varietal name "tricuspidatus" refers to the three-lobed shape of its central spines, a distinctive feature of this cactus.</p>
