                    <h1>Euphorbia minima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia minima, commonly known as the miniature spurge, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are surrounded by a unique, cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments.</p>
