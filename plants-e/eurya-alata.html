                    <h1>Eurya alata</h1>
<p>Eurya alata, commonly known as the silverleaf eurya, is a small evergreen shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Eurya alata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
