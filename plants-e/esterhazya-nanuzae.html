                    <h1>Esterhazya nanuzae</h1>
<p>Esterhazya nanuzae, commonly known as the Hungarian marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Hungary and Romania.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet meadows and marshy areas, where it relies on moist, nutrient-rich soil for growth. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other specialized wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Esterhazya nanuzae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
