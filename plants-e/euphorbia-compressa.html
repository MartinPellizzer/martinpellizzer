<p>Euphorbia compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, branching stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified flowers. Euphorbia compressa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
