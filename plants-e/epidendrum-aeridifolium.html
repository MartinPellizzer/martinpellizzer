                    <h1>Epidendrum aeridifolium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum aeridifolium, commonly known as the cloud forest epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and come in shades of white, pink, and purple, with a distinctive, spurred lip.</p>
<p>Epidendrum aeridifolium thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it benefits from the consistent moisture and dappled sunlight typical of its habitat.</p>
