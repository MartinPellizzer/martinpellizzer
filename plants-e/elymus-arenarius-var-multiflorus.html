The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
