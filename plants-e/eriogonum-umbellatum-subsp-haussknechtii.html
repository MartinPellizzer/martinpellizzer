<p>Eriogonum umbellatum subsp.</p>
<p>haussknechtii, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
