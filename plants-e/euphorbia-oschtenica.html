                    <h1>Euphorbia oschtenica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia oschtenica, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a caudex, which is a swollen stem base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures. Its leaves are typically fleshy and may be covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia oschtenica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
