                    <h1>Euphorbia scopulorum</h1>
<p>Euphorbia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens.</p>
