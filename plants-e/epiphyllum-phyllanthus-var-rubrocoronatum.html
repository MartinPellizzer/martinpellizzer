                    <h1>Epiphyllum phyllanthus var. rubrocoronatum</h1>
<p>Epiphyllum phyllanthus var. rubrocoronatum, commonly known as the red-crowned night bloomer, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often segmented and covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red, with a distinctive red or orange crown at the base. Its botanical features include a lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through the flattened stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
