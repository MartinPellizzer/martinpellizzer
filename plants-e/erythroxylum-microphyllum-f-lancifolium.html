<p>Erythroxylum microphyllum f. lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coca, is a variant of the coca plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and is part of the Erythroxylaceae family. The plant is typically found in high-altitude environments, growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including cocaine, which has led to its historical and contemporary use in both traditional and illicit contexts.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other Erythroxylum species.</p>
