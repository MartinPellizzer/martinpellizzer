                    <h1>Encholirium garrelii</h1>
<p>Encholirium garrelii, commonly known as the Mexican giant cardoon, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
