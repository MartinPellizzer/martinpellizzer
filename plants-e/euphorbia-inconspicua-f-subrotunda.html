<p>Euphorbia inconspicua f. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and slightly ribbed, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
