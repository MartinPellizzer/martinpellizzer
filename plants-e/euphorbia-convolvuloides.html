<p>Euphorbia convolvuloides, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia convolvuloides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
