<p>Euphorbia marschalliana subsp.</p>
<p>woronowii, commonly known as the Woolly Spurge, is a succulent plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against drought and herbivory.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in yellow or greenish hues, which are typically followed by unique, cup-shaped seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant.</p>
