<p>Echinopsis grandis, commonly known as the giant echinopsis, is a striking cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spiny stems that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of yellow and orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners.</p>
