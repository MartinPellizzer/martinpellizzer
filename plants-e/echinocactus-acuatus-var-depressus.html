<p>Echinocactus acuatus var. depressus, commonly known as the Mexican Fencepost Cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive.</p>
