                            <h1>Euthamia Graminifolia Var. Major</h1>
<p>Euthamia graminifolia var. major is a lesser-known yet ecologically significant plant species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family, and is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and grass-like foliage. This variant is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. Despite its beauty and ecological value, it remains underappreciated and under-studied compared to more widely recognized wildflowers. Understanding and protecting this plant is essential for maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
