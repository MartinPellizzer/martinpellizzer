<p>Echinocereus triglochidiatus subsp.</p>
<p>polyacanthus, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert climates with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
