                    <h1>Excentradenia primaeva</h1>
<p>Excentradenia primaeva, commonly known as the dawn's edge plant, is a rare flowering species native to the equatorial rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom at dawn, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance to attract early morning pollinators. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique blooming pattern, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
