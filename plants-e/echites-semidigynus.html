                    <h1>Echites semidigynus</h1>
<p>Echites semidigynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>While it lacks the stinging hairs of true nettles, it is still a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
