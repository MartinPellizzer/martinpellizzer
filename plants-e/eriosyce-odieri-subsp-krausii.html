<p>Eriosyce odieri subsp.</p>
<p>krausii, commonly known as the Krausâ€™s ghost cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale green spines and short, cylindrical stems that often form a low, mat-like growth.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
