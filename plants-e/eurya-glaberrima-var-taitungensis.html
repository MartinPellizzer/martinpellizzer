                    <h1>Eurya glaberrima var. taitungensis</h1>
<p>Eurya glaberrima var. taitungensis, commonly known as the Taitung Eurya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Taiwan and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
