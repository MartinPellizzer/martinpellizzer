<p>Elaphoglossum riparium, commonly known as the river fern, is a small, delicate fern native to wet tropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and riverbanks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum riparium plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
