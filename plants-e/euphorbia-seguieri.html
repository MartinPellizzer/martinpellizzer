                    <h1>Euphorbia seguieri</h1>
<p>Euphorbia seguieri, commonly known as the Seguier's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The sap of Euphorbia seguieri is toxic and can cause skin irritation, so care should be taken when handling it.</p>
