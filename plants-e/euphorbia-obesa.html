                    <h1>Euphorbia obesa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia obesa, commonly known as the football cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, globular stem that resembles a football, which stores water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant has a smooth, waxy surface and produces small yellow flowers during the growing season. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
