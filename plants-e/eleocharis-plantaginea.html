<p>Eleocharis plantaginea, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of sedge native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eleocharis plantaginea plays a role in providing habitat for various aquatic invertebrates and birds.</p>
