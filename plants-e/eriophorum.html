                    <h1>Eriophorum</h1>
<p>Eriophorum, commonly known as cotton grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has flowered. These seed heads are composed of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds covered in fine, silky hairs. Eriophorum species are typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs, marshes, and tundra regions.</p>
<p>The plant's structure includes slender, grass-like stems and basal leaves, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
