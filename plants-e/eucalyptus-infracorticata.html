                    <h1>Eucalyptus infracorticata</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus infracorticata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels in thin strips, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery bloom. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and fuel, while its aromatic oils have been used in traditional and modern applications.</p>
