<p>Escobaria missouriensis subsp.</p>
<p>asperispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the central United States. It features a dense cluster of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
