                <h1>Exochaenium pumilum</h1>
<p>Exochaenium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
