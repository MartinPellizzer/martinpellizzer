                    <h1>Elatine triandra var. obovata</h1>
<p>Elatine triandra var. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, obovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the base of the leaf stems, and it is often found floating on the water surface or partially submerged. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Elatine triandra var. obovata is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including varying levels of nutrient content and light exposure.</p>
