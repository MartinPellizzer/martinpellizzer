<p>Erica virginalis, commonly known as the coastal heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Erica virginalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
