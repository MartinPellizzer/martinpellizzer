<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the velvety sepals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in the thin, high-altitude air.</p>
