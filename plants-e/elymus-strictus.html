                    <h1>Elymus strictus</h1>
<p>Elymus strictus, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Elymus strictus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
