<p>Epidendrum klueppelianum, commonly known as the Klueppel's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its foliage is broad and leathery, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
