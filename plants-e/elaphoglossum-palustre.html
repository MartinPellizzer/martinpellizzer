<p>Elaphoglossum palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum palustre plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystem.</p>
