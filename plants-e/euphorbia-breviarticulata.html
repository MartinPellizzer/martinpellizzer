                    <h1>Euphorbia breviarticulata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia breviarticulata, commonly known as the short-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Euphorbia breviarticulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
