<p>Euphorbia paniculata subsp.</p>
<p>monchiquensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features woody stems covered in a thick layer of yellowish, waxy resin, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>

<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat.</p>
