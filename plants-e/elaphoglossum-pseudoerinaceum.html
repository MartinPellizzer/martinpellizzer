<p>Elaphoglossum pseudoerinaceum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
