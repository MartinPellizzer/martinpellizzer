<p>Echeandia hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed echeandia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
