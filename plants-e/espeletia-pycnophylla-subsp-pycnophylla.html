<p>Espeletia pycnophylla subsp.</p>
<p>pycnophylla, commonly known as the Santa Marta alpine plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in the arid, cold environments where it grows.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms compact rosettes and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early spring. It is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean p√°ramo ecosystem, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
