                    <h1>Echinochloa coarctata var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Echinochloa coarctata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and spikelet clusters that produce small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
