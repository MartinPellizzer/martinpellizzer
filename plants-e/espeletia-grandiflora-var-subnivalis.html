                    <h1>Espeletia grandiflora var. subnivalis</h1>
<p>Espeletia grandiflora var. subnivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to subnival conditions, often growing near snowfields and in alpine meadows.</p>
