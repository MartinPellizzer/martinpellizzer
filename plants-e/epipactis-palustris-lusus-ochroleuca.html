<p>Epipactis palustris lusus ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy yellowish-green flower spike.

Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland areas, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
