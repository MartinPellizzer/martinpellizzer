                    <h1>Euphorbia boetica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia boetica, commonly known as the Sicilian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution.</p>
<p>Euphorbia boetica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and dry habitats.</p>
