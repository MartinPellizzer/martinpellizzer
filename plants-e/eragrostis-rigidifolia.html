                    <h1>Eragrostis rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Eragrostis rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis rigidifolia is often found in grasslands, rocky outcrops, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
