                    <h1>Echinops malacophyllus</h1>
<p>Echinops malacophyllus, commonly known as the soft spurge or Malacophyllus thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads and silver-gray foliage, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
