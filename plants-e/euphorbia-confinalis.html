                    <h1>Euphorbia confinalis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia confinalis, commonly known as the coastal euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its modified inflorescences containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
