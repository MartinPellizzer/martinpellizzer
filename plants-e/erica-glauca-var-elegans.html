                    <h1>Erica glauca var. elegans</h1>
<p>Erica glauca var. elegans, commonly known as the silver heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to its deep green stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
