                    <h1>Endiandra tooram</h1>
<p>Endiandra tooram, commonly known as the Tooram ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark grey to black bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional tool-making and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Endiandra tooram is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
