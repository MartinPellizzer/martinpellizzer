<p>Eragrostis subsecunda, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle.
