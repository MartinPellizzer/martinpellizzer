<p>Eriogonum codium, commonly known as the codium buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, soft hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriogonum codium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
