<p>Eucalyptus × reticulata, commonly known as the honey gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Eucalyptus gunnii and Eucalyptus camaldulensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that displays a range of colors from white to grey. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinct aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × reticulata is native to southern Australia and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats.</p>
