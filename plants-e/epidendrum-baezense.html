<p>Epidendrum baezense, commonly known as the Baez's orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are characterized by their vibrant colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Epidendrum baezense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
