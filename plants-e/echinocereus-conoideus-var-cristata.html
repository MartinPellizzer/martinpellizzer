                    <h1>Echinocereus conoideus var. cristata</h1>
<p>Echinocereus conoideus var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the hedgehog cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crest-like growth pattern, which sets it apart from the typical cylindrical shape of its parent species. It features spiny stems covered in white to yellowish areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. The flowers are typically pink to red, blooming in spring and adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's rugged form.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
