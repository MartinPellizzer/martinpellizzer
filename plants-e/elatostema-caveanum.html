<p>Elatostema caveanum, commonly known as the cave bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Elatostema caveanum is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
