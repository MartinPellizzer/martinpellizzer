                    <h1>Eranthemum austrosinense var. pubipetalum</h1>
<p>Eranthemum austrosinense var. pubipetalum, commonly known as the pubescent petal eranthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a pubescent (hairy) surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
