<p>Euphorbia pseudoserpyllifolia f. villosa, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
