                    <h1>Euphorbia polygona var. noorsveldensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia polygona var. noorsveldensis, commonly known as the Noorsveld euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually spiny or reduced, contributing to its defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
