                    <h1>Ebenus hillebrandii</h1>
<p>Ebenus hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is an important component of alpine vegetation.</p>
<p>Ebenus hillebrandii is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
