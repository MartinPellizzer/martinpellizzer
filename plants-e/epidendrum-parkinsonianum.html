<p>Epidendrum parkinsonianum, commonly known as the Parkinson's Epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces long, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, fragrant flowers. The plant typically has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum parkinsonianum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
