                    <h1>Erophila vulgaris var. majuscula</h1>
<p>Erophila vulgaris var. majuscula, commonly known as the greater watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and canals. Its small, white flowers appear in summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Erophila vulgaris var. majuscula is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats that can alter aquatic ecosystems.</p>
