<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate field horsetail, is a variant of the water horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near water bodies. It thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils, such as those found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is known for its ability to tolerate and sometimes colonize disturbed or flooded areas.</p>
