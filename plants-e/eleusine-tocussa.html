<p>Eleusine tocussa, commonly known as African lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has potential for use in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
