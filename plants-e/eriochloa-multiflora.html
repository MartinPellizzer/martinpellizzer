                    <h1>Eriochloa multiflora</h1>
<p>Eriochloa multiflora, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Eriochloa multiflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions.</p>
