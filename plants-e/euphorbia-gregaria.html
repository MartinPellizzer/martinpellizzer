                    <h1>Euphorbia gregaria</h1>
<p>Euphorbia gregaria, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia gregaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
