                    <h1>Eriocaulon sharmae</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon sharmae, commonly known as the Sharma's spike-rush, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Eriocaulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white flowers. Native to the wetlands of India, this plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high humidity. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eriocaulon sharmae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
