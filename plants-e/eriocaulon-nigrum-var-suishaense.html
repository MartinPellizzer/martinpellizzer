<p>Eriocaulon nigrum var. suishaense, commonly known as the Suisha black spikegrass, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, shaded wetlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
