<p>Elynanthus bifidus, commonly known as the bifid milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Elynanthus bifidus is often used in restoration projects because of its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
