<p>Epidendrum clavatum, commonly known as the clustered epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum clavatum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
