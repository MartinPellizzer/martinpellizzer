<p>Erigeron eatonii subsp.</p>
<p>plantagineus, commonly known as the showy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, daisy-like white to pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native range.</p>
