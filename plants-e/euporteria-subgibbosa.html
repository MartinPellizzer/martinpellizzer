<p>Euporteria subgibbosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf gall midge, is a small plant that belongs to the family Eriocrystaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of hairy, fleshy leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
<p>Euporteria subgibbosa is often found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>
