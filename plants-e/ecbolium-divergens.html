                    <h1>Ecbolium divergens</h1>
<p>Ecbolium divergens, commonly known as the diverging bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are its primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Ecbolium divergens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
