<p>Eremiolirion amboense, commonly known as the Mozambican feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the dry regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
