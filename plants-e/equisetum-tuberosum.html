                    <h1>Equisetum tuberosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum tuberosum, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant contains high levels of silica, giving it a rigid, grass-like appearance and making it resistant to grazing. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Equisetum tuberosum is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores, and it plays a role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
