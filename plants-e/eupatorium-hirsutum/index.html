                            <h1>Eupatorium Hirsutum</h1>
<p>Eupatorium hirsutum, scientifically known as Eupatorium hirsutum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is commonly referred to as boneset due to the arrangement of its stems resembling the bones of a skeleton. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its fragrant white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its ornamental value, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
