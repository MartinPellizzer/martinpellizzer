<p>Eloyella mendietae, commonly known as the Mendietas' eloyella, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
