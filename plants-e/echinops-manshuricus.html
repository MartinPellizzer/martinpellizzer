<p>Echinops manshuricus, commonly known as the Manchurian thistle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a spiky globe, which are a defining feature of the genus Echinops. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinops manshuricus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist through the winter.</p>
