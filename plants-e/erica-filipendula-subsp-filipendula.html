<p>Erica filipendula subsp.</p>
<p>filipendula, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
