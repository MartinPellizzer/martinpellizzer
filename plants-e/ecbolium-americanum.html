<p>Ecbolium americanum, commonly known as the American burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny, pod-like fruits that cling to passing animals. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread via its persistent seed pods.</p>
