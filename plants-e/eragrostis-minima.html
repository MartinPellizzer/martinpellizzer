<p>Eragrostis minima, commonly known as little barleygrass, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis minima is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
