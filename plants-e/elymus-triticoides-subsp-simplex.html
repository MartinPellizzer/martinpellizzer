<p>Elymus triticoides subsp.</p>
<p>simplex, commonly known as the simple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
