                    <h1>Echinochloa holciformis</h1>
<p>Echinochloa holciformis, commonly known as the rigid false brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>E. holciformis is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
