                    <h1>Echinocactus pygmaeus var. phaeodiscus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus pygmaeus var. phaeodiscus, commonly known as the phaeodiscus cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in thick, ribbed segments that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
