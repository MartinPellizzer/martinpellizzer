                    <h1>Elleanthus conifer</h1>
<p>Elleanthus conifer, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across diverse habitats. Elleanthus conifer thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
