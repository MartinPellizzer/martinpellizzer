                    <h1>Euphorbia graminea var. virgata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia graminea var. virgata, commonly known as the silver grass euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
