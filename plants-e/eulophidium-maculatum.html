                    <h1>Eulophidium maculatum</h1>
<p>Eulophidium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted gall midge, is a small insect rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>However, it is known for inducing galls on the leaves of certain plants, particularly those in the genus *Eucalyptus*. The galls formed by this species are often characterized by their distinctive spotted appearance. These galls serve as protective structures for the developing larvae of the midge.</p>
<p>The interaction between *Eulophidium maculatum* and its host plants is an example of a specialized herbivory relationship in ecological systems.</p>
