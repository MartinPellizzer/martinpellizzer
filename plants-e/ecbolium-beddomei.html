<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a succulent stem and produces small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Ecbolium beddomei is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
