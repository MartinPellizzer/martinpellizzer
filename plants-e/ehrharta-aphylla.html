                    <h1>Ehrharta aphylla</h1>
<p>Ehrharta aphylla, commonly known as the hairless grass or Indian grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its lack of hairy leaves gives it a smooth, glossy appearance, and it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Ehrharta aphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
