                    <h1>Eriogonum leptophyllum var. leptophyllum</h1>
<p>Eriogonum leptophyllum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as desert buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
