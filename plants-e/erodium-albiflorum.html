<p>Erodium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered bedstraw, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and dry, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
