                    <h1>Echinochloa reptans</h1>
<p>Echinochloa reptans, commonly known as匍匐牛筋草, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with nodes that root at the base, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wet or disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
