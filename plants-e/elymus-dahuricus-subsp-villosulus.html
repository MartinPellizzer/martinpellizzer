<p>Elymus dahuricus subsp.</p>
<p>villosulus, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the dense pubescence on its leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with lemmas that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Its robust root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects.</p>
