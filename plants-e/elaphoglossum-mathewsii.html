                    <h1>Elaphoglossum mathewsii</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum mathewsii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
