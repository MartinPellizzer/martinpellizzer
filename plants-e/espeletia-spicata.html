<p>Espeletia spicata, commonly known as the "Puya" or "Snowflower," is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, spiky leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous small, often brightly colored flowers. Espeletia spicata thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Andean ecosystems.</p>
