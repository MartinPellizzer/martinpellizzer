                    <h1>Elatostema cuspidatum var. dolichoceras</h1>
<p>Elatostema cuspidatum var. dolichoceras, commonly known as the slender-tipped elatostema, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to humid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
