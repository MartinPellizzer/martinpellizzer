                    <h1>Euphorbia glareosa var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia glareosa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The silky hairs on its stems provide protection against intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
