<p>Eragrostis willdenowiana, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
