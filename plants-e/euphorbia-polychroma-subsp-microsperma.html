<p>Euphorbia polychroma subsp.</p>
<p>microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually small and often reduced to spines, a common feature in many euphorbias for deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The subspecies microsperma is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other subspecies of Euphorbia polychroma.</p>
