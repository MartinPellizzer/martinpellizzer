                    <h1>Euphorbia megalantha var. hirtiflora</h1>
<p>Euphorbia megalantha var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
