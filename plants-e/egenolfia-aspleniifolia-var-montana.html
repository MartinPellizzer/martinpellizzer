<p>Egenolfia aspleniifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
