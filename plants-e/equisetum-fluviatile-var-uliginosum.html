                    <h1>Equisetum fluviatile var. uliginosum</h1>
<p>Equisetum fluviatile var. uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found near the soil surface. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This variety is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
