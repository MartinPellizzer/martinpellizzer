<p>Euphorbia capitellata var. laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
