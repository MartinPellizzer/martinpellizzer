<p>Enchylaena decalvans, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly outlines against the foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance.</p>
