                    <h1>Epidendrum nubium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum nubium, commonly known as the Cloud Epidendrum, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees or rocks, often in shaded forest canopies.</p>
<p>Epidendrum nubium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
