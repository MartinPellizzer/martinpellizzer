                    <h1>Escallonia callcottiae var. fernandeziana</h1>
<p>Escallonia callcottiae var. fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandeziana Escallonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering.</p>
