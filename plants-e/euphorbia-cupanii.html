<p>Euphorbia cupanii, commonly known as the Cupani's spurge, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with paired, fleshy, spiny leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
