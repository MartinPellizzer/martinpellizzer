<p>Ephedra alata subsp.</p>
<p>monjauzeana, commonly known as the narrowleaf ephedra, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its alkaloid content, it is also considered a controlled substance in many regions.</p>
