                    <h1>Ehrharta gigantea var. neesii</h1>
<p>Ehrharta gigantea var. neesii, commonly known as giant lovegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dryland environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a valuable forage plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
