<p>It is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
