<p>Empogona welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest surviving plant species, with fossil records dating back over 100 million years. The plant has a distinctive structure with two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It also possesses a woody stem that can reach several meters in height, often with a thick, corky bark.</p>
<p>Its survival in extreme desert conditions is due to its specialized adaptations, including deep root systems and the ability to store water efficiently.</p>
