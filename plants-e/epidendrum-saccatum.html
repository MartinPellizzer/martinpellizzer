                    <h1>Epidendrum saccatum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum saccatum, commonly known as the bag-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, saccate (sac-like) leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry or shaded habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Epidendrum saccatum is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
