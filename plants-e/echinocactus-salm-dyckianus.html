<p>Echinocactus salm-dyckianus, commonly known as the Salm-Dyck's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical shape and dense, spiny ribs that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing underground water.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in desert environments.</p>
