                    <h1>Echinochloa crus-galli f. submutica</h1>
<p>Echinochloa crus-galli f. submutica, commonly known as rough barnyardgrass, is a grass species characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It is a common weed found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and has spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, with prominent veins and a rough surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with the typical form of E. crus-galli due to similar growth habits and flowering structures.</p>
