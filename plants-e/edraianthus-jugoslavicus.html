                    <h1>Edraianthus jugoslavicus</h1>
<p>Edraianthus jugoslavicus, commonly known as the Yugoslav edraianthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals and a prominent tube, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
