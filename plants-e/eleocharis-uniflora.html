<p>Eleocharis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower spike rush, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces a single, erect spike of small, clustered flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
