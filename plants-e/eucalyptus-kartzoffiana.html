<p>Eucalyptus kartzoffiana, commonly known as the Karstoff's eucalyptus, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in association with other rainforest species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens.</p>
