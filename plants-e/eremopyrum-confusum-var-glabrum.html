<p>Eremopyrum confusum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth eremopyrum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) surface, lacking the hairy texture found in other varieties of the species.</p>
