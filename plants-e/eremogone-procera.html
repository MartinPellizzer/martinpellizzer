<p>Eremogone procera, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Eremogone procera is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
