                    <h1>Esenbeckia coriacea</h1>
<p>Esenbeckia coriacea, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Esenbeckia coriacea is now considered an endangered species.</p>
