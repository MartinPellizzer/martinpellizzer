                    <h1>Eriocaulon trinianum</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon trinianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon trinianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
