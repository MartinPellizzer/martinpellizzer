                    <h1>Erigeron alpinus var. uniflorus</h1>
<p>Erigeron alpinus var. uniflorus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to high-altitude landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its single flower per head, unlike the more common multi-flowered form of Erigeron alpinus.</p>
