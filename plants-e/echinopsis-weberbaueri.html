                    <h1>Echinopsis weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Echinopsis weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as moths and bats. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echinopsis weberbaueri is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
