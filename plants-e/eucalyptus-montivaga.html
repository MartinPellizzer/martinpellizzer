                    <h1>Eucalyptus montivaga</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus montivaga, commonly known as the mountain eucalyptus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, globular clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. Its bark is typically smooth and peels off in thin, papery layers, and it is well adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus montivaga plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
