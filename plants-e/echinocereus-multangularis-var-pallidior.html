                    <h1>Echinocereus multangularis var. pallidior</h1>
<p>Echinocereus multangularis var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
