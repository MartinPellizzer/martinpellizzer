<p>It features a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling during cultivation.</p>
