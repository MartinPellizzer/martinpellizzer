                    <h1>Epidendrum lancifolium</h1>
<p>Epidendrum lancifolium, commonly known as the lance-leaf epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum lancifolium is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
