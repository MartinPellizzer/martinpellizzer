<p>Elaphoglossum opacum, commonly known as the opacous holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinct, often dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid, cool conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum opacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
