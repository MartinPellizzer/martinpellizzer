                    <h1>Echinopogon virens</h1>
<p>Echinopogon virens, commonly known as the green hair grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Echinopogon virens is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and botanical gardens.</p>
