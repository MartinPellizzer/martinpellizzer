<p>Eriope arenaria, commonly known as the sand eryngo, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Eriope arenaria is often found growing in dunes and along the edges of beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
