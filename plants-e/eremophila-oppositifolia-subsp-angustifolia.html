<p>Eremophila oppositifolia subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved emu bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
