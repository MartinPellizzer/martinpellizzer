<p>Eriopsis fuerstenbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in dry landscapes.</p>
