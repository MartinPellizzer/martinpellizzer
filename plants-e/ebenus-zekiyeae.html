                    <h1>Ebenus zekiyeae</h1>
<p>Ebenus zekiyeae, commonly known as the Zekiye's bladderwrack, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fucaceae and is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically submerged in marine environments. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, which are covered in small, bladder-like air bladders for buoyancy. It thrives in rocky substrates and is often found in shallow tidal zones where light and nutrients are abundant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for marine biodiversity studies.</p>
