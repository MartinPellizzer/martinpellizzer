<p>Euodia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed euodia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Euodia triphylla is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine for its purported health properties.</p>
