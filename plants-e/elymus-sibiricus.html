                    <h1>Elymus sibiricus</h1>
<p>Elymus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Elymus sibiricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
