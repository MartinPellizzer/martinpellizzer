                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. distortum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. distortum, commonly known as the twisted scouring rush, is a variant of the common horsetail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its segmented, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its distinctive twisted growth pattern gives it a unique appearance compared to other horsetail species.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
