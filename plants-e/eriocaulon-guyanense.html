                    <h1>Eriocaulon guyanense</h1>
<p>Eriocaulon guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana marsh grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. Its flowering structures are small and clustered, producing pale green to brown spikelets.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon guyanense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its wetland environment and is of interest to botanists studying aquatic and semi-aquatic flora.</p>
