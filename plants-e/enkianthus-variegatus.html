                    <h1>Enkianthus variegatus</h1>
<p>Enkianthus variegatus, commonly known as the variegated enkianthus, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring. Enkianthus variegatus thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its delicate floral display.</p>
