                    <h1>Elymus × drucei</h1>
<p>Elymus × drucei, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Elymus repens (poverty grass) and Elymus lanceolatus (threadleaf wheatgrass), resulting in a plant with unique genetic traits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Elymus × drucei is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and for its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
