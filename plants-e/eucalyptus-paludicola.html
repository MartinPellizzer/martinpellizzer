                    <h1>Eucalyptus paludicola</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus paludicola, commonly known as the swamp gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to wetland areas of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or white bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, globular flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Eucalyptus paludicola thrives in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the fluctuating water conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
