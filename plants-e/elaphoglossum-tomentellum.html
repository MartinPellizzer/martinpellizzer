<p>Elaphoglossum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum tomentellum is found primarily in the temperate regions of the Americas, particularly in the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
