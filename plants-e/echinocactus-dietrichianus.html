<p>Echinocactus dietrichianus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinocactus dietrichianus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
