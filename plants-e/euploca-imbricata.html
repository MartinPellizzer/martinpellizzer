                    <h1>Euploca imbricata</h1>
<p>Euploca imbricata, commonly known as the coastal daisy or beach daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
