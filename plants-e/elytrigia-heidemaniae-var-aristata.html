<p>Elytrigia heidemaniae var. aristata, commonly known as the aristate heidemania grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
