                    <h1>Euphorbia sonorae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran devil's backbone, is a succulent shrub native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive appearance with thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are its unique floral structures rather than true flowers. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sonorae is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
