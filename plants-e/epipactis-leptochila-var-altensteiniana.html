<p>Epipactis leptochila var. altensteiniana, commonly known as the Altenstein's helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers with purple spots. This variant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with coniferous trees. The plant is notable for its complex pollination mechanism, which involves specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
