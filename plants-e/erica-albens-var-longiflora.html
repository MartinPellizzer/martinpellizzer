                    <h1>Erica albens var. longiflora</h1>
<p>Erica albens var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Portugal and northern Spain.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
