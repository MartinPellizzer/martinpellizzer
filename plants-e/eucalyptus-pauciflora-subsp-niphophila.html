<p>Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>niphophila, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and silver-blue foliage that helps it withstand cold and snowy conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in thin layers, revealing a smooth, pale inner bark.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
