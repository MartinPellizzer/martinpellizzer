                    <h1>Euphorbia astroites var. heterappendiculata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia astroites var. heterappendiculata, commonly known as the Desert Rose or the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flower clusters, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
