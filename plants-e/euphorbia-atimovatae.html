                    <h1>Euphorbia atimovatae</h1>
<p>Euphorbia atimovatae, commonly known as the Atimov's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
