<p>Eriastrum eremicum subsp.</p>
<p>markianum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native range.</p>
