<p>Eucalyptus conspicua subsp.</p>
<p>conspicua, commonly known as the red gum, is a medium to large tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and fuel.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland regions.</p>
