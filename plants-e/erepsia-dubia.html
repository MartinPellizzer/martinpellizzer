                    <h1>Erepsia dubia</h1>
<p>Erepsia dubia, commonly known as the rare desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, where it forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant's ability to survive in extreme conditions is due to its efficient water retention and photosynthetic capabilities. Its morphology varies depending on environmental factors, often appearing as a thin, dark-colored layer.</p>
<p>Erepsia dubia plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms.</p>
