                            <h1>Epilobium Hornemannii Var. Lactiflorum</h1>
<p>Epilobium hornemannii var. lactiflorum is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of western North America. It is known for its distinctive white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This variant of Epilobium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
