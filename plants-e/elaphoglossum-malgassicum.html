                    <h1>Elaphoglossum malgassicum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum malgassicum, commonly known as the Madagascar holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
