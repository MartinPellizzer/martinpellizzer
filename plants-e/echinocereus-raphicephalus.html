                    <h1>Echinocereus raphicephalus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus raphicephalus, commonly known as the pink hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, forming dense clumps. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
