<p>Eragrostis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eragrostis pauciflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland landscapes.</p>
