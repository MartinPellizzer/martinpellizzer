<p>Erica pilosiflora subsp.</p>
<p>purpurea, commonly known as the purple heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
