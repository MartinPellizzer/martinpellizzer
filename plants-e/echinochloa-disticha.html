                    <h1>Echinochloa disticha</h1>
<p>Echinochloa disticha, commonly known as slender barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its seeds are small, wind-dispersed, and can persist in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Echinochloa disticha is often considered a weed in rice and other cereal crops due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
