                    <h1>Euphorbia adenoptera var. indivisa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia adenoptera var. indivisa, commonly known as the Desert Holly, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its foliage is often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
