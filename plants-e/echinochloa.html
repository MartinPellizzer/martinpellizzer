                    <h1>Echinochloa</h1>
<p>Echinochloa, commonly known as barnyard grass, is a genus of grasses that includes several species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their erect, often hairy stems and spikelets that are typically bracted and clustered at the nodes. Echinochloa species are annual weeds commonly found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. They have narrow, elongated leaves with parallel veins and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to their rapid growth and competitive nature, they are considered problematic in many crops.</p>
