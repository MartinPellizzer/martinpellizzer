<p>Encyclia saltensis, commonly known as the Salt Creek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are typically grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Encyclia saltensis is an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
