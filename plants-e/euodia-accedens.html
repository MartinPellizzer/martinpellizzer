<p>Euodia accedens, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries. Its leaves and fruits contain compounds used in traditional medicine, while its ornamental value makes it a popular landscape plant.</p>
