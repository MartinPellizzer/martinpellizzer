                    <h1>Echinodorus grandiflorus var. ovatus</h1>
<p>Echinodorus grandiflorus var. ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf waterweed, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slight reddish tinge under strong lighting. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a popular and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
