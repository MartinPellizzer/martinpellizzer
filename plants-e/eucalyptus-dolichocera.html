                    <h1>Eucalyptus dolichocera</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus dolichocera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallet gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, greyish-brown trunk and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, globular flower clusters that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is fibrous and peels away in thin, papery strips, a common feature among many eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf mallet gum is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
