                    <h1>Elytrigia × drucei</h1>
<p>Elytrigia × drucei, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Elytrigia repens and Elytrigia bulbosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bear inconspicuous flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes but plays a role in ecological systems by supporting soil stability and biodiversity.</p>
