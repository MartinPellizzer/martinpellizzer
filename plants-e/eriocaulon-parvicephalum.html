<p>Eriocaulon parvicephalum, commonly known as the small-headed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
