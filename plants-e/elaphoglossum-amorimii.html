<p>Elaphoglossum amorimii, commonly known as the Amorim's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its rhizomes creeping along the forest floor and producing upright, spore-bearing fiddleheads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Elaphoglossum amorimii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
