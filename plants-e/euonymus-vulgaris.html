                    <h1>Euonymus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Euonymus vulgaris, commonly known as the woodbine or burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange.</p>
<p>Euonymus vulgaris is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
