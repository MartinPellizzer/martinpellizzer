<p>Encephalartos vangeertii, commonly known as the Vangeert's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. Encephalartos vangeertii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
