                    <h1>Euphrasia officinalis subvar. foliacea</h1>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis subvar. foliacea, commonly known as the broad-leaved eyebright, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“50 cm. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported eye-health benefits, though its botanical features are primarily adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
