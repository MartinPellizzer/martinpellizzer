<p>Euphorbia kanaorica subsp.</p>
<p>polytimetica, commonly known as the Hawaiian euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it can tolerate high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
