                    <h1>Erica setosa</h1>
<p>Erica setosa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Erica setosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
