                    <h1>Euphorbia corallioides var. denudata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia corallioides var. denudata, commonly known as the naked coral euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive branching stems that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has smooth, gray-green foliage with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish cyathia (cup-like structures) that contain the plant's flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens.</p>
