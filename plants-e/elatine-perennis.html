<p>Elatine perennis, commonly known as the common waterwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that appear above the water surface. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and is often found in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Elatine perennis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
