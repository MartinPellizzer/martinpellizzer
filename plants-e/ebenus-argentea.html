                    <h1>Ebenus argentea</h1>
<p>Ebenus argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, making it an effective ground cover.</p>
<p>Ebenus argentea is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
