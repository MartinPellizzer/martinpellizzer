                    <h1>Euphorbia garberi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia garberi, commonly known as Garber's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
