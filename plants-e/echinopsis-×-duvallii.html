                    <h1>Echinopsis × duvallii</h1>
<p>Echinopsis × duvallii, commonly known as the Duvall's moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species resulting from the cross between Echinopsis chamaecaulis and Echinopsis subdenudata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the evening. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is mostly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
