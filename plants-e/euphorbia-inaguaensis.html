                    <h1>Euphorbia inaguaensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia inaguaensis, commonly known as the Inagua spurge, is a succulent plant native to the island of Inagua in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
