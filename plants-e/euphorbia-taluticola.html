<p>Euphorbia taluticola, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
