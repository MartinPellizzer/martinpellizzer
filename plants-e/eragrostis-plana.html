                    <h1>Eragrostis plana</h1>
<p>Eragrostis plana, commonly known as flatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, flat leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Eragrostis plana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
