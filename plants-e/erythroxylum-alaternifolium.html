                    <h1>Erythroxylum alaternifolium</h1>
<p>Erythroxylum alaternifolium, commonly known as the red-leaved erythroxylum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf coloration.</p>
<p>However, it is not related to the coca plant and does not contain the alkaloids found in other Erythroxylum species.</p>
