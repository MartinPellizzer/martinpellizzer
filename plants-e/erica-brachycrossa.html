<p>Erica brachycrossa, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Erica brachycrossa is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
