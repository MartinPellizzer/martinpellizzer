                    <h1>Eragrostis depauperata</h1>
<p>Eragrostis depauperata, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to reddish in color. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis depauperata is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
