<p>Elaphoglossum mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
