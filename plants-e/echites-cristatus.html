                    <h1>Echites cristatus</h1>
<p>Echites cristatus, commonly known as the Crowned Cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, spindly stem covered in clusters of small, spiny leaves that give it a crown-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Echites cristatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
