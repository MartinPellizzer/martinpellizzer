                    <h1>Echinocactus capricornis var. senilis</h1>
<p>Echinocactus capricornis var. senilis, commonly known as the old man of the desert, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny appearance, with a tall, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
