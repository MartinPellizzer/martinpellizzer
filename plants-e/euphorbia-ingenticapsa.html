<p>Euphorbia ingenticapsa, commonly known as the horned euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
