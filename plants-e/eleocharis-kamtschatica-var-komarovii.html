                    <h1>Eleocharis kamtschatica var. komarovii</h1>
<p>Eleocharis kamtschatica var. komarovii, commonly known as the Kamchatka sedge, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Eleocharis kamtschatica.</p>
