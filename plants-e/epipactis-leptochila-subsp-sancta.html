<p>Epipactis leptochila subsp.</p>
<p>sancta, commonly known as the Santa Cruz helleborine, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
