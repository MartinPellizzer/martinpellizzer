                    <h1>Eunomia bourgaei</h1>
<p>Eunomia bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgai's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Eunomia bourgaei is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
