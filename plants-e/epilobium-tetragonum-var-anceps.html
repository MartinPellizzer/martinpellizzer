                    <h1>Epilobium tetragonum var. anceps</h1>
<p>Epilobium tetragonum var. anceps, commonly known as common willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks, roadsides, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in many habitats.</p>
