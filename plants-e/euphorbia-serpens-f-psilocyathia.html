                    <h1>Euphorbia serpens f. psilocyathia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia serpens f. psilocyathia, commonly known as the psilocybin euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, green stems that produce a milky sap. The plant's most notable feature is the presence of psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin, in its latex. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its psychoactive effects.</p>
