                    <h1>Elaphoglossum × heterophlebium</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum × heterophlebium, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Elaphoglossum tamariscinum and Elaphoglossum heterophlebium.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits from its parent species, including the arrangement of its pinnae and the structure of its sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
