                    <h1>Euphorbia dimorphocaulon</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dimorphocaulon, commonly known as the two-stemmed spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive growth pattern with two different types of stems—one woody and one fleshy—giving it its specific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically green and lance-shaped, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dimorphocaulon is often cultivated for its unique appearance and adaptability to arid environments.</p>
