<p>Erodium triangulare subsp.</p>
<p>pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty erodium, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive triangular shape and a pubescent surface that gives it a dusty appearance.</p>

<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
