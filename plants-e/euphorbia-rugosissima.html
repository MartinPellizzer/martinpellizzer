                    <h1>Euphorbia rugosissima</h1>
<p>Euphorbia rugosissima, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and waxy, green leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers surrounded by fleshy, green bracts, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
