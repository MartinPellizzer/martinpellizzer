                    <h1>Eriocactus lenninghausii f. apelii</h1>
<p>Eriocactus lenninghausii f. apelii, commonly known as the Apelii Hedgehog Cactus, is a fascinating succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
