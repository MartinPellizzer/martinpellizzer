                    <h1>Elymus aristiglumis var. hirsutus</h1>
<p>Elymus aristiglumis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with awned lemmas that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
