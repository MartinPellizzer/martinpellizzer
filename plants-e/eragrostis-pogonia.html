<p>Eragrostis pogonia, commonly known as the purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
