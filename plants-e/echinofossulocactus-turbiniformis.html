                    <h1>Echinofossulocactus turbiniformis</h1>
<p>Echinofossulocactus turbiniformis, commonly known as the Turbiniform Echinofossulocactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, ribbed spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
