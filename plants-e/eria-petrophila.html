                    <h1>Eria petrophila</h1>
<p>Eria petrophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its resilience in harsh environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Eria petrophila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
