<p>Epidendrum carnosum, commonly known as the Fat Lip, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to grow in drier environments. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Epidendrum carnosum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
