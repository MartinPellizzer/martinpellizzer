<p>Ellipanthus unifoliolatus, commonly known as the single leaf sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and a single, linear leaf that persists throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
