                    <h1>Epithelantha micromeris var. unguispina</h1>
<p>Epithelantha micromeris var. unguispina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The varietal name "unguispinas" refers to its claw-like spines, which are a distinctive botanical feature.</p>
