<p>Epicycas tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. It produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
