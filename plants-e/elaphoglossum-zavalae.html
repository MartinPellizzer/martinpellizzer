                    <h1>Elaphoglossum zavalae</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum zavalae, commonly known as the Zaval√°'s holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Elaphoglossum zavalae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
