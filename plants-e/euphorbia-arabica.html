                    <h1>Euphorbia arabica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water to help it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Euphorbia arabica is often used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling due to its irritant properties.</p>
