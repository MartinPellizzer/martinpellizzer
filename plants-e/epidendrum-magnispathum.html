<p>Epidendrum magnispathum, commonly known as the giant epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the air.</p>
