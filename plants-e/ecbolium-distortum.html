<p>Ecbolium distortum, commonly known as the distorted ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems and small, clustered leaves that often appear in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dry, winged fruits. It is typically found in rocky or disturbed soils in arid regions, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium distortum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
