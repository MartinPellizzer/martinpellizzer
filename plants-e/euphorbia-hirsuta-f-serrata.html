                    <h1>Euphorbia hirsuta f. serrata</h1>
<p>Euphorbia hirsuta f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated rough spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with dense, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The serrated edge of its leaves distinguishes this form from the typical variety of Euphorbia hirsuta.</p>
