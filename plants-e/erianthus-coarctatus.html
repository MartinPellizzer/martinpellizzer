                    <h1>Erianthus coarctatus</h1>
<p>Erianthus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the central and southern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the grass family. Erianthus coarctatus is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
