<p>Ekebergia rueppelliana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, dark wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and musical instrument making.</p>
