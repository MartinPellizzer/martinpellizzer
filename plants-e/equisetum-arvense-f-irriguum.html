                    <h1>Equisetum arvense f. irriguum</h1>
<p>Equisetum arvense f. irriguum, commonly known as the water horsetail, is a variant of the common horsetail that thrives in moist or aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, segmented stems that are often green or yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically found near the water's surface. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
