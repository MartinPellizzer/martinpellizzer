                    <h1>Erica arborea f. albida</h1>
<p>Erica arborea f. albida, commonly known as the white heath, is a rare and striking variant of the common heath.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silver-white foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its typically dry habitat.</p>
<p>This unique form is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils.</p>
