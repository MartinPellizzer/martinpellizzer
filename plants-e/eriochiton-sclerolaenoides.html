<p>Eriochiton sclerolaenoides, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in arid regions.</p>
