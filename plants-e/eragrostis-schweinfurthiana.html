<p>Eragrostis schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green color, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eragrostis schweinfurthiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
