<p>Eleocharis lechleri, commonly known as the "Amazonian bulrush," is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are known for their medicinal properties, used by indigenous communities for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>Eleocharis lechleri plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
