                    <h1>Exostigma</h1>
<p>Exostigma, commonly known as the shield-like structure found on the lower surface of some fern fronds.</p>
<p>It is a specialized, hardened tissue that provides structural support and protection to the leaf blade. The exostigma is composed of thickened, lignified cells that form a rigid layer. It plays a role in reducing water loss and enhancing the mechanical strength of the frond.</p>
<p>This feature is particularly prominent in certain species of water ferns and is an adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
