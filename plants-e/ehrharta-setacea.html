<p>Ehrharta setacea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
