                    <h1>Euphorbia pilosa var. reichenbachiana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia pilosa var. reichenbachiana, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, soft, white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
