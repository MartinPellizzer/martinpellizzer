                    <h1>Echium dahuricum</h1>
<p>Echium dahuricum, commonly known as Siberian Thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking purple-blue flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces a large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Echium dahuricum is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
