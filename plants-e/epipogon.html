                    <h1>Epipogon</h1>
<p>Epipogon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a fascinating member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. Epipogon species are typically small, with pale or translucent flowers that often resemble the shape of a ghost or a flowerless spike. These plants are epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from their hosts.</p>
<p>Their specialized relationship with fungi and their unusual appearance make them rare and ecologically significant in forest ecosystems.</p>
