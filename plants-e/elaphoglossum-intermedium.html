<p>Elaphoglossum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum intermedium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
