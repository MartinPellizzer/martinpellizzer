<p>Epipactis papillosa var. imkoeensis, commonly known as the Imkoeen marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
