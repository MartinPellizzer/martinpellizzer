<p>Eremopanax, commonly known as the "false sandalwood," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often palmately arranged, and their small, clustered flowers. Eremopanax species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are valued for their ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>The genus is also notable for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm these uses.</p>
