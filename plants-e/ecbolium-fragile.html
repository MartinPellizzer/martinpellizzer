                <h1>Ecbolium fragile</h1>
<p>Ecbolium fragile, commonly known as the delicate ecbolium, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique morphological features. The plant is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in regions with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ecbolium fragile is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
