                    <h1>Euphorbia kilwana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia kilwana, commonly known as the Kilwa spurge, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbia genus. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a spiny appearance due to its thorny stems.</p>
<p>Euphorbia kilwana is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
