                    <h1>Echinocereus sarissophorus</h1>
<p>Echinocereus sarissophorus, commonly known as the long-spine hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stem structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its adaptations, such as reduced leaves and thick stems, help it conserve water in harsh desert conditions.</p>
