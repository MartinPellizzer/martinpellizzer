<p>Eucalyptus × hybrida, commonly known as the cider gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of various eucalyptus species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and smooth, often peeling bark that can range in color from white to grey. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and a waxy coating. This species produces small, globular flower clusters that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting nectar-feeding insects.</p>
<p>Eucalyptus × hybrida is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in the production of essential oils.</p>
