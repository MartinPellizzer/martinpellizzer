                    <h1>Evansia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Evansia dichotoma, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to the desert landscape. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall.</p>
<p>Evansia dichotoma plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
