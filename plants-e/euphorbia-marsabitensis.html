                    <h1>Euphorbia marsabitensis</h1>
<p>Euphorbia marsabitensis, commonly known as the Marsabit spurge, is a unique succulent native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing remarkable adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
