<p>Eremophila cunninghamii, commonly known as the pink mistflower, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched structure and its striking clusters of pink to purple tubular flowers. The plant produces small, woody蒴果 (capsules) that release seeds when mature. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Eremophila cunninghamii is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements.</p>
