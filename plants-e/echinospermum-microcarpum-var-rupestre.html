                    <h1>Echinospermum microcarpum var. rupestre</h1>
<p>Echinospermum microcarpum var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock echinochrome, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, spiky structure, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny capsule, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
