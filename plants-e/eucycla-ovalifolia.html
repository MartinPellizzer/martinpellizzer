                    <h1>Eucycla ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Eucycla ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
