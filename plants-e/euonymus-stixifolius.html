                    <h1>Euonymus stixifolius</h1>
<p>Euonymus stixifolius, commonly known as the stickyleaf euonymus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive sticky coating on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural habitats.</p>
