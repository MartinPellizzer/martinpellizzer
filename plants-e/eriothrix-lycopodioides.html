<p>Eriothrix lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its foliage consists of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>Eriothrix lycopodioides is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in soil stabilization.</p>
