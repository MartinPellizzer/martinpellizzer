                    <h1>Eucalyptus granitica</h1>
<p>Eucalyptus granitica, commonly known as the granite eucalypt, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the granite outcrops of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves which are often covered in a dense layer of white, felt-like hair. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and attract a variety of nectar-feeding insects and birds. This species is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or heathland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native regions.</p>
