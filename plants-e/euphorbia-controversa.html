                    <h1>Euphorbia controversa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia controversa, commonly known as the "Controversial Spurge," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, branched stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in small, white dots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, like many euphorbias, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation.</p>
