<p>Echinocereus enneacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a compact, spiny stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 inches.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
