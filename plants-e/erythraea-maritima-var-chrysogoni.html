<p>Erythraea maritima var. chrysogoni, commonly known as the goldenleaf sea heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
