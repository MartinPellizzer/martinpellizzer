<p>Euphorbia fischeri, commonly known as the fisher's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Euphorbia fischeri is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and should be handled with care.</p>
