                    <h1>Equisetum limosum var. minus</h1>
<p>Equisetum limosum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser field horsetail, is a small, non-woody plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili at the tips of its stems, which are typically dark brown in color. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical Equisetum limosum and is often found in more specialized habitats.</p>
