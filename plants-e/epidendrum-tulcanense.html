                    <h1>Epidendrum tulcanense</h1>
<p>Epidendrum tulcanense, commonly known as the Tulc√°n orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
