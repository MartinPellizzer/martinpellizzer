                    <h1>Exorrhiza ponapensis</h1>
<p>Exorrhiza ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponape root vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and woody stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots are notable for their exorrhizal structure, which allows for the formation of mycorrhizal associations with fungi.</p>
<p>This adaptation helps the plant thrive in nutrient-poor soils typical of its coastal habitat.</p>
