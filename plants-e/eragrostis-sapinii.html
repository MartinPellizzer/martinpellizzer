                    <h1>Eragrostis sapinii</h1>
<p>Eragrostis sapinii, commonly known as the alpine lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
