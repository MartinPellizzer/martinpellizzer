                    <h1>Eragrostis nigricans var. tristis</h1>
<p>Eragrostis nigricans var. tristis, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny grains, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural fields and turfgrass areas.</p>
