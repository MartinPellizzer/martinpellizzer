<p>Ericoides pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramidal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Ericoides pyramidale is adapted to harsh, acidic environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests.</p>
