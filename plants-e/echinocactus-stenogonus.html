                    <h1>Echinocactus stenogonus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus stenogonus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, segmented structure, which provides protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny body. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and xerophytic gardens.</p>
