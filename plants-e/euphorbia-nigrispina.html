                    <h1>Euphorbia nigrispina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
