<p>Euphorbia kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdag euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
