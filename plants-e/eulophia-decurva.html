<p>Eulophia decurva, commonly known as the curved eulophia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Eulophia decurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
