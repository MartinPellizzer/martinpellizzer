                    <h1>Elymus calcicola</h1>
<p>Elymus calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Elymus calcicola thrives in well-drained soils, often found on slopes and in desert grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
