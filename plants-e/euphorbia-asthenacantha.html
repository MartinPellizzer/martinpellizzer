<p>Euphorbia asthenacantha, commonly known as the brittle euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Euphorbia asthenacantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
