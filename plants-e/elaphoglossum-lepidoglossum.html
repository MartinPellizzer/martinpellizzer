                    <h1>Elaphoglossum lepidoglossum</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum lepidoglossum, commonly known as the silver-tongue holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive silver or pale underside, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
