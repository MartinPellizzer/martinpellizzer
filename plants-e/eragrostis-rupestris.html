                    <h1>Eragrostis rupestris</h1>
<p>Eragrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Eragrostis rupestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments.</p>
