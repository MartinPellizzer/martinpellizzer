                    <h1>Episcothamnus</h1>
<p>Episcothamnus, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
