<p>Eriocaulon baramaticum, commonly known as the Baramatic marshplant, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eriocaulaceae, which is characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, cottony layer of hair. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a spike-like arrangement, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Eriocaulon baramaticum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
