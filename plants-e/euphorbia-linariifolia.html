                <h1>Euphorbia linariifolia</h1>
<p>Euphorbia linariifolia, commonly known as the leafless euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny stems that resemble leaves, which are actually modified stems called phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
