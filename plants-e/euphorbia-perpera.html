<p>Euphorbia perpera, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, branching stem covered in small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are actually modified leaves called cyathia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Euphorbia perpera is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
