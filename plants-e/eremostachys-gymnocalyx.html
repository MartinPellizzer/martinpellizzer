<p>Eremostachys gymnocalyx, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates.</p>
