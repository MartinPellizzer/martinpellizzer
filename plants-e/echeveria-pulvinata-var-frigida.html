                    <h1>Echeveria pulvinata var. frigida</h1>
<p>Echeveria pulvinata var. frigida, commonly known as the Frosty Echeveria, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, and slightly pointed leaves that are typically blue-gray or silver in color, with a frosty appearance. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. It produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
