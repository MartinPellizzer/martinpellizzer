                    <h1>Echidnopsis thulinii</h1>
<p>Echidnopsis thulinii, commonly known as the mountain zebra cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with distinctive, ridged, and often spiny surfaces that resemble the patterns of a zebra. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Echidnopsis thulinii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance.</p>
