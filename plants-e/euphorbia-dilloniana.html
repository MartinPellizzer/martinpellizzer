                    <h1>Euphorbia dilloniana</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dilloniana, commonly known as the Dillon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, woody stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a unique structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
