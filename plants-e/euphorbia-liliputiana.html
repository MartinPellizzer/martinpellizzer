<p>Euphorbia liliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small, succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tiny, yellowish cyathia, which are the specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in arid climates.</p>
