<p>Eriocaulon limosum, commonly known as the swamp ricegrass, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments.</p>
<p>Eriocaulon limosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
