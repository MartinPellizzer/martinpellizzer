<p>Eriochrysis, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, sandy soils. They produce small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps them retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Eriochrysis species are also known for their ability to tolerate high levels of salinity, making them important components of coastal ecosystems.</p>
