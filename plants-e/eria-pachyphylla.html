<p>Eria pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat.

It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
