<p>Espeletia restricta, commonly known as the "Páramo flower," is a unique plant native to the Andean páramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Espeletia restricta plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing the soil in fragile mountainous regions.</p>
