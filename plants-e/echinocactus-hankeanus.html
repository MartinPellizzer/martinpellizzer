<p>Echinocactus hankeanus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's mouth, is a species of cactus native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, segmented appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens.</p>
