<p>Elaeagia arborea, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by bright red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sclerophyllous forests.</p>
<p>Elaeagia arborea is valued for its hardiness and is used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
