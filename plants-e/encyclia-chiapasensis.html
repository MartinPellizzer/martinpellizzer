<p>Encyclia chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas Encyclia, is a species of orchid native to Central America, particularly in the regions of Chiapas and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Encyclia chiapasensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
