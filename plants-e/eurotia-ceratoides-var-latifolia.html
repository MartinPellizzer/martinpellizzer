                    <h1>Eurotia ceratoides var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Eurotia ceratoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf euonym, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive orange-red capsules. Its fruiting bodies split open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Euonymus genus.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
