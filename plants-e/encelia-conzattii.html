<p>Encelia conzattii, commonly known as the San Diego fairy duster, is a flowering plant native to southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are active at night, making it an important plant for nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Encelia conzattii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
