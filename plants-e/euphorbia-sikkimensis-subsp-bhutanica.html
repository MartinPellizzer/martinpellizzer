<p>Euphorbia sikkimensis subsp.</p>
<p>bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese spurge, is a succulent shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at moderate to high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to arid environments, it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
