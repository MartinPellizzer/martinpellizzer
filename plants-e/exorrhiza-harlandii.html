                    <h1>Exorrhiza harlandii</h1>
<p>Exorrhiza harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's exorrhiza, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique root system.</p>
<p>It exhibits a distinctive type of root structure known as exorrhiza, where the roots are externally branched and often form a dense mat near the soil surface. This adaptation allows the plant to efficiently absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. It is typically found in specific ecological niches, often in moist, shaded areas with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
