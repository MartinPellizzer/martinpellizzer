                    <h1>Ectadiopsis suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Ectadiopsis suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Ectadiopsis suffruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
