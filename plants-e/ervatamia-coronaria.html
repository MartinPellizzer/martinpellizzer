                    <h1>Ervatamia coronaria</h1>
<p>Ervatamia coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
