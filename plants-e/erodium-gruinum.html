<p>Erodium gruinum, commonly known as the common stinkcup, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, cup-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Erodium gruinum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
