                    <h1>Epidendrum fragrans var. magnum</h1>
<p>Epidendrum fragrans var. magnum, commonly known as the fragrant epidendrum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellowish throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters, often lasting several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation.</p>
