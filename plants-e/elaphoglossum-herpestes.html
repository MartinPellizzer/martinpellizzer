<p>Elaphoglossum herpestes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular groups called sori. Elaphoglossum herpestes thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its intricate frond structure and unique reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
