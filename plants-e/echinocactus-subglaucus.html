<p>Echinocactus subglaucus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
