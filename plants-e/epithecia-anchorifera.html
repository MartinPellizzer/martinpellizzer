                    <h1>Epithecia anchorifera</h1>
<p>Epithecia anchorifera, commonly known as the anchor lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, flattened, anchoring structure at the base. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are produced in small, yellowish clusters on the upper surface.</p>
<p>Epithecia anchorifera is typically found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
