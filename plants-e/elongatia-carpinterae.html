                    <h1>Elongatia carpinterae</h1>
<p>Elongatia carpinterae, commonly known as the Carpintera elongated fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically clustered at the tips of its fronds. Elongatia carpinterae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
