                    <h1>Ecbolium heterocarpum</h1>
<p>Ecbolium heterocarpum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, pale green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by unique, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds. Ecbolium heterocarpum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert insects and small animals.</p>
