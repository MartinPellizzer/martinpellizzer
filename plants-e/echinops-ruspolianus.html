<p>Echinops ruspolianus, commonly known as the Ruspolian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical heads of white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and they are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Echinops ruspolianus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
