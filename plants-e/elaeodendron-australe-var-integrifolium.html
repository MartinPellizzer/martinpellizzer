<p>Elaeodendron australe var. integrifolium, commonly known as the Australian white wood, is a rare and distinctive plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically entire, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
