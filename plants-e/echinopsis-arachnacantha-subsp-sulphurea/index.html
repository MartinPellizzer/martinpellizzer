                            <h1>Echinopsis Arachnacantha Subsp. Sulphurea</h1>
<p>Sulphur cactus, scientifically known as Echinopsis arachnacantha subsp. sulphurea, is a striking member of the cactus family native to the arid regions of South America. Its most notable feature is its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom at night and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. This resilient plant thrives in harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, ribbed stems. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to frost and requires specific care to survive in non-native environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
