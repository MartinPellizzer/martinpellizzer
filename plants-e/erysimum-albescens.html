                    <h1>Erysimum albescens</h1>
<p>Erysimum albescens, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore does not perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Erysimum albescens is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
