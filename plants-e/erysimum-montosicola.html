                    <h1>Erysimum montosicola</h1>
<p>Erysimum montosicola, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of linear to lanceolate leaves, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Erysimum montosicola is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
