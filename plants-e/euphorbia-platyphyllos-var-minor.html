                    <h1>Euphorbia platyphyllos var. minor</h1>
<p>Euphorbia platyphyllos var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
