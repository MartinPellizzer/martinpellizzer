<p>Eriochloa annulata, commonly known as the ringed grass or annulate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Eriochloa annulata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways where it thrives in moist, sandy or clayey soils.</p>
