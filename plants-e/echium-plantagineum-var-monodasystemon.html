                    <h1>Echium plantagineum var. monodasystemon</h1>
<p>Echium plantagineum var. monodasystemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
