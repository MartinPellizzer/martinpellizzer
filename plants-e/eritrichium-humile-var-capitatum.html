                    <h1>Eritrichium humile var. capitatum</h1>
<p>Eritrichium humile var. capitatum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing annual herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
