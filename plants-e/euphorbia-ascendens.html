<p>Euphorbia ascendens, commonly known as the upright spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered with small, pointed leaves. The plant produces striking yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
