                    <h1>Ebenidium lagopus</h1>
<p>Ebenidium lagopus, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, a composite body that lacks the distinct roots, stems, and leaves of vascular plants. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree bark in arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions make it an important indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
