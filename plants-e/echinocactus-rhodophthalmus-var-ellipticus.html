                    <h1>Echinocactus rhodophthalmus var. ellipticus</h1>
<p>Echinocactus rhodophthalmus var. ellipticus, commonly known as the red-eyed elliptical cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, spiny areoles, and its most distinguishing feature is the vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the areoles. Its elliptical-shaped stems and unique floral display make it a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
