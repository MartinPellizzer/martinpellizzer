                    <h1>Ephemerantha calopogon</h1>
<p>Ephemerantha calopogon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its leaves for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
