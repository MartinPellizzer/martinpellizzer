                    <h1>Euphrasia disjuncta var. dolosa</h1>
<p>Euphrasia disjuncta var. dolosa, commonly known as the yellow tailed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with two lips that are distinctly shaped. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
