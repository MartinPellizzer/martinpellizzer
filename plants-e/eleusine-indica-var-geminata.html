                    <h1>Eleusine indica var. geminata</h1>
<p>Eleusine indica var. geminata, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
