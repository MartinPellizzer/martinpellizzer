                    <h1>Euphorbia sibirica</h1>
<p>Euphorbia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian spurge, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cluster called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, with succulent tissues that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Euphorbia sibirica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cold climates.</p>
