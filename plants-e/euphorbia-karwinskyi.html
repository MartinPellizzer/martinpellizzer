                    <h1>Euphorbia karwinskyi</h1>
<p>Euphorbia karwinskyi, commonly known as the Karwinsky's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic common in many succulents.</p>
<p>Euphorbia karwinskyi is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
