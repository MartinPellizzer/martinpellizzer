<p>Elaphoglossum sartorii, commonly known as the Sartorii holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the dry season.</p>
<p>Elaphoglossum sartorii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
