                    <h1>Euphorbia australis var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Euphorbia australis var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified flower clusters typical of the Euphorbia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling to avoid skin irritation.</p>
