                    <h1>Erysimum baytopiae var. asliae</h1>
<p>Erysimum baytopiae var. asliae, commonly known as the Asliae Wallflower, is a rare and striking member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vivid splash of color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its ecological niche.</p>
