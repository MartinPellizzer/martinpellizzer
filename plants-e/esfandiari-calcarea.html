<p>Esfandiari calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that often have a pale or white coloration. The plant typically grows on limestone soils, which contribute to its specific mineral requirements. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Esfandiari calcarea is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
