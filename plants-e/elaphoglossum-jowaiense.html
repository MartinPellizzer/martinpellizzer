                    <h1>Elaphoglossum jowaiense</h1>
<p>Elaphoglossum jowaiense, commonly known as the Jowai holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the humid forests of northeastern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in montane forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its sterile fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
