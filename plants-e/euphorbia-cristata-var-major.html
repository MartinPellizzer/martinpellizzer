<p>Euphorbia cristata var. major, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, branching stems that resemble a crown, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
