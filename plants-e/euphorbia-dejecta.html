                    <h1>Euphorbia dejecta</h1>
<p>Euphorbia dejecta, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Euphorbia dejecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive with minimal water.</p>
