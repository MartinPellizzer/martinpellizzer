                    <h1>Effusiella chlorina</h1>
<p>Effusiella chlorina, commonly known as the green moss cushion, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow cushions composed of closely packed thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It is often found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Effusiella chlorina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
