<p>Epicampes mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Epicampes mexicana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
