                    <h1>Eragrostis psammophila</h1>
<p>Eragrostis psammophila, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments.</p>
