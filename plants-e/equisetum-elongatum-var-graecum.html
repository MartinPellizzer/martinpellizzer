                    <h1>Equisetum elongatum var. graecum</h1>
<p>Equisetum elongatum var. graecum, commonly known as the Greek horse-tail, is a perennial fern-like plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a central, unbranched stem. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its primitive morphology and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments.</p>
