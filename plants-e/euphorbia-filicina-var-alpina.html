                    <h1>Euphorbia filicina var. alpina</h1>
<p>Euphorbia filicina var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
