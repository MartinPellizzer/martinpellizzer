<p>Erica physophylla, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a species of shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Erica physophylla thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for various pollinators.</p>
