                    <h1>Euphorbia xeropoda</h1>
<p>Euphorbia xeropoda, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, storing moisture in its leaves and stem.</p>
<p>Euphorbia xeropoda is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
