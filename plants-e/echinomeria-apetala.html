                    <h1>Echinomeria apetala</h1>
<p>Echinomeria apetala, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow, with no petals, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Echinomeria apetala is adapted to survive in harsh, sunny environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
