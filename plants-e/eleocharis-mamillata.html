<p>Eleocharis mamillata, commonly known as the millet sedge, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Eleocharis mamillata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
