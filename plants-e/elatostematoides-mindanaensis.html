<p>Elatostematoides mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao elatostema, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Elatostomataceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its leafy structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which aid in asexual reproduction.
