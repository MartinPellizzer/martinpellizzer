                    <h1>Eugenia strellensis</h1>
<p>Eugenia strellensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in its non-native habitats.</p>
