<p>Euklisia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and sharp spines, it should be handled with care.</p>
