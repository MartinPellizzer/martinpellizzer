                    <h1>Eragrostis diffusa var. arida</h1>
<p>Eragrostis diffusa var. arida, commonly known as desert lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, erect growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments.</p>
