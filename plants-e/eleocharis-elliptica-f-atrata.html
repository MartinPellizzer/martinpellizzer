                    <h1>Eleocharis elliptica f. atrata</h1>
<p>Eleocharis elliptica f. atrata, commonly known as black needle sedge, is a variant of the common spike-rush.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, cylindrical inflorescences that contrast with the pale green foliage. This sedge typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
