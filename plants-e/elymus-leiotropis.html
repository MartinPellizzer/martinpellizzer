<p>Elymus leiotropis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Elymus leiotropis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in arid environments.</p>
