<p>Erodium cicutarium proles pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the common erodium or velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Leguminosae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and small pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has become an invasive species in many regions worldwide.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
