                    <h1>Euphorbia × paradoxa</h1>
<p>Euphorbia × paradoxa, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which are adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, its milky sap can be irritating to the skin and should be handled with care.</p>
