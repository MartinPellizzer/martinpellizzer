                    <h1>Erythraea pulchella</h1>
<p>Erythraea pulchella, commonly known as the pink stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink, gelatinous cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Its fruiting bodies develop from a basal structure called a gleba, which becomes the visible cap as it matures.</p>
<p>Erythraea pulchella is a fascinating example of mycorrhizal fungi that plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
