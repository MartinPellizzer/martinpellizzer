<p>Eremophila petrophila subsp.</p>
<p>densa, commonly known as the dense eremophila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grey-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
