<p>Euphorbia verrucosa var. densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in dense, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny stems and toxic sap, it requires careful handling.</p>
